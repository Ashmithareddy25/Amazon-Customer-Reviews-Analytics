B009ZXT4BY|1.0|this game sucks.it gives like 15min for demo time.no imagination,they just copied block story.don't get this version or the paid version.HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This is a good read. Keep in mind that Chris is a professional soldier, not a writer, but I thought he told a good story, and his writers presented it in a very readable fashion.<br />It is NOT a manual on how to be a sniper. There is almost no technical information presented. Go take his class for that.<br />It is NOT an expose on the war in Iraq. The book was completly vetted by the Navy. Other than his occasional frustrations, you won't find a lot of recriminations or finger pointing.<br />It IS the story of an exceptional warrior and patriot, his duty in the Iraq war, and his family.

It's a compilation of seventy-six learned articles listed alphabetically, each researched and written by acknowledged experts from top universities worldwide.<br /><br />To cite just one example, H. Patrick Glenn's article offers further insights into the nature and aims of comparative law.  Like most or all the other chapters, his is logically structured to include an introduction supported by a wealth of further detail, and an extensive bibliography.  Certainly it is the extensive footnoting plus the bibliographies at the end of each chapter which make this encyclopedia especially useful to researchers.<br /><br />There are four types of entries.  First, there are articles on specific areas of the law and specific topics (e.g. criminal law, administrative law, family law -- and other areas such as insurance law, legal reasoning, legal culture, etc).<br /><br />Second:  there are entries dealing with such methodological questions as, for example, the idea of a European Civil Code.<br /><br />Third: certain essays concentrate on common law in general.<br /><br />Fourth: there are the reports on the legal systems of specific countries, from Australia and China to South Africa, Spain, Sweden Switzerland and Turkey.<br /><br />The encyclopedia does not claim to be completely comprehensive or all-encompassing.  The subject is just too vast. It is rather, as the editor Jan Smits puts it, `a first entry into a field of law, a specific topic or a legal system'.  As a result, the entries and the scholarship and insights contained therein have been carefully selected for their current utility and significance.<br /><br />Again, we would stress the value of this 1,000 page encyclopedia for researchers into this rapidly changing and increasingly significant area of law.  The bibliographies are vast and the book is rendered all the easier to navigate by virtue of its detailed thirty-five page index.<br /><br />It's not difficult to predict that this book will come to be considered (if it isn't already) as an essential acquisition for all law and business libraries.  The publication date is cited as at December 2011.s, for example, the idea of a European Civil Code.<br /><br />Third: certain essays concentrate on common law in general.<br /><br />Fourth: there are the reports on the legal systems of specific countries, from Australia and China to South Africa, Spain, Sweden Switzerland and Turkey.<br /><br />The encyclopedia does not claim to be completely comprehensive or all-encompassing.

031620157X|5.0|My almost 8yo son insisted I write a review for him.  He says it was a very interesting book.  In some parts it was sort of funny.<br />There is um like danger, adventure, um and the story was um a good book.  And I think that's all.<br /><br />My 6yo daughter says I thought it was very adventurous.  It's my favorite chapter book.  I guess that's all.<br /><br />As a much older dad, I enjoyed that my kids enjoyed it and while the writing would be pretty cheezy to an adult, the kids certainly enjoyed it.  My wife thinks it would make a great movie.

B007M45PMU|5.0|This album is absolutely brilliant!! The rustic sound: from the instrumentals to the vocals...just a good ol feel and some lyrics to make you smile, to make you think, to make you cry. Get this album. You will not be disappointed.
0345529057|5.0|The books came brand new and still sealed. This set is such a great price and the covers are in my opinion a lot nicer looking than the ones with the TV show all over them. These still have the &#34;HBO Series&#34; banner across the top, but it's non-intrusive and leaves the cover intact.
B004I744AS|5.0|I love it . So much more than just a dictionary. Will recommend it to friends and family members. I am sure I will use it often. Works very well on my device.
0385535147|5.0|Best hide and seek story since The Partner. The reader wants to walk with hero Bannister every step of the way to befuddle and outsmart the smartest detectives and their techie devices. Give us more of this, Mr. Grisham.

B00A12VW86|4.0|I enjoyed Uno, but this album has more punch, more energy, and more variety to it.  Long time Green Day fans will be reminded of Nimrod, Kerplunk!, and Foxboro Hot Tubs.  This album is definitely better to listen to while driving, partying, ect.
B000MVN8GK|4.0|LOVE IT! However I wish they showed more of what happened in the summer between Logan & Veronica. They just skipped all that and picked up on when they are already in college. But they could have done a flashback as they did in season 1.<br />OVERALL - Still fabulous.
B0042X9L6A|4.0|This is the first flash unit I have purchased and I am still getting to know this one.  So far, the unit works exactly as advertised.  It is easy to use and pretty intuitive.  The controls on the back of the camera are easy to use even as you are conducting a shoot.  I took our office photo recently and was able to change the settings on the fly after viewing the histogram.  I still need to understand just how far from the subject you can use this flash.  For right now, my flash photographs are 100% better than they were with the on-camera flash.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|I received this knife about 4 days after I ordered it(very fast shipping).  I own 16 acres of land in East Texas that is very hevely wooded...I'm in the process of hacking out a shooting lane or two, and this knife is a GREAT addition to my chain saw and machetes.  Very sharp out of the box, and chopping small trees/limbs is not a problem.  Very comfortable grip, and easy to sharpen. A few reviews knock the sheath, but I don't have a problem with it.  Over all, I'm very pleased with the knife and Amazon. I highly recommend this knife to everyone.<br /><br />L. Wheatley, McKinney, Texas
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I enjoyed the book.  I consider myself 'agnostic'.  I certainly do not like what religion has done to people.  I think organized religions are more evil than good. Because of the science background of the author, I found the book very credible.  I have always believed we are all soles or spirits who move through universes.  Heaven?  Maybe.  The book has given me  more to ponder.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|Excellent movie if you havent seen it yet and highly recommend it. Extremely powerful adaption of the Swedish version with top-notch performances by Patricia \\"Rooney\\" Mara as \\"Lisbeth and Daniel Craig as \\"Mikael or Mika\\" as he's called throughout the flick. Im not a fan of Robin Wright and feel someone else wouldve been better served in her role but alas its a powerful movie as I stated above. Some of the scenes are just off the rails and suspenseful especially a certain \\"revenge\\" scene that Lisbeth enacts on her new \\"guardian of the State.\\" Be prepared is all I have to say. A big hit in my book and would love to see more of Stieg Larsson's books made into films with Mara and Craig at the top of the ticket.
B002RI9SC4|5.0|Wonderful book as are all the rest of Twilight Saga.Didn't want it to end, can't wait to see Breaking Dawn 2.I reread all of the books in preperation for the last (sob) film.

B008Y1YJ90|5.0|I watched ARTHUR CHRISTMAS with only the vaguest of expectations. I had assumed it would be standard, generically heartwarming Christmas fare. I wasn't at all prepared for what a delightful romp ARTHUR CHRISTMAS actually is. It has its share of heartwarming moments, but what truly impressed me was how non-generic these moments were. Instead, they were based in honest, human emotions, rather than manufactured Christmasy schmaltz. And even better than that, these moments appear side-by-side-and are even more often, merged-with a practically devilish sense of humor. This is an animated Christmas movie with razor-sharp intelligence and a real edge that works its own kind of Christmas magic while simultaneously undercutting the straightforward Christmas magic of other films (even as it paradoxically heightens it). Like a chocolate truffle sprinkled with sea salt, ARTHUR CHRISTMAS is as sweet as it is sharp.<br /><br />ARTHUR CHRISTMAS`s basic premise is that Santa Claus is not, in fact, the immortal, eternally senior citizen purveyor of presents that pop culture would have you believe but rather a title that is passed from generation to generation of the same family. The eponymous Arthur, voiced by James McAvoy, is the lovable screw-up son of the current Santa (Jim Broadbent). Arthur's heart is as large as his klutzy streak and he truly believes in the magic of Santa with all of his soul, something which can't be said for his older brother, Steve (Hugh Laurie), who-with his goatee impeccably trimmed into the shape of a Christmas tree-is corporate, hands-off efficiency personified and heir apparent for the Santa throne, despite the fact that he doesn't like children very much. Thanks to his guidance, the traditional sleigh has been replaced by a spaceship, the S1, loaded with the latest technology and filled with thousands upon thousands of elves, who take care of delivering the gifts to all of the houses with espionage-like perfection while the getting-on-in-years Santastands by as the company figurehead, taking credit for all of the hard work.<br /><br />But as impressive as all of Steve's glossy new tech is, it doesn't prevent a regrettable mishap: in all of the world, one child is left behind when her present fails to be delivered. While Steve considers that an acceptable loss, hardly a blemish on his gleaming record, Arthur and his ancient Grandsanta (Bill Nighy) refuse to ruin this child's magical day and so, armed with the old sleigh, a group of actual magic reindeer, and Byrony, an enterprising young elf from the Giftwrap Battalion with a never-say-die attitude and a punk sense of style (voiced by the wonderful Ashley Jensen, best known from UGLY BETTY and EXTRAS), they set out to set things right. And while the overall trajectory of the narrative shouldn't be a major surprise to anyone, the delight is in the details. The movie rockets along with a sense of creativity and inventiveness-and often sidesplitting humor-that far outweighs any of its predictable elements, and even those are delivered with such genuine emotion that ARTHUR CHRISTMAS never feels anything less than the most fun, high-spirited, imaginative Christmas movie ever.
B000069KE0|5.0|For you Chicago fans, don't forget that all of the &#34;B&#34; side songs are mostly just as good and some are even better!!! Arguably one of the best Chicago albums of all time. Let's not forget that their first album was the first to sell one million copies and Chicago 17 was the first album to go quadruple platinum!

B002KSPKRS|5.0|My husband loves this product he even purchased one for my nephew. It makes it so he can hear more background noise in his games and does better. Overall it just makes him happy. :)
B003719G40|5.0|I would recommend this book for all couples. It has enlivened our marriage already. I've noticed a difference in the couple of weeks since I started the book. I've not told my husband anything & his whole attitude has changed. Amazing insight into human emotion. I wish that I had read this years ago when it was first recommended to me. Totally worthwhile.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This book was fascinating.  The main characters back story was as riveting as the murder storyline.  It was a bit slow in the beginning but I'm glad I gave it a chance.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|So disappointed with this film.  Surfing the edge of comedy and dark plot makes the viewing just awkward and empty.  Burton's worst film yet.  Waste of time and money. :(
0316228532|5.0|I was quite honestly fascinated by this book. I started reading it because it was J.K. Rowling who wrote it and she is my favourite author. However, I kept reading it because it captivated me. I liked, loved, pitied, despised and hated the characters. I raged against some and cried with the others. This is the kind of book that makes you think. It makes you evaluate your own self, your own worth, your own values. What would you do? Would you do anything at all? Would you just go past, not caring, because it's not your problem, not your fight? Would such circumstances make you crumble or rise? Would they bring out the worst or the best in you? I think that these are all very important questions and I applaud J.K. Rowling for raising them in such a brutal, honest way, not being afraid of using the language and the imagery that will appal and repel, showing the ugly side of life that so many of us pretend not to see, though it exists right next to us, and the inevitability of tragedy that comes from neglect, irresponsibility and abandonment. I think it took a lot of courage to write about all of this, knowing, as she did, that such a book would raise many objections, that its worth would be overlooked because of who she is, its language would be abused, its subject matter misunderstood and ridiculed. It made me cry. It broke my heart. But it gave me hope too. I know that the story didn't come to an end with the full stop. I know that it lives on and that there are characters there who will try to make a difference, who have found their worth and their path in life.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|This is an extremely understated movie. The acting was superb and the story was clever; definitely a layer cake. I honestly had no desire to see this film- funny that it is now a favorite. To everyone sick to death of the monotony of Hollywood- I highly recommend this film!!
B0035XVVDY|5.0|A great film with some interesting twists on the man out for revenge story. I don't really care for the conclusion of the film, but even though I was rooting for a differnt outcome visually the end is still very cool.
B007SGM084|5.0|I literally could not put these books down! I was just glad that all three books were out before I started so I didn't have to wait for the other ones. I wholeheartedly recommend these books!
1423140605|5.0|I loved this book. It is definitely worth the wait to read it. After Percy and Jason had been sent to opposite camps in the first two Heroes of Olympus books, the camps are reunited here. The book is written from the perspective of Percy, Annabeth, and Leo mostly (I think there was one section from Piper) but I really enjoyed the different perspectives. It definitely made me feel closer to more of the characters. The twists and turns in this book continue to move the plot along and further develop Riordan's characters. I won't go into much detail because I don't want to give away any spoilers. You should read the book instead.<br /><br />The one change I felt in this book compared to previous ones is that the book it may not be for a really young crowd. Similar to Harry Potter and the way the books became more appropriate for older readers as the characters aged, this series feels like it is doing a similar thing. There is not really a change in the violence and fighting but the relationships between characters are growing deeper, specifically with Annabeth and Percy. Nothing beyond kissing ever happens but thoughts, feelings, and suggestions are there.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The graphics are beautiful and the background music is soothing. very relaxing to play with challenging. but solvable puzzles. A wonderful game!
B005CGI4EG|5.0|Simply couldn't get a silly smile off of my face when I received this at the office, couldn't wait to pop up the first disc; simply the best sitcom ever, love the Bundys and doesn't matter how many times I watch an episode I still laugh my ass off, the package seems to be conveniently small for such a big disc compilation, but still, I'm afraid the discs may get scratched from being piled one on top on another on two big spindles, but then again with proper handling it doesn't seem to be such a big deal. So in a nutshell if you're a Bundy fan you definitely need to get this.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|Because this is a classic, I focused on the quality of the kindle edition. It was just fine. This will always be one of my favorites.
B000683VI4|5.0|I have seen this movie a ridiculous amount of times, and I still get all warm and fuzzy feeling during the romantic scenes. I'm glad I finally bought it. :)
B000174LUM|5.0|Puccini: La Fanciulla del West is a 1978 Deutsche Grammophon recording starring the amazing Placido Domingo in the role as Dick Johnson. Zubin Mehtha leads the Chorus and Orchestra of the Royal Opera House. The booklet contains all the lyrics, well-written music notes, short biographies of the performers. Truly a magnificent performance by Domingo. I very much enjoyed this fine recording. Highly recommended. 5/5.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Keeps you on your toes with some unexpected turns.  Enjoyed<br />it very much and would recommend it to anyone that likes an exciting read.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|I love this movie and my son enjoys it as well. As always there is little educational value to it but the story is engaging and the animation is excellent.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|good puzzle game. like the concept.. its really really really fun. yeah. u u u u ubu. love it.  ~ salsaber
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The \\"Walking Dead\\". Nough said.<br />Just in case you need more motivation:<br />Zombies, appocolypse, death, destruction and defeat topped off with a small group of people left in the world all fighting to be in control.
B006LSZECO|5.0|mind blowing. a true revelation to just how dark the human psyche can go. i was totally caught off guard
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is fun and addictive! The game runs smoothly and can be played for free without paying real money for extra coins. I would highly recommend this app.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I bought the series after having seen 2 episodes of season 1. The books were great--well written above a 6th grade level, characters were multidimensional and not sappy. I want more.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Once again, Vince Flynn has set the bar for writing an outstanding spy thriller with 'The Last Man.' The descriptions of the locations are right on the money from the layer of dust on everything to the garbage in the streets...places like Kabul, Islamabad, Bagram AFB, the heat, the flies...it is almost as if you are there! The story reads as if it is taken from the headlines: a missing CIA case officer with devastatingly valuable info has been kidnapped and there is plenty of sniping between bureaucrats as to how to solve this latest crisis. Mitch Rapp's approach, of course, is to start kicking down doors and demanding answers from our so-called 'allies.' This creates problems in the field and at home but our hero plows ahead and saves the day. There are a few interesting curve balls thrown your way as a reader as the story develops but once again, this author doesn't disappoint. This is a very good investment in pure escapism via the printed page!!
B0052RDHTM|2.0|I bought the book thinking I would get a good in-depth exposition of the events that lead up WWI. What I got was a rudimentary and  lacked real insight of world events and driving forces that lead to WWI and subsequent events. I really did not learn anything new nor gained any insight to the horriffic events of WWI. Additionally his characters were quite unidimensional and lacked true depth.  Took me a long time to finish (I always finish a book I start) since there did not seem to be anything that kept me turning the pages.<br /><br />I loved The Pillar of the Earth, but after reading this book I seriously doubt I will ever buy another Ken Follet book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is a wonderful compilation. A definite gem in the Sci Fi genre. I had real trouble putting it down. Look forward to more from this Author.
0307744434|2.0|I am only 31% into this book and I am forcing myself to push on.  I honestly don't think I will finish it.  It started out interesting, and I had high hopes for the rest of the story.  However, there doesn't really appear to be much of a story.  It jumps from one time period to another and one set of characters to another without much connection or purpose. The characters don't have much, well, character.  I fail to see where this book is going.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Amazing addition to the series in Joe Abercrombie's war ravaged world.  Some great new characters, several appearances from characters from his previous books, and lots of war, blood, revenge, savagery, and double crossing like only Joe can portray.  This is a standalone novel, but for the back story of several prominent characters I highly recommend checking out his previous novels- The First Law Trilogy, Best Served Cold, and The Heroes.
0694003611|5.0|I am so pleased to have found a nice new board-book version of this classic. Right-sized and sturdy- perfect for bedtime.
B0087HT36U|3.0|When I played, it was enjoyable. Except there are a few impossible levels because of the intro to the level.
0307200477|4.0|This is a great touch-and-feel book, very tactile, living up to its reputation- but I have to say the reviews about this particular format are accurate in that the spiral binding stinks.  My very first skim- the pages and the spiral came completely loose from the cover!! (With zero effort)<br /><br />I ended up putting it back together in the reverse manner (I threaded the plastic spiral through the pages from the back to the front-- opposite of how it came), maybe better?Anyway it is a good book, is a nice size and does come in a nice box/slipcover, making it easy to gift-wrap.<br /><br />Update: After several months now, since I reversed the spiral binding, I have had little to no trouble with the book coming apart. Only had a couple of prongs need to be relaced, a few times. My two year old enjoys looking at this book alone and it has held up.
B008I34Y6W|5.0|Very briefly, some perspective is in order here. Sgt. Pepper was the Beatles' One Size Fits All. Dark Side Of The Moon was Pink Floyd's One Size Fits All. The truth is, this is the masterpiece against which all others must be measured. Roger Waters pointed out that Meddle was the album where Pink Floyd &#34;sharpened their chisels&#34; and were then ready to make Dark Side Of The Moon. I think The Mother's albums similarly prepared Frank to make One Size Fits All. That's all I'm going to say. I hope you will first go out and spend at least $30k on an audio system. Then go get yourself a copy of One Size Fits All.
0399226907|5.0|I was concerned when I read the reviews commenting  that this book was too small- but it is a perfect board book, 5x7 size- and honestly I've seen larger versions where the purposefully smaller inside pages seemed lost and disproportionate- anyway I find it to be the perfect size and just a delightful book worthy of all it's praise. Very pleased!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|There's so much more happening in the 3rd book.  The author makes you feel like the characters in this book are people you know and really care about.  I really hope that, by the time I read the last page of this book, the author has a 4th book in the wings.
B008MM9630|5.0|this game is super fun and I live it! it is the number one played game on my kindle! great for people who love magic and farming!
B007BZM30M|4.0|I am happy with the transaction. It was smooth and trouble free. Its a song, so there isn't much more to say.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I had heard of this series, but had not seen it.  I loved it.  I can't wait for next season.
B0065IA4F2|4.0|I am happy with the transaction. It was smooth and trouble free. Its a song, so there isn't much more to say.
074322454X|5.0|With this book I have learned the kinds of bonds that were created between soldiers during world war 2.  Through the toughest of times how those soldiers stood by each other every day and night risking their lives for each other.  Excellent job by Stephen Ambrose.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game cant keep my eyes of this game. its so beast. you gotta buy this game. its toatlly worth your money
1451638450|2.0|I had really looked forward to this one--Ivan has always been a favorite of mine, and I hoped for some fast-paced fun. Unfortunately, this is without doubt the most uninteresting book of the Vorkosigan saga. There are nice moments, for example the scene of Alys and Ivan burning the annual death offering for poor Padma, but most of the plot fails to deliver...anything. There is no spark whatsoever to Ivan or By, not a single delightful turn of phrase or amusing plot twist. And seriously, I could see the divorce part coming from the moment Ivan proposed the possibility in chapter 5. I wish she had made this a novella rather than a full book.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|In this version, there is an online feature, which is good but you should use some things from the puss in boots version. There is no Bandito mode, no awesome firework swords and no achievements list, which neither has. It's still really addicting, but it's a downgrade to the puss in boots version
0061743526|5.0|This is a classic. I read this as a sophomore in high school and it is the only book I have wanted to read twice. The symbolism throughout to the issues of the era is so incredible. I would definitely reccommend this book to everyone above the age of 14. It is such a great read. Scout is such an inspirational character.<br />-Kaycedh
1452101248|5.0|I love this book and in just a few weeks have cooked at least 6 of the dishes, some several times which will become long term favourites.  I am going to do a 'Julia' and cook every recipe in the book.  Many great photographs and easy to follow instructions.
0743496736|5.0|Nineteen Minutes is by far one of my favorite books. I read it as a junior in high school and fell in love with Jodi Picoult's style of writing. This book kept me wanting to turn the page and I could not put it down. It was very unpredictable and such an enjoyable read. If you are interested in trials, a little bit of romance, and an all around good book, this is the book for you!<br />-a Satisfied Reader

In my case, I was using a PS3 - which Sony has always maintained as a very capable Blu-Ray disc player - and when I first inserted the disc, the player booted the disc, but after a warning or two, did not move past a black screen.<br /><br />To some, this may immediately be written off as a defective disc and be sent back together with a negative review. THIS IS NOT THE CASE.<br /><br />The Prometheus Blu-Ray release comes at a time when a specific firmware update for the PS3 (and possibly for other players) was released, and if you are not in the habit of regularly updating your firmware (whether you're just lax or do not connect to the internet with your player/PS3) your player will not be able to play the disc. The player however, DOES NOT INDICATE A FIRMWARE UPDATE REQUIREMENT, so it's important that you try to update the machine if your disc does not work. This is not a difficult process, since there are instructions posted online, and the machine's interface may also have an update option that's easy to follow & activate.<br /><br />If after updating your disc STILL does not work, then you may have a problem with the disc.<br /><br />I hope this helps! Overall, once you have everything up and running, this movie is incredibly gripping to watch at home on your HD setup!

0385523912|4.0|Nothing to Envy takes us to a place frozen in time. No internet, no smart phones, and no satellite TV. In addition, dating, freedom of press, and free markets are nowhere to be seen. Welcome to North Korea.<br /><br />Barbara Demick takes us through a journey of 6 lives in North Korea. Stories range from Dr. Kim, a devout doctor who works tirelessly at the hospital to Mi-Ran, a girl secretly dating a boy named Jun-Sang. The defectors stories are all from Chongjin, a city in the north east.<br /><br />North Korean defectors seem to have a case of Stockholm Syndrome-- they denounce the country as an evil regime, but often defend it in debates. They also seem to have a longing of life back home. South Korea is more developed; yet their friends, family, and memories are tucked away in a country they will never see again.<br /><br />Surprisingly, North Korea was more developed than South Korea after the Korean war. It wasn't until the mid 1960s where South Korea started catching up. By the 80's, it left it's neighbor in the dust.<br /><br />Demick did an outstanding job on research. The writing and stories are meticulously done. Politics, personal profiles, history and love are all crammed into the 300 pages. The book is fascinating, but be prepared for a dark tale. There's hardly an ounce of sunshine in the entire book. Demick mentions having been to North Korea several times on travel. She shared a few stories, but most readers would be interested on her own perspectives as well.
B00979CS50|4.0|It sounded like stuff that did not make it onto the Greendale Disc, except for Ramada Inn, Twisted Road and Walk Like A Giant. I give it 4 stars but not their best work. I am still going to listen to it, hoping it grows on my like most great music does. I will be seeing this tour in a few weeks, heard nothing but good reviews on the show. I do like GreenDale.

B007KAJG3K|5.0|Robert Downey Jr has been great as of lately in every movie he has been in (Iron Man 1&2, Avengers, Due Date, Sherlock Holmes), and this one is no exception. Robert and Jude play off each other so well, but Robert definitely steals the movie, as usual, and that is never a bad thing, and his comedic style is just always spot on.<br /><br />  Sherlock Holmes 2 is not quite as good as the first one, but what sequels are, but it is a very long way from being bad! 2 is full of action from beginning to end. Also the Holmes-vision is back, and I think this is one aspect that they improved upon from the first movie, and actually catches you off guard at first, and goes to show they didn't just try to replicate the first movie. There are a few surprises in this movie that will catch you off guard. The villain was written really well also, and proves to be a very good adversary to Mr. Holmes, and what really keeps you engaged in this movie from start to (surprising) ending.<br /><br />  If you enjoyed the first one there is no doubt you will enjoy the second one. Here's to hoping they make a third!
B004LWZWGK|3.0|The movie's just okay.  Lots of HUGE leaps of logic and plot holes you could drive a tumbler through.  Still worth buying for the sheer fun of seeing the conclusion to an epic run of Batman movies.<br /><br />With that said, the Ultraviolet only digital copy offer has got to go.  I (and nearly everyone else I talk to) hates that we can't download the iTunes copy if we so choose.  I don't even buy the movie with a digital copy anymore if ultraviolet is my only option.  The studios / distributors are leaving money on the table and alienating a lot of fans with this.

1451695195|5.0|I come from a family of born-agains, southern baptists, and agnostics. Then there's me: A guy who's always felt the presence of something that can't be explained-- but also has tremendous respect, love and knowledge of the scientific method (as a computer scientist). Nobody else-- on both sides of my family-- is like me; it's either black or white to them, whereas I see it all in between... This book confirmed everything I've ever felt about the spiritual realm AND provided it with as much scientific context as it could. I would have liked to hear more about: A) his experience in furer detail, and B) what exactly some of his skeptics said; but, overall I really enjoyed this book. It makes my 23-year old, younger brother's death less traumatic and more relatable I guess...
0312360258|4.0|I've heard a lot of things about the House of Night Series,but given my relatively short time of blogging, only about the latest installments and it all went pretty much like \\"It' s my guilty pleasure series\\" or \\"I only read it because I want to know what happens next\\".<br />But I mean there had to be reason why the series sky-rocketed in the first place so I needed to start reading it and the first book just had me in me after a few pages.<br /><br />The protagonist is pretty hilarious. And by pretty I mean, very snarky and sarcastic - it's just a bit too much sometimes, there were passages I didn't find very teenager-authentic. However, the narrator is actually a plus because the book just never gets boring.<br /><br />The set-up kind of feeling - sadly - joined me throughout the whole book. Zoey's situation at home and at school was cliche most of the time, the setting - especially the House of Night setting seemed just too perfect for me to be true.<br /><br />Leaving all of this behind let's focus on why I am addicted to this series now:<br />First of all - boarding school. I'm a sucker for boarding schools, always have been! And as soon as you forget that the House of Night is way too stereotypical and unrealistic it becomes the best school you could think of! I wanna have Zoey's classes and her room and the cafeteria and their mini kitchen and all that stuff!! Also, her group of friends is way cool and not even as cliche as you would think they were.<br /><br />And then, there is of course the suspense. That feeling that you just don't know who to trust. It drives me crazy and is the main reason why I need to have the second book! And the third! And all the others.<br /><br />So, overall Marked is not a brilliant high-fantasy novel. But it sure comes with a ton of magical boarding school fun!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|From Reading and Writing Urban Fantasy and Paranormal Romance<br /><br />At A Glance<br />I want to marry this book and have beautiful book babies with it.<br /><br />The Good<br />Abby is trying to live the straight and narrow life. She has a sinister past that she never wants to relive. Enter sexy, dangerous Travis. He likes to fight in the ring, sex up the girls, and flirt with everyone. But Abby seems oblivious to his charms. Trying to find a way to spend more time with Abby, Travis makes a bet with her that pretty much guarantees that Abby is stuck with him for a month. That's when the fun begins.<br /><br />Holy sheep shearers this was a fantastic book. It wasn't perfect but a book doesn't have to be flaw free for me to love it. When I finished this book, I missed reading it right away. I almost reread it the next day. I could not put it down and I don't even know why. Did you ever read a book that just hit you in the right way? There is something about the combination of the characters, the story, and the romance that made me fall hopelessly in love with Beautiful Disaster.<br /><br />First, we have Abby. I admired her right away. She's smart, funny, and kind, but she also knows how to have a good time. She's not afraid to voice her opinion or call Travis out on his crap. She was also flawed which made her feel real. She was way too stubborn sometimes and dragged out Travis's suffering for too long. But even the things that annoyed me about her were all part of the experience. I was genuinely surprised by what was revealed about her past but she handled it very well. I was like the characters in the book that got even more enamored with her once we found out her secrets.<br /><br />Travis went through a lot of stages as a character. At first he is so cocky you want to grinned your teeth. Then he is so sweet your teeth almost hurt. Then he becomes so crazy, obsessed, and needy you want to pull out your own teeth. (Okay, where the hell did my sudden infatuation with teeth come from???) Travis took me on a rollercoaster of emotions and I loved every minute of it. I think because he became best friends with Abby first, his love for her ran so deep that once they got together it physically hurt him to be apart from her. Even though it was a bit much, it was also cute. Who wouldn't want a guy that loved you that much?<br /><br />I was thrilled when Abby and Travis finally got together and so dejected when they split; it was like I was living their lives as well. I was emotionally invested in this story the whole way through. I think that's what McGuire is so great at: She draws us into the story without effort. I forgot I was even reading a book. I could picture every scene, every tear, every sexual encounter. (hehehe) Hey, don't judge, I have to get my kicks somewhere. ;)<br /><br />Even the side characters were amazing. America, frick yeah!!! Abby's best friend, America, is like the best friend we all want. She is loyal and supportive like no one I know. And Shepley, America's boyfriend, is the sweetest guy EVER!! I love him as much as I love Travis. Even Parker was interesting. I hated watching Abby be with Parker while Travis drowned himself in other girls. *Sighs* I wanted to yell at Travis and Abby as they tortured each other by denying their feelings. But it made for great entertainment!<br /><br />The pacing was spot on, the plot was well written, and the drama was plenty. McGuire gave us flawed characters that made mistakes but knew how to love with all their hearts. McGuire made me love the contemporary romance genre, and that's a hard thing to do.<br /><br />The Bad<br />I don't have to wait for perfection to give a book 5 stars. I rate based on how much I loved the book, no matter the good or bad. Suffice it to say, I loved this book with every fiber of my being but that doesn't mean it was perfect.<br /><br />There were three things that bothered me the most. I think this book was more about obsession rather thanlove. Travis was OBSESSED with Abby, and though I think they did love each other, this kind of obsession would be dangerous in real life.<br /><br />I also think Travis was too violent. I got uncomfortable as he beat people's faces in many a times.<br /><br />The ending was not my version of perfect. I can't say much since it would be a major spoiler but I don't like decisions that big being made by such young people.<br /><br />The Snuggly<br />So this is my first New Adult book. I was wondering how far the authors went when it came to sex. All I can say is yummmmm! I think this is the perfect amount of sexual content for older teenagers and so on. It's hot but not hugely detailed like you would find in an adult book.<br /><br />Abby and Travis may have had a disastrous type of romance, but it was still endearing and sweet. They were also sizzling and hot together. It really was the perfect combination.<br /><br />Final Thoughts<br />I am like depressed now that I am not reading this book this minute. I think I caught Travis's obsessive tendencies because I am bananas over this book. I have the ebook but I think I want to buy the physical copy just so I can hold it and sniff it. Woah, who said that? I think many people will love this book, and, unfortunately, many will not like it at all. It's not for everyone, but it sure as hell was for me. Personally, I think this is a must read. Highly recommended.<br /><br />PS: I am seriously going to reread this book right now. After talking about it so much, now I have to relive it.<br /><br />Quotes<br />\\"You can't tell me what to do anymore, Travis! I don't belong to you!\\" In the second it took him to turn and face me, his expression had contorted into anger. He stomped toward me, planting his hands on the bed and leaning into my face. \\"WELL I BELONG TO YOU!\\" The veins in his neck bulged as he shouted, and I met his glare, refusing to even flinch. He looked at my lips, panting. \\"I belong to you.\\"<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />\\"It's dangerous to need someone that much. You're trying to save him and he's hoping you can.

0061726834|5.0|When I first discovered the Bookblogging and vlogging community everyone was obsessed with this book. I saw it in every Favorites video, every bookshelf tour and those who had not read it yet seemed to be ashamed. Reading the summary on Goodreads I couldn't really see what the hype was all about, though. When it finally arrived at my door I almost regretted buying it. I'd heard that it was a dystopian novel and at that point - believe it or not - I was kind of fed up with dystopians, so I put it on my shelf and saw it sitting there - untouched - for the next twenty years.<br /><br />I was so wrong. And I'm so angry at myself for waiting so long to read Delirium. I think I can honestly say it's the best book I've read this year. By far. I found myself curling up on my bed refusing to eat or sleep or work or do anything until I finally reached the ending.<br /><br />What I loved most about Delirium (at least, I think) was Oliver's ability to put in words exactly how one feels in certain situations. Without giving spoilers, there were some very crucial growing-of-age moments in Delirium. Those days when you figure that somehow at some poin everything around you changed and that nothing will be the same anymore. as I read delirium I felt like Oliver truly understood and described what being a teenager feels like.<br /><br />This belongs to the second aspect I did not expect but enjoyed so much about Delirium: how realistic it still was. Other than many dystopians the world Lena lives in did not seem so drastic and radical to me. It was not completely different from ours. There are still normal schools and normal activities and although some people are poor it's not the kind of desperate poverty that for example Katniss Everdeen grows up in. Lena lives a life that is pretty similar to mine (and I'd guess to most teenagers') so it was easy to identify with her.<br /><br />The dystopian element - the fact that love is a disease in delirium - was really well done. I mentioned before that I was hugely suspicious about that part. Love a disease? Are you kidding? I was convinced that this idea could only be super cheesy and super superstitous. Oh, how was I wrong! Oliver did an amazing job making this believable, working it into Lena's world and mind and just making it a fact. You read the first few pages and you're like\\"Okay. I totally believe this could happen\\"<br /><br />Which brings me to Oliver's writing style. I actually said almost everything I wanted to say about that. I have a feeling she can put nearly everything into words. Period. Nothing more to add.<br /><br />The characters - although I missed the depth of some side characters like Lena's aunt or her cousin Jenny - were all in all well developed. The important ones, I mean. The reader could get to know Alex along with Lena - it was never too slow or too fast.  I liked Hana a lot , although that's probably mostly because of how she brought the \\"realistic\\" and almost contemporary - ish effect into the novel. Seeing the friends' relationship develop and change brings an extra plus to this already amazing book.<br /><br />All in all, I can only recommend you read this book. As I said, by now it's my most favorite read of this year and I can't wait until I can start Pandemonium!
B000000OY9|4.0|okay..i remember the day this came oiut..i raced home put it on the turntable and honestly thought it was the worst record ever made...and I've totally hated it ever since...id usually say it wasn't worth one single star even<br />however every few years i re-play the terrible albums by my favourite artists and this week i pulled this one out..Surpirsed to find its aged incredibly well...i like these curiously little forgotten records..not everything should sound like AFTER THE GOLDRUSH  or RAGGED GLORY....<br />Interesting is that this sounds like one of neils most personal ever set of lyrics..we now know that the eighties were an incredible painful and stressful period of neils life ,this was a result of his second son,ben,being born with severe hancap.<br />\\"violent side...bad news beat/..pressure..weight of the world..drifter..violent side..hard luck stories.\\" etc..neils never written such a bunch of intense,and depressingly harsh lyrics on any other album'<br />the reason the albums so loathed is the production..however ..yes the drums pound away..but they at least are real drums..the album hasn't got those atrocious electronic snare beats going through it that so many other 1980,s albums have..and its doesn't actually sound as terrible as 99% of other albums from the period<br /><br />give this another listen folks.....like all the so called bad BOB DYLAN albums..on reflection years later NONE of them are anywhere near as bad as we think
014241543X|5.0|I have a feeling I'm going to remember this novel for a very long time. Or more precisely I'm not going to forget it for the rest of my life. Really, it's amazing. I can't even put it into words. But of course I'm going to try anyway.<br /><br />What amazed me most,I believe was the overall feeling you get while reading the novel. Once you start reading it you just can't put it down. \\"If I Stay\\" is one of those books that makes you feel like you have lived in its world all your life, like you were a part of it.<br /><br />The characters are absolutely relatable. I fell in love with all of them at the very beginning. Mia was a great narrator and protagonist. She had a way of telling her story without exaggerating, she didn't need to use an enumeration of big adjectives to explain her point, everything she said was expressed in simple words which took away every chance for the novel to get boring or dreading.<br />None of the other characters seemed flat to me, they all had their very own edges and passions and none of them were those stereotypes you often see in novels. None of them were \\"typical geeks\\" or \\"typical mean girls\\" or something. They were just normal but very individual.<br /><br />The action started fast in this book but the author,Gayle Forman, took her time describing the different situations and emotions. She never used too many or not enough words. Also, everything just felt so real as if it could happen to anyone anytime. The fact that you don't get any hints on how the story is going to turn out was keeping me on edge and made it almost impossible to put this book down.<br /><br />I am not a musical person. Not at all. But the musical theme in this book just fit so well and is a huge part of the novel and I loved it. It really inspired me to expand my knowledge of music and it points out how many different kinds of music there are and how important music is in pretty much everyone's life.<br />Lastly, I would like to mention how this novel also brought me thinking about my life and what's really important in life and how much we should all appreciate the people who we are close with.<br />All in all this novel really touched my heart and it is just so special that I would tell anyone who hasn't read it yet to do so now. Come on. Go. Get it. Now.

0316187216|4.0|Red Country is Joe Abercrombie's latest.  A fusion of his grim, gritty and cynical fantasy writing and a lifetime of watching afternoon matinee westerns.<br /><br />Some might struggle with the concept, perhaps short swords and stetsons sounds a bit off key. But, hey, it is possible to fuse disparate genres - Whedon did it with Firefly and I'm inclined to think that Abercrombie has done the same in Red Country.<br /><br />There's a noticeable absence of firearms in the book and I'm pretty sure there aren't any stetsons, but the story is packed full of tropes even the casual viewer or reader of the western genre will pick up on.<br /><br />From evil marauding outlaws, to long, wagon laden convoys across vast plains.  There's people searching for gold, a new life or both in the Far Country free from the trials and tribulations of living in the Union - free to build a better version of themselves or to hide the old one.<br /><br />Regular readers of Abercrombie will know that the man has a preference for more modern dialogue. There's a quite noticeable absence of archaic patterns of speech one might expect in Tolkien and a hell of a lot more cussin'. Red Country is presented in the same vein, with perhaps a slightly altered register and exposition that's in keeping with the western mode.<br /><br />\\"Folk had swarmed to the bridge like flies to a midden, sucked in from across the wild and windy country to trade and drink, fight and f***, laugh and cry and do whatever else folk did when they found themselves with company after weeks or months or even years without.\\"<br /><br />Again regular readers will know that aside from the fast, \\"in your face\\" violence, Abercrombie is known for his dark, dry wit and Red Country doesn't disappoint.  There's a number of exchanges between characters that had me in mind of some of the finer episodes of Deadwood. Not that I am saying that Abercrombie mimics the syntax and English usage in Deadwood but that the two share a similarity of rhythm in the verbal repartee between characters.<br /><br />Oh and the swearing as well.<br /><br />The other feature that struck me with Red Country is that Abercrombie's world changes.  There's progress from the time of The Blade Itself to this point.  There's change  wrought by the demographic displacement of the gold rush and by the gradual development of industry.  By the end of Red Country we see the arrival of steam for instance.<br /><br />In that sense Abercrombie's work, and Red Country continues this, is progressive and realistic, there's little pining for the loss of the status quo. I thoroughly enjoyed the work, felt it straddled both genres well, it was Joe Abercrombie's western infused fantasy not Joe Abercrombie trying to write a western.<br /><br />You needn't have read Abercrombie's other works, this works very well on its own.<br /><br />This book was provided by the publisher at no cost to my good person.hythm in the verbal repartee between characters.<br /><br />Oh and the swearing as well.<br /><br />The other feature that struck me with Red Country is that Abercrombie's world changes.

B007SGM084|5.0|I got this trilogy as a suggestion from my daughter in law telling me it was HOT! No disappointments there!  The author really knows how to go into depth with the characters never a dull moment. I would highly recommend this to anyone unless they do not enjoy sexual reads as it is BIG on sex. A total different sexual preference  for most of us so it makes it exciting to read about alternate choices. It is also a great read for anyone who likes a psychological twist into the mix. I had to read it twice as I do that when I enjoy a book as I always find something I missed. Looking forward to any new releases from this author as after just a small way into the book she makes you so acquainted with the characters it is easy to get engrossed
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Interesting story line with significant detail.  Timelines were well put together to keep the interest.  Some wrong arithmetic when Malcolm was selling the 5 gold bars.  The $122,000 equates to 10 bars, not 5.  Minor point. Enjoyable reading.

B000O8OTNC|2.0|This product keeps my knife as sharp as it could be. The only problems I have with it is the size, which is too small for my big hands as well as the diamond encrusted sharpening rod which could've been a bit thicker and longer in my opinion. Also, whenever I received it, it looked like the package had been sitting on a shelf for about five years. The carbide blades looked tarnished as well. Other than these small inconveniences, this sharpener does what it says it does. Sharpens knives.<br /><br />EDIT: Not really digging the product now. It seems that the sharpening blades dull over a matter of DAYS so it really doesn't get my knife that sharp.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Prometheus is an excellent movie but i still have questions about who some of the characters are and why they are doing whatever they're doing. Right from the start it almost makes sense but not quite. The monster keeps evolving and changing it's nature. Once again we have the partly evil robot who is also partly good and we get into this whole creation thing..........\\"why did your Maker make you?\\" and the answer is: \\"because they could'. I'm wondering if the intent is to eventually portray us as the progeny of the \\"bad\\" alien as opposed to the \\"good\\" Engineers who did the bio-engineering. Then the story gets lost in the final battle, if it's supposed to be a setup for the wrecked (Engineer alien) ship crash found on LV421 featured in \\"Alien\\" and \\"Aliens\\" it misses the mark because the wreck is totally different from the wreckage found in the earlier movies. Then there are the canisters taking the place of the eggs, the three atmosphere converters already built, i don't want to give any spoilers but this movie goes out of it's way to tell us that it takes place on LV421. I dunno, i've watched it five or six times and if anything i'm even more confused than when i started. So i guess it's a baited hook to get me into the next movie.........

B003HN7BYA|5.0|C F H, album is great, the live & demo is cool recording, just when Pantera's music career taking off as the Nu Metal scene. Revamped & held the flag of metal during the commercial of the grunge scene in the main music & movie streams.<br />Recording demo & live does speak for itself, hard working crew, when they were fresh & new for its time. Enjoy.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This book was in my kindle, and I don't know how it got there.  I don't recall purchasing it at all.  So I clicked it open to see what it was.  Hours later, I was dragging myself into work bleary eyed and sleepless.<br /><br />Where did this guy come from?  Sorry Mr. Ryan, but I had not heard of you.  I will try to remedy that situation for others.<br /><br />What a great fantasy novel.  I like books about people.  Elves and dwarves and all that can be fun, but they are almost never able to be taken seriously enough, really.  This is people.  People being people.  People being devious, broken, fearful, and courageous.  There is magic, and just the right amount.  No one denies it but it is rarely encountered, except in great tales of mighty heroes and/or villains - like this one.<br /><br />I won't offer spoilers, just tell you about it's about a warrior monk who is devoted to his faith but must answer to his king.  I love the protagonist's unapologetic approach to life; although he feels much remorse, he is pragmatic about the necessity of his actions.<br /><br />His tale involves faith, intrigue, romance, and of course conflict in a world that is fully rendered and fully believable.  The world's history and hierarchies aren't explained in monotonous paragraphs, but are revealed as we travel with the brothers through adventure and dialog.  As Vaelin grows, so does his world and our knowledge of it.<br /><br />I'll stop rambling.  I am a pretty tough critic; even books that I love often get less than five stars for one reason or another, but this one gets all five.  I can't recommend it highly enough.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|As good as it gets; great story line, thought provoking material and plenty of action brought home by an exceptionally gifted writer. As characters, Katniss and Peeta are gems each in their own right and will not be forgotten anytime soon.  Move over heros of old and more recent times, a new dynamic duo is now ruling the shelves.
0374214913|5.0|This novel is a true winner. Many other reviewers have summarized the plot, so I won't repeat it here. The key to this great story is that Robin Sloan is a great storyteller. He creates characters who are likeable, even loveable, real and engaging. The elements of a good story are all here, with a pair of young lovers on an adventure, a mysterious bookstore, strange customers, and a clerk who works the night shift at the titular bookstore, who has been forbidden to look at the books. How could he not look at the books? Mr. Sloan's first novel is both fun and full of ideas, fast paced and thoughtful. He works in literature, science fiction, fantasy, and computer geek stuff without overloading the story. I spent an enjoyable several hours in the company of this book.<br /><br />I found this book because Amazon's editors chose it as one of the best of the month, and the description appealed to me. I have chosen some real losers that way, but I keep trying, because one winner like this novel can make up for all the books I didn't even finish. I am sure that there are people out there who won't like it, particularly those who dislike computers and role playing games, but it is so good that I am recommending it to almost (not my mom) everyone
B000URWYTS|4.0|I have been a fan of Frank Lloyd Wright since I studied Art History at school.  This story gives a human dimension to the artist. I realize it is a work of fiction, but I found it believable and very well put together. Well written and altogether a very enjoyable read.

B005LAJ17M|5.0|My wife and I watched the first season of Homeland and couldn't wait until the next week for it to come on again. That's why we purchased the first season and will also buy the next season and however many there will be as long as it continues on the same vein - we're currently watching this year's Homeland (season two). When you find a program that's coincides with what's happening today and is outstanding, you want to have your own Blue Ray copy.
B006OGMEUI|4.0|The new c.d from Eluveitie can be summed up in one word. Different. This was the first c.d I bought from them. I usually find a band on Amazon look them up on youtube then buy the c.d. I was not disappointed when I bought this. From hearing the song \\"A Rose for Epona\\" you hear a woman beautifully singing with Heavy Metal in the back ground. Now she isn't the singer all the way through. I didn't know that when I bought this. The main singer is a screamer which I can appreciate I enjoy death and thrash metal as well.<br />About 85% is screaming and the rest is her singing. It's electrifying and just fun to listen to. How many other times can you say that you listened to a guitar solo with a flute and a hurdy gurdy in the back ground. If you say a lot than good for you.
B004Q3SGWG|1.0|This movie, to me, was about as exciting as watching grass grow. I rate it as equal as' Cast away', boring. The movie trailers looked interesting, but I guess don't judge a book by it's cover. Or, don't judge a movie by its trailer. hahaha!

B0041KVW2K|5.0|I got my set yesterday and it was packed well, boy was it packed well! It was inside of a large box, but was suspended in heavy die cut foam that surrounded the whole set. In addition, there was foam packed inside of the set itself keeping the contents from banging around during shipping. So far, the quality of the pressings has been superior, even Abbey Road, which I put on immediately after reading some of the reviews. I haven't had the chance to listen to every record yet, but so far the seven or so that I have have played have been flawless.    The included book is done with meticulous attention to detail, and is truly quality work. I have many books on many musicians, as well as some very expensive art books, and this ranks among the best that I've seen.    As far as the audiophile nitpicking: I am a true analog purist to the core. There are a lot of complaints about this being cut from the digital remasters. Even being a purist, I say, phooey! The initial recordings are analog, thereby eliminating a great deal of the brittleness that is a result of utilizing the digital process all the way through. Even the most trained ears cannot identify the difference between the MFSL versions, and these. It's all a matter of personal mix preference in the end. I have a few mint vinyl originals myself, and am hard pressed to detect a QUALITY difference between the new and the old. The new EQ is obvious in some cases, but even that was done through a vintage EMI EQ to maintain integrity. For those who are interested there is an excellent article in the Chicago Tribune ( [...] ) which conducted a \\"shootout\\" between the new versions, the original versions, and the MFSL versions involving a well versed panel of listeners. A good read for anyone interested in this set.    In short, the artwork and inserts are beautiful, the mastering has been carefully and thoughtfully done, and the quality is as good if not better than some of the originals/german pressings/japanese pressingsthat I have. If you are both a Beatles and a vinyl fan, get this, you will not be sorry.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I'm sure the author experienced something and went through what was certainly an ordeal and an improbable recovery, but this was a unique experience and nothing more.  As the Dr. says, no two NDEs are alike, which is evidence that this is more like a dream than a heavenly experience.  My baloney meter kept going off starting at chapter 15 and the book really fell apart.  The best part of the book is the author's recollection of his experience  of meeting his birth family after many years of rejection.  I too was adopted but never pursued my birth family. I was touched by that tender recounting.  It's too bad the author had such a mediocre Christian experience before this event in his life, or he would never have dared to call this Proof of Heaven.
B005F96URI|4.0|This movie is mostly like a comic. It has great imagery. The action in the movie is brutal and demands huge amounts of talent in Martial Arts. Also, I like the cast.
B00913DPW2|4.0|Prepare to be frustrated. The game is great, but VERY challenging.  Many difficult puzzles reminiscent of the old PC game, 7th guest.  YOU WILL HAVE TO CHEAT!  I normally never cheat on games but I ended up having to do so guilt free on this one.  Even with the in-game clues, it was that hard.<br /><br />Unfortunately, part of the difficulty is that I think this game was meant for a tablet as some of the items you need to touch to advance are so tiny and easy to miss on a cellphone. Even when you do see them, the exact spot you have to touch is so small that you have to touch many times for it to work. That is the only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5. These frustrating details completely replaced the otherwise spooky atmosphere.  Recommended.

0743297334|3.0|I think this is my fourth or fifth time to read this novel, and each time I read it I had an entirely different impression. In high school, the group of expatriates visiting Spain seemed glamorous and tragic, the dialog hard to follow.<br /><br />Now I see the book more as having historical significance. Hemingway captured \\"The Lost Generation\\" in these pages. His use of terse, journalistic prose was revolutionary. However, with age, the characters drunken escapades seem pathetic and juvenile rather that funny and glamorous. I feel certain this will be my last time to read it.... I'm too old for this crap.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Truly awesome book and so enlightened. It gave me alot of insight from my past to present. I have so enjoyed that I have purchased for friends and shared with them.
B001FOPODS|5.0|The claymation was, strictly speaking, just incredible.  The story was fresh and alive, and also very close to the original given that this one takes place in the modern day.  The mood is set during the first five minutes of the piece, and Prokofiev's music doesn't begin until Petr opens the gate to what seems to be held as \\"the wild\\", which is wonderful in that it is so much nicer than the world Petr knows.  The music begins at this point and shows the wonder that Petr feels when he steps into the frontier that he's been forbidden to experience.  All in all, a great work.  If only all remakes/retellings could be this good.<br /><br />Umm, spoiler alert:<br />Petr has a hard lesson to learn during this story.  It's a lesson that I've been slowly introducing to my young ones as they get bigger.  There are a lot of scary things out there in the world, but a hungry wolf in winter is still not as scary as an ignorant human with a gun.  The wolf is doing what it needs to stay alive, whereas humans that do terrible things rarely have anywhere near as good a reason, and unfortunately there are far more of the latter.  I was surprised but happy that this Petr showed compassion and understanding.  I didn't see forgiveness or contrition in either of their eyes, but I did seem to see some shared understanding, though that could just be because of how late it is... YMMV

If you haven't read this already you HAVE to get it!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Very well-written and well-acted new series. One of the best new series in many years. The New York setting works well for a Sherlock series.
B005JE1JZC|5.0|Awesome! The Fool is my ultimate favourite character. He adds mystery and action to the books. Once again. I cannot even begin to string a sentence together that would say how BRILLIANT Hobb and her characters are. It is un-bloody-believeable!! Just know that Robin Hobb and her books, so far, are amazing!
B00633W614|3.0|nothing much to expect on this sequel and the ending - i didn't know that it's already ended, maybe  because there's another book after this.<br />the first book is still the best .

B007KOYEOC|4.0|A good read, well wriiten as are the earlier two books. One the minus side, a few details were skipped over that the end by the author. On the plus side, I liked the section of the end telling of the first meetings from book 1 from Christian's perspective.
B0025KW29U|4.0|Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog, based on originality, creativity, and most of all irony came together to create a very innovated musical. Creating each character to portray such specific traits formed a unique take of the whole musical. Throughout the full 42 minutes, the attention grabbing events and ironic themes produced overall a musical that can be anticipated to be watched over again and again.<br /> The characters present in this musical all played an extremely important role with regards to personality traits that developed great chemistry. In the beginning, Dr. Horrible is exposed as an evil scientist, with his main purpose to join the Evil League of Evil. Yet, we see his transformation when he begins falling for an innocent young woman, Penny. This struggle between good and evil is convincingly shown throughout the entirety of this musical. Another character, Captain Hammer brings in a bit of humor and is quite different from most heroes. His personality is far from being humble, and his lack of care for anyone but his self is evident several times. The battle between Captain Hammer and Dr. Horrible is originally because one is a hero and the other is a villain, yet their dislike for one another only increases after Penny was brought into the story. The creative mix of relationships created an exciting and suspenseful film.<br /> The use of irony between the characters and also even in the plot gave this a unique twist unlike most movies. In comparison to the majority of heroes played in films, Captain Hammer was portrayed in a non-heroic light. In a way, he was \\"good\\", and did \\"save\\" Penny from danger, but his motives were completely for himself.. In the same way, Dr. Horrible was shown as the villain, and although he was plotting evil schemes, his true nature was kind and considerate. This switch in character traits gave a different take of traditional hero and villain films.<br /> Another dramatic twist was the death of Penny.  Not only was Penny shot by Captain Hammer but she passed away because of it. This was a great example of the unexpected nature of this film. Penny, the love of Dr. Horrible's life was killed by his number one enemy, on accident. The irony that Dr. Horrible tried to get everything he wanted by killing Captain Hammer, but ended up losing everything when he lost Penny teaches a lesson that can be applied to anything.<br /> The catchy songs, use of humor, and unexpected ending created an enjoyable musical not like most films. The use of characters to manipulate each other caused another unique aspect that is hard to find. After you watch this once, Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog will most defiantly be on your mind.

The president may have given some speeches about the ownership society, but there is little evidence that banks snap to it when the president gives a speech.\\" (Pg. 10)<br /><br />He criticizes the Obama administration, which was \\"directing most of its efforts at rescuing the banks... the way it designed the bank bailouts hampered mortgage restructuring, failed to restart lending---the alleged objective of the bank bailout---and has left the country with a much larger national debt than it alternative approaches had been taken.\\" (Pg. 108) He argues that bailouts \\"do exactly the opposite of what should be done: enforcing appropriate discipline on the banks, rewarding those that had been prudent, and letting fail those that had takenk extraordinary risk.\\" (Pg. 135)<br /><br />He argues that derivatives \\"shouldn't be banned, but they should be regulated to make sure that they are used appropriately.\\" (Pg. 174) He concludes, \\"incomes of most Americans have stagnated or fallen...

B009AZZEU2|5.0|I am so happy that Soundgarden got back together and recorded when they felt it was time.  The music on this record comes across as true to the spirit of Soundgarden's past, but it is flavored with relevant sounds that show the trajectory of Soundgarden's future!  Fans of Superunknown and Down on the Upside will be very happy as this album seems grounded in the middle of those two sonically and lyrically.  There are a few nods to Badmotorfinger here and there, but they are done in a mature fashion.  Where a young adolescent band excels in brandishing the young innocent hormones raging across early recordings, a mature band has the time tested experience of years of touring and recording.  This album seems to really tap into both feelings quite well.  You get the old sound that a fan would want to hear.  You get the well written songs of experienced musicians, but they have tapped into that love of music that started on their path in teenage years.<br /><br />Chris Cornell's voice is one that cannot be matched in today's musical landscape.  He has the power, emotion and range to scream, croon and serenade with any of the greats.  Kim Thayil's return to guitar is refreshing.  He always played in the cracks as it were.  He did things differently when approaching the guitar.  Creating a landscape, slicing angular riffs or hammering a groove...he always designed guitar parts that interested me.  When you combine the abilities of Cornell and Thayil with the drumming of Matt Cameron and monstrous thunder of Ben Sheppard's bass it really is a blend of four musicians who gel in a way that makes the whole band rise above others.  Cameron's perfect timing and groove is so reliable that he is largely underrated.  Sheppard's bass playing lays a foundation that augments the percussion while adding to the low end harmoniously.<br /><br />Sometimes I do a quick track to track analysis, but I don't think I can do that justice in a review here on Amazon.  I think I would have to refer to a thesaurus every sentence to evoke the emotions that flood over me when I listen to an album like the one created here.  Soundgarden have returned with an album that will, undoubtedly, rise to a ranking above many others.  It will go down in history as one worthy of any Rock & Roll Hall of Fame honor they will deserve.  Any Grammy Award that they will be nominated for will not properly acknowledge the work that they have done over their career.  They are on my short list of truly amazing artists.r to a thesaurus every sentence to evoke the emotions that flood over me when I listen to an album like the one created here.

B0016BP0PW|5.0|This is a great movie and a must for Beatles fans.  The songs weave beautifully  into this magical musical.  Love it!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|The Good:<br />This movie is full to bursting of very good (and good looking) actors and actresses. Idris Elba, Noomi Rapace (who looks amazingly fit!), Charlize Theron, Michael Fassbender and Logan-Michael Green are really always a joy to watch perform. I particularly enjoyed Idris Elba's kind of hayseed captain character, and the too brief scene near the end of the film with him and Noomi Rapace is one of my favorites.<br /><br />The special effects and scene modelling are good.<br /><br />There's some really decent action in this movie near the end.<br /><br />The Not so good:<br />From a science perspective this movie was hilarious. I'll not rehash the premise as other reviewers have done. What struck me was that these were absolutely some of the silliest scientists you will ever see in a film. Here are some highlights:<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />Taking off your protective gear and breathing strange air on an alien planet you just arrived at<br />Hooking up a dead alien head (outside of a hood no less) with unidentified cells growing on it to electrical currents until it explodes<br />Deciding to settle down for the evening in the room filled with unidentified black viscous goo<br />Reaching your hand out to a hissing serpent like alien life form<br /> The angry geologist with the nifty mapping tools was the first one to get lost<br /><br />* End Spoilers*<br /><br />I know this isn't meant to be a comedy, but as someone who has worked in a variety of science fields (including environmental science), I laughed a lot. Just wow- everything a scientists is trained not to do they did.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />As an Alien series fan, this is still an entertaining watch. It's interesting enough to keep you on the hook for the next installment. Watch it, enjoy the good performances, the beautiful people, and just shake your head at the science.
B0053JJLLC|3.0|This book followed the classic Crichton formula: Introduce new & interesting technology, throw in some human greed and conflict, which puts the good guys in a scary position.  Evetually, while encountering more scientific wonder, the hero(es) work out how to survive, and in the process the bad guy gets it in the end.  Predictable? Sure, but still a fun ride. And only predictable from the standpoint of that framework.  The details are all interesting to read while at the same time furthering the plot. The micro world is presented as both beautiful and deadly.  One encounter with a hornet literally had me on edge while reading (and I am usually quite jaded).
B008764ZQ4|5.0|There was much negativity surrounding this film. I will say this:  The cast did a FANTASTIC job on this film and the soundtrack is proof of it!!  The biggest surprise was the duet with Tom Cruise and Malin Akerman.  When I heard it, I was stunned at how moving and beautiful it was!  Russell Brand and Catherine Zeta-Jones in their duet were just as awesome!!!  For those who really dig 80's rock, this cast did it justice!!!

B007O3QC8K|4.0|Although I think the William Carragan completion as performed on the Chandos recording of the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra led by Yoav Talmi is closer to the joyous, glorious finales that Bruckner composed for the 5th and 8th symphonies, this version has a lot to commend itself.  It feels like it belongs with the rest of the symphony and is a fitting conclusion.  That it comes on a single disc is a welcome bonus.  Still, one could argue that like Schubert's Unfinished symphony, this symphony needs no completion.  Yet, it is worthwhile to hear what Bruckner might have done had he lived longer.  I recommend this recording.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I would actually give this 4.5 stars if I could, because it wasn't as original or concise as I would ideally like, but I did thoroughly enjoy reading this book despite those minor issues. It is quite similar to Twilight, in its concept of what a vampire is and does, but it is much much more interesting as far as the entire story line of each goes. It is extremely well written, but it is a little more of a character-driven piece than a plot-driven piece which makes it a slower pace especially given the length of the book. I wouldn't go so far as to say it's a fantasy book for brainiacs as other reviewers have suggested, simply a higher quality witch/vampire fantasy than most out there... sort of like a mixture of Twilight and Harry Potter for adults. If you liked either of those, you will like this too.

B005LAJ1O0|3.0|'American Horror Story' (2011) is an innovative series created by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk for FX, and one which further evolves the post-modern television thriller, a process which began with David Lynch's influential 'Twin Peaks' (1990-1991) and continued with Chris Carter's more commercially successful 'The X-Files' (1993-2002).<br /><br />Murphy and Falchuk clearly intend 'American Horror Story' to be as visually and narratively extreme as a program can possibly be for the current market, and so it comes as no surprise that the show does not air on the Fox channel itself.<br /><br />The plot has Ben (Dylan McDermott) and Vivienne (Connie Britton) Harmon and their teenage daughter Violet (Taissa Farmiga) moving from Boston to Los Angeles after Ben is caught in an adulterous affair with a young woman. The family buys a sprawling old mansion built in the 1920s, and Ben, a psychiatrist, sets about reestablishing his practice.<br /><br />Almost immediately, bizarre events begin to take place in and around the house. The Harmons also discover that their next door neighbor, Constance (Jessica Lange), is an intrusive, insistent, and increasingly threatening presence in their lives.<br /><br />Since Vivienne no longer trusts Ben, the couple finds coping with their impossible experiences difficult and isolating, while Violet, who is bullied at her new school, secretly begins a relationship with young Tate (Evan Peters), one of her father's troubled patients.<br /><br />'American Horror Story' certainly has an overall style of its own, and it becomes almost immediately clear to the viewer that the creators intend to heap an absolute maximum  superabundance of 'paranormal' events on the Harmons and on the audience. The Val Lewton-Jacques Tourneur \\"less is more\\" style of horror, seen in such classics as 'Cat People' (1941) and 'I Walked With A Zombie' (1942), is clearly not a style admired by Murphy and Falchuk.<br /><br />While the dominant 'supernatural' presence is a male figure in a zippered, head-to-toe black rubber body suit, there are also a pair of twin boys who have been murdered, a hideous dwarfish monster in the basement, a succubus of a housemaid who appears elderly to Vivienne but young and attractive to Ben, a pair of dead nurses, a 'mad doctor' and his anguished wife, the ghosts of two male homosexuals who believe the mansion still belongs to them, a horribly-scarred man who claims to have killed his own family, the spirit of Elizabeth Short, and others.<br /><br />And why is Vivienne's new pregnancy causing such alarm?<br /><br />'American Horror Story' offers not '13 Ghosts,' but seemingly 113 or more.<br /><br />As a result of this barrage of what are essentially old-fashioned monsters in newfangled  dress, 'American Horror Story,' while remaining interesting, becomes increasingly less suspenseful with each episode; the sense of objective reality is increasingly diminished, making it less and less possible to believe that Ben, Vivienne, and Violet are actually alive and existing in an ostensible 'real world' shared with the audience.<br /><br />While many previous films (of some ninety minutes or thereabouts) have utilized such a veiled technique to great effect, here, viewers of 'American Horror Story,' which is some five hundred minutes in length, are likely to simply stop caring whether the proceedings are actual, illusory, supernatural, or some combination of these. As in 'Lost' (2004-2010), answers to mysteries are often either too long in coming, only partial when finally revealed, or simply not addressed at all. It's an exhausting process.<br /><br />Viewers will easily recognize homages and references to older horror films throughout the series, from Whale's 'The Old Dark House' (1932), Polanski's 'Rosemary's Baby' (1968), Roeg's 'Don't Look Now' (1973), Curtis' 'Burnt Offerings' (1976) Kubrick's 'The Shining' (1980) and Fulci's 'The House By the Cemetery' (1981) to Argento's 'Phenomena' (1985) and Amenabar's 'The Others' (2001), as well as the marked influence of David Lynch, Robert Mapplethorpe, and Nancy Grossman.  <br /><br />To their credit, Murphy and Falchuk (here and in season two, 'American Horror Story: Asylum,' 2012, which begins an entirely new narrative) actually root the source of their horrors in actualities like Nazism and all it entailed, necrophilia, genetic deformity, psychosis, serial murder, disfiguring scars, sadomasochism, limb amputation, self-mutilation, sexual pathology and perversion, abortion (dead babies, the severed limbs of children, and deformed offspring are everywhere in 'American Horror Story'), Draconian laws, personal betrayal and other fear-inducing elements of life; it is these  'actualities,' possible in everyone's life, that give the show its weird, gruesome, and often unpleasant power.<br /><br />Boris Karloff once said that he preferred 'terror films' to 'horror films,' as the latter were, in his opinion, largely designed to disgust and revolt rather than frighten. Karloff, then, wouldn't have appreciated 'American Horror Story,' which, in addition to bald sexuality, straddles both 'terror' and 'horror' and pushes the proverbial envelope to its absolute currently-accepted limit.r's 'The Others' (2001), as well as the marked influence of David Lynch, Robert Mapplethorpe, and Nancy Grossman.  <br /><br />To their credit, Murphy and Falchuk (here and in season two, 'American Horror Story: Asylum,' 2012, which begins an entirely new narrative) actually root the source of their horrors in actualities like Nazism and all it entailed, necrophilia, genetic deformity, psychosis, serial murder, disfiguring scars, sadomasochism, limb amputation, self-mutilation, sexual pathology and perversion, abortion (dead babies, the severed limbs of children, and deformed offspring are everywhere in 'American Horror Story'), Draconian laws, personal betrayal and other fear-inducing elements of life; it is these  'actualities,' possible in everyone's life, that give the show its weird, gruesome, and often unpleasant power.<br /><br />Boris Karloff once said that he preferred 'terror films' to 'horror films,' as the latter were, in his opinion, largely designed to disgust and revolt rather than frighten.

B007IQWQ88|5.0|This is an astounding box set of sets-- with all the CDs in mini-LP jackets AND with the Originals label too. It is actually volume one (hopefully), and I hope they continue with Karajan 1970s. So he did not get around to everything essential in this box-- Mozart's last great symphonies, Strauss' Also Sprach Zarathustra, etc. Also, most of these records are not maxed to 70 minutes-- only a few are, those which were already reformatted for the Originals series, etc. The highlight for me was the two CDs of Johann Strauss, without a doubt my finest two disc set of Strauss waltzes (the second disc was maxed for the Originals series), and featuring the actual original track of Blue Danube that Kubrick used in 2001. Believe it or not, I actually got a magnifying glass and read every single sleeve note on the backs of all 82 of these albums!
0375842209|5.0|I can't recommend this book enough.  I was profoundly touched by it.  I feel like a lot of the time these WWII stories always come from the Jewish perspective, which is fine because they were obviously the victims. But for me, I felt like seeing what the Germans themselves went through was very interesting to me.  I don't think I realized how much they suffered as well.  I have to admit that I cried many times.  It was so beautiful that I can't express in words how I felt.  I thank the author for writing this story.  I can't stop thinking about it and haven't been able to pick up another book just because I'm afraid of losing what I have just experienced.

030758836X|1.0|I wish I could give this book no stars! It appears at first to be intelligently written ...oh, wait, no, apparently the author has a very limited vocabulary, because she reverts to vulgar language on a regular basis! The story is interesting enough, but because of the profanity I quickly found  myself reading just to see how it ended. Just to be met with that, \\"I can't believe I read the whole thing for this!\\" feeling. It's a John Grisham anti-climax; Grisham with a potty mouth.  Amazon should have a rating system for books - Rated R for Language. This is my first time reading this author, and definitely my last!
0375869026|1.0|The author might have considered that bullied youth with an intellectual or developmental disability, and their families and friends, will read the book, expecting it to be empathetic. Instead  they will find that apparently it is still okay to use the words \\"retard, moron and imbecile\\". It is especially disappointing and hurtful to find this in a book from an author claiming to encourage kindness and compassion. Indeed, for the majority of the book, the author, R.J. Palacio, tells the story exceptionally well of a young boy living with a facial deformity, and the impact his unusual appearance has on himself, his family, friends, strangers and community.<br /><br />Through her story and Amazon author interview video, she encourages the reader to consider the impact of insensitivity and unkindness on August. Yet, in her writing, she has no problem with using the terms \\"moron, imbecile and retard\\" to describe the bullies who threaten Auggie. All three words are descriptors used to comfort Auggie that the 7th grade bullies are low lifes. Apparently the author is okay with \\"morons, imbeciles and retards\\" as terms that can be used as insults, yet all three descriptors are standard, old school clinical terms used to describe children and adults who have a lower than average IQ. A low IQ is just as much a stroke of fate, a chromosomal and genetic condition as random as Auggie's facial abnormality. The terms moron, imbecile and retard have their origin as clinical terms, but are now used by the general public and the author as though they have no impact or meaning. I doubt she meant to imply that people with low IQ's are any less human than Auggie (or me or you), but the terms are as hurtful and hateful a slur against anyone whose IQ is not average as anything Auggie's tormentors come up with in the book - just Google the \\"Campaign to end the R word\\" if you want more information from youth who have been bullied and tormented by the free use of those words as insults.<br /><br />We aren't all born with an average or high IQ, just like we aren't all born good looking.  Some of us are born with an IQ as exceptionally low as Auggie's physical appearance is unusual. Yet, as the author makes clear, all of us want and need love, belonging, friendship, and opportunities to shine for our standing ovation. Given the sensitivity portrayed throughout the rest of the book, I trust the author did not intend to be hurtful, but as she says in one passage, you don't have to intend to be hurtful on purpose for it to hurt. Perhaps the author and readers will stop using the terms, and consider the youth with Down Syndrome or other disabilities likely to include an intellectual disability will read the book and be just as hurt and disappointed as Auggie.br />We aren't all born with an average or high IQ, just like we aren't all born good looking.

0385335997|2.0|OK, enough now. I cannot believe this is only the 3rd installment of the series, with 5 more to go. This book was dreadful, downright embarrassing. A person I admire very much, who is a published author, told me this is the best series ever written.<br /><br />I enjoy historical fiction books because they represent a time and place in history, often focused around specific events (i.e., The Siege of Leningrad, etc.). The first book of this series is somewhat centered around Scotland's battle with the British in 1745. I learned some things from the first book, and it inspired me to research the topic more thoroughly.<br /><br />I didn't like the second book, but was told to get through it because #3 is so great. I have to stop listening to people. This was an 1100 page soap opera, complete with events so far fetched, it is insulting to the reader. I do not get the allure of Jamie. He is a big thug who can't do anything above board. He is a criminal, and never stops his behavior. We are supposed to like him because he says sweet things to Claire in a Scottish accent? Claire is no better. I didn't really like her in the 1st book, but she was tolerable. However, listening to her ramble on for 1100 pages is painful. Why couldn't the book be more real? Why were so many unbelievable events put into the book? Could the author have cut the book in half, and left out all of those ridiculous events that just seem to magically happen? This is it for me. Good bye Claire and Jamie. I hope to never hear your names again.
B001O22ELQ|4.0|In \\"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog,\\" directed by Joss Whedon, Dr. Horrible is a villain who wants to be a part of the League of Evil, led by Bad Horse. Bad Horse puts Dr. Horrible to the test to see if he can make it into the Evil League, by telling him that he has to plan something evil and the League will be watching. The only things standing in Dr. Horrible's way are his arch nemesis Captain Hammer and his love interest Penny.<br /> Dr. Horrible tries so hard to be a villain, but from the first scene with Penny, viewers see that Dr. Horrible does have a lot of good in him. Dr. Horrible comes off as innocent while attempting to talk to his crush, Penny, at the laundry mat. Most evil villains do not come off as innocent no matter who they are speaking to. From the first scene with Captain Hammer, viewers see that, even though he is supposed to be the hero, that he is not true of heart. Captain Hammer is cocky and does what is necessary to make himself look good. In the first \\"heroic\\" scene from Captain Hammer, he breaks Dr. Horrible's controls on a van, making it drive with no one directing it, and even though Dr. Horrible is the one who stops the van from driving and killing Penny, Captain Hammer claims to have stopped the van and saved the day. Captain Hammer shows another non-heroic side of him when he tells Dr. Horrible that he is going to sleep with Penny, just because he knows that Dr. Horrible wants her.<br /> In the end, Dr. Horrible plans to kill Captain Hammer with his death ray to get into the League of Evil. Like always, Dr. Horrible's plans go awry with a very shocking and unexpected ending. This change of events made it possible for Dr. Horrible to get into the League of Evil, but at an awful cost. The final series of events also changed Dr. Horrible to become truly evil.<br /> Personally, I found this film entertaining. It was filled with witty and extremely corny humor. The film was filled with amazing actors who did an excellent job. I would recommend this movie to any of my friends or family members who wanted to get a good laugh out of a short film.

When you listen to a Vaccines record it is very difficult to pay attention to anything else. This is especially true with this album.  Come of Age is in no way shape or form background music. The energy from these songs are, like I said before, utterly consuming. Enjoy this album, and enjoy it good! Check out their tiger blood EP also if you haven't already. It's brilliant.
B007REV4T8|5.0|\\"Skyfall\\" is the latest James Bond movie, marking 50 years of the 007 franchise, which shows no signs of running out of gas.  The movie manages to be something different while still honoring the traditions of the series.  It has a plot with substance, built around a plausible and deadly threat to MI6, that plays out in an entirely serious manner, with the self-referential jokes kept to a minimum.  One leading character has to earn a way in; another is on the way out.<br /><br />The movie offers themes of resurrection and renewal.  Bond goes missing in action after an assignment in Turkey goes badly, only to resurface when MI6 comes under attack.  \\"M\\" will be under immense pressure to resign after a major security compromise; she elects to stick it out to the bitter end.  An old enemy of the service turns out to have a complicated and conflicted backstory, and a very modern weapon.  Old-school violence turns out to be the solution to a 21st century problem...<br /><br />Daniel Craig is on his third and best outing as Bond.  Judi Dench returns as \\"M\\".  Javier Bardem is a very talented actor, but his villain is rather overplayed.  Natalie Harris is Bond's partner in the field, a role with conflicted loyalties.  Ralph Fiennes is Gareth Mallory, the stuffy liaison to Parliament, with some surprises up his sleeve.  The movie digs deep into Bond's past for its final dramatic setting in Scotland.  The action sequences are on a more human scale, and more believable and frightening for it.  Highly recommended.
B000XEIVG8|5.0|Live After Death consists some of Iron Maiden's best live recorded tracks ever. Each track has been played with unique and distinctive styles from each musician to which it cannot be replicated even in the studio recordings. The live song playlist was well organized. I especially like the beginning title as Churchill's Speech followed immediately by Aces High, consider one of Iron Maiden's best written and catchiest songs among fans.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think the creators of minecraft should put a bunch of mods on the market and sell them they would be a great money maker and all. but this is by far the best app I have played in a long time but if you could buy mods on the market and they down load to the original minecraft game there would be a lot more to do. the only problem with mine craft pe is that there isn't a lot to do. if there where more caves and easily accessable realms than it would be more fun. hope this helps and hope there are updates soon. thank you
0743496736|5.0|This book is so well written and keeps you on your feet. If you love suspense, this is the book for you! I recommend this book to anyone who loves to read exciting books that always keep you guessing.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Great game, I played it for for an hour or so and I loved it kept me entertained for a long time.  Easy to play,
B0091REZMW|5.0|pretty good game, wish I wouldn't have wasted my diamonds so quickly.  the only thing I don't like is running out of energy
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I love it! This game is EPIC! I don't know what else to say the game is just mind blowing and has an excellent soundtrack. this game reminds me a little bit of Skyrim
B005DTEUAE|5.0|I'm with You debuts with Guitarist Josh. Almost every song has a different guitar approach than John's approach as in a more funky and poppy style. Nevertheless, it is still a great album and approachable to RHCP's fans.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|I got this game free because it was for the app of the day but I think $3 for it is reasonable. Other people say $.99 but I think that's too low for the people who put that much time and effort into making this whimsical game. I love puzzle games but most of the time, puzzle games aren't the most well designed with something cute and fun like this one. For some reason, making a cartoon jellyfish fly around wearing hats makes it both silly and uber appealing to not just the young, but any age that likes to laugh while using their noggin! Thanks!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I read all three books in less than a week. Obsessed is putting it mildly! Make sure you clear your week before starting this trilogy because you will not want to put them down. I definitely recommend reading the books before going to see the movies, so you can have an understanding of what is going to happen in the movie and then compare the movie to the book. For me, books are always better than the movie because the movies often leave out important details of the books. But, the movie did an excellent job of recreating the book.
B005ZMTYBY|5.0|This is a fun movie to watch anytime of the year but we usually start thinking about it right around October. Songs stick in your head and you just can't help it.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|I was very hesitant to watch this just based on the title alone. After watching the trailer, I figured- \\"why not?\\"- I've always liked Tim Burton so it couldn't hurt to give it a try... You obviously can't take the movie seriously because it is a fictional twist on Abraham Lincoln but nevertheless it is still intriguing and entertaining. The incorporation of the civil war history and Abraham Lincolns political career brought even more excitement to the story. I would highly recommend it :)
1451695195|5.0|Don't look for a scientific explanation for what happened to Dr. Alexander; it would be grasping at straws. Very well written, with a Hitchcockian kicker at the end. Raises as many questions as it anwers, but he has the right to tell his story as he sees fit!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|This package is one of the best I've ever bought for a movie. The two disc dvd with digital copy is a great deal to complement both the home and portable entertainments on my dvd player and ipad respectively. The package is a good deal for any physical format collectors and more importantly, a Hunger Games fan.
B00A0HQ9GM|4.0|Honestly, who buys a CD anymore?  These problems (i.e. missing tracks) only exist because a select few are holding onto the CD revolution of the late '80's/early 90's.  There will always be more issues with physical products than with digital ones.  Be smart, buy the MP3s, and stop trying to revolutionize the world.  All of your problems (and your Lana Del Rey griping!) will vanish.
1455508977|5.0|Nicholas Sparks does a phenomenal job once again. This book is about a love story that just captivates your heart time after time. It shows the fight for true love even in the strangest of circumstances. Prepare yourself to shed a few tears while reading it. You will laugh, cry, and be enraged all along the way. It is an amazing book and I definitely recommend reading it for those who might be considering it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it really does come in handy when I have math homework. couldn't have a better calculator when I need it
B006BDHAX0|4.0|The game plays well with a myriad of patterns. A word of warning, the game does occasionally shut off without warning.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book gives a a new spin on the ever actual question of the justice system. It is flawrd but what is the altetnayive? Showed in yhis boo,, scary maze
B00004WPAE|5.0|Yellow Submarine is the second soundtrack album produced by The Beatles to a film followed by A Hard Day's Night. It's arguably one of their less approachable and catchy albums made over the years. However, it still contains the unique elements of songwriting and sound only The Beatles can produce.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|Quite entertaining. For those who like a good fiction, the special effects were decent.  My whole family, incl. teenager liked the movie.
B008W3034A|5.0|Jane Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice is, in my opinion, one of her best works.  It includes the story of a family who holds the possibility of falling into financial trouble.  In order to maintain financial stability and remain in line with the standards of society, the daughters are pushed into marriage.  This novel recurrently explores the theme of if one should marry for true love or if it is acceptable for the daughters to marry in order to fit in with society and attain financial security.  Jane Austen does a great job expressing the ideals of her society in a creative and interesting manner through her novel.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The best place to keep your fav things from the internet organized. It's very addicting.<br />From recipes, DIY home projects, crafts & much more...
B0043RSJ8G|2.0|I generally like Picoult's books because she explores multiple points of view on complex subjects. In this case, however, her political bias is clear and heavy handed. The Christian characters are flat and stereotyped. The gay characters are too perfect. The ending of this book was too tidy to fit reality and several story threads were left dangling. Where the book was successful was in showing the challenges same-sex couples face. It's not that I didn't like it. Rather that I was disappointed. It didn't measure up to the excellent work I expect from Picoult. 2 1/2 stars.
1593272774|5.0|My 9 year old grandson is ready to move on to Lego Technics and loves this book.  Full of ideas and plans.
B003BWQE04|5.0|Consider one of the most musically complex and relaxing albums Dire Straits have ever produced, Making Movies immerse the listeners into a world of musical romance and paradise; especially with Romeo and Juliet, is the best track to define such mood and emotion throughout the phase.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Pretty good game, though I wish there were more locations so there wasn't as much repetetive back tracking.  Little too short for my taste for a game you have to pay for.  It only took me a few hours to complete.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Schindler's List, a Steven Spielberg Film of 1993 is an absolute masterpiece. Wonderful movie and one of my most favorites of all time! I was quiet thrilled that this movie was chosen by my World Religion course to do a movie review on and has even been a part of my personal movie collection for several years. This movie is extremely vivid with astronomical and heart wrenching detail, which brings it to life and connects the viewer with a feeling as if you are actually witnessing the horrifying tragedy of the Holocaust. You are permanently glued to the edge of your seat and find yourself emotionally tied, rooting for Schindler's success.<br /><br />Liam Neeson portrays an amazing Oskar Schindler in this movie and a more suitable actor couldn't have been chosen for this role. Oskar Schindler is a German Catholic who lives in Poland during the horrific event of World War II. He is a member of the Nazi party, a war profiteer, and a greedy businessman who loves his booze probably as much as his women.  In the beginning Schindler is a callous man that only selfishly cares for himself and money. He begins a journey to open a factory, employing Jews because they are \\"cheap labor\\" and convinces the Nazis of this essentiality. He embarks on this aspect of his journey with his newfound Jewish accountant, Itzhak Stern, who initially refuses to help but then uses his position as an opportunity to save the lives of the Jews, who would be killed at the hands of the Nazis. Eventually Schindler becomes aware of Stern's intent and begins a tirade but Schindler succumbs to the warmth and kindness of humanity within his heart and his compassion for the lives of his workers is bonded. Schindler offers many bribes and money to bring Jews to his factory in order to save their lives. Schindler is fully aware that the lives of his Jewish workers are at the faith of the Nazi party with the construction of the Plaszow concentration camp in Krakow being completed so Schindler convinces a vicious Nazi, Amon Goeth to sell him his Jewish workers. Out of desperation to save the Jews, Schindler has his accountant, Itzhak Stern, to type a list containing the names of Schindler's Jewish employs; these are the Jews that he purchases within his company who will accompany the relocation to Czechoslovakia for their safety. The Nazi party was unaware of Schindler's true motives, to sustain the lives of these Jews and to save as many of them as he possibly could.  The men, women, and children remain at the factory until the war finally comes to an end and Oskar Schindler, along with his reunited wife Emilie, are forced to flee or be hunted as criminals of war. Even though Schindler cried, wishing he could've done more, he was responsible for saving a remarkable 1,100 Jewish lives from Auschwitz during the Holocaust.<br /><br />This movie is a must see!
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I understand how blockstory was an rpg version of minecraft basiclly, and i can accept that,  but come on people this is a total copy. The acellerometer thing with kindle is true. This is the cheapest copy yet-ok mabye not toatally but seriously candyrufusgames thanks for making it cheap but do you have no imagination? Don't buy this is just one of THOSE kind of -------craft games. Candy Rufus you should feel horible about yourself.
B0091REZMW|4.0|It is a good game, but I do not  like it when you need to purchase things in the game.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|it cool I love it plectrum due get this. so awoke and its free #1 and give its 10000 stars
B0000DI7UQ|5.0|Element, Pt. 2 is the second portion of the Elements album. Pt. 2 contains some slower songs which I considered to be the Dusk of Elements album. As it feels like every song on the album is implying the near conclusion of the album. Still an excellent masterpiece compare with its predecessor.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My 10 yr old son loves it! He plays it all the time. Lots of levels to keep him busy.
B009KHBDUU|3.0|I like, but not loved, the movie.  I found it to be a bit slow and not as funny and action packed as promotions had showed.
B00006ADFL|5.0|Totally love novels by Anne Perry.  This movie was very powerful when I realized what her personal history was and the person she has become.
B0058DRUV6|5.0|This is  a must read for anyone needing to improve leadership skills and wanting to take on a greater role in any organization. Simply put, it is a life changer!
B00913P6G0|5.0|Dope beats, catchy hooks, and jaw dropping ryhmes. This is a undeniable classic. Kendrick Lamar is a top lyricist to be respected. His story telling ability is stellar.  His skills is untouchable.  Kendrick Lamar has dropped the top rap album of the year!  GOOD KID M.A.A.D City is dope.  Buy it!!!!!!!!
B006Z21ZJC|5.0|En Vivo is arguably one of Iron Maiden's best live recorded show in the 21st century, next to Flight 666. It marked one of the most memorable moments in the later Iron Maiden career. It's very exhilarating to see that each member is still able to hold up well at an older age. The set playlist consists primarily from their The Final Frontier album with some classical hits. What a great dvd! Highly recommend it to anyone!
B003WTE886|5.0|Happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend purchasing it!  Every song is great and even my kids love to sing along with it.
0345536886|4.0|John Grisham is fantastic. Each novel becomes my new favorite. I usually spend 4 hours straight reading because I can't put his books down.<br /> This was no different; intricately written, and suspenseful. Highly recommended to Grisham fans.
B000LC4B3Y|5.0|Have always loved the Haydn &#34;Creation&#34;.  I have sung it many times and never get tired of listening to it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Suspense, kept you reading until the end. Not what you would expect when it starts out, great ending. John Grisham has always been a favorite.
B000RPCK1U|5.0|I was very pleased with every aspect of this order. It was quick and simple and I felt that it was a nice touch that the feedback card provided by the merchant had a nice hand written note included. DVD was brand new and completed my collection nicely!
B000MU4EGY|5.0|A Hard Day's Night marked The Beatles continuous success over the years with unexpected outcomes of achievements and fame. Obviously, the album was incorporated into a film as a soundtrack album. This also showed The Beatles' influence and impact on music and film industry even today.
B001M5UDGS|2.0|Joss Whedon's work, Dr. Horrible's Sing-A-Long Blog, is a short movie about a villain fighting to be part of the Evil League of Evil. Along his path of acceptance, he encounters problems with his nemesis Captain Hammer and love interest Penny. Whedon uses immature humor and quite a predictable plot to test of traditional views of good and evil.<br />Within the first few minutes of Dr. Horrible's Sing-A-Long Blog, I wished it was over already. The immature hero and villain concept and cheesy dialogue automatically made me skeptical of this short film. Within the first few minutes Dr. Horrible breaks out into song about his love interest Penny and it already made me want to turn off the film because of the ridiculous dialogue. In one part, Dr. Horrible \\"accidently\\" has two frozen yogurts at the laundry mat when Penny comes, but is yet again shot down when Penny begins to talk about Captain Hammer. Many parts of the film include immature and witty humor, only entertaining for the right viewers.<br />The beginning of the end for Dr. Horrible was when Bad Horse, the director of the Evil League, gives Dr. Horrible an evaluation. When Dr. Horrible loses his opportunity to make a move on Penny, no shock here, Captain Hammer swings in on Penny and saves her. And of course, Dr. Horrible's love interest and nemesis start to date. Captain Hammer's character is extremely arrogant and obnoxious, which only made me more irritated. Also when Captain Hammer is honored with a statue, Dr. Horrible is hiding underneath the curtain to hide the statue, simply the only place where you would predict he would be. These are just a few examples of the extremely predictable plot this film has to offer.<br />The acting from Dr. Horrible, Captain Hammer, and Penny was not what I was expecting either. I am not a fan of Neil Patrick Harris in many of his roles, but this role especially turned me off to him. I am not familiar with the actor of Captain Hammer or actress of Penny, but both were not good and turned me off to them, too.<br />The short film challenges the traditional views on good and evil, and heroes and villains. The ending of the film is one you would not expect from the beginning but it only increased my dislike. Whedon does a great job appealing to the viewers who enjoy this witty humor and simply silly sing-a-long genre, but you must be one of these viewers to enjoy this film at all.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Chbosky's story of a young boy trying to find his place in high school can take anyone back. He makes you remember the awkwardness you felt at times, the saddness, and the joy. This is truly an outstanding story for anyone who was a social butterfly or \\"A Wall flower\\"!
0761171703|5.0|I am a photographer myself altough nowhere near a professional. But this book is just phenominal. Mr. Matters' images and stories in the book are fabulous. Thank you for sharing your work with all of us. And thank you to all of the marvelous dancers that drove hours and jumped and posed for the images! You are all so talented and special. God Bless all of you and continued success! One more thing, I ordered this book 2 days ago(lucky for me)and now it is on backorder. That should give you a clue how amazing this book is!

B000007VFU|5.0|Pablo Honey marked the era of alternative rock of different style departing from the earlier predominant pop rock, metal, and punk genres. Pablo Honey includes the hit single Creep which is a completely experimental and stylistic change in both lyrics and roughness of the songs. This can be best defined by Jonny's aggressive guitar playing style and Thom's romantic voice.
0345525558|5.0|We used this as a book club book.  Everyone seemed to like it.  I really did.  It was a very tender and meaningful book.  We had a really good discussion on it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|My husband got this book for me on his kindle ...I started to read it and couldn't put it down...It was captive to the store line ..Let me say it was awesome, I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  A very good read if your a Grisham fan like me...I read it in three days...Now my husband is complaining that he has to get another book for me...He told me to slow down reading these expensive books ...But for $12.99 ...That's expensive.>>> NOT ??????
B000YHG72E|4.0|A movie for everybody.  Both adults and kids will love it.  Funny and a great movie for the whole to watch together.
B009LA1QW6|4.0|The first time I listened to this CD the whole way through, I actually hated it. But I loved her first CD, so I listened to it a few more times and my opinion completely changed. The song I hated the most turned out to be my favorite. I'm not sure I enjoyed this CD as much as her first, but it is more of the unique music that Lana Del Rey offers to her audience. I would recommend this to those who enjoyed her first CD.
B0042290SU|5.0|Killers is one of my favorite early Iron Maiden albums. It is clear that it's progressing more mature than its debut album, with a heavier but more melodic sound.

0553805371|5.0|Stephen keeps things simple enough for the layman to understand, but still enough depth to be through provoking.  If you're looking for math and physics, this isn't the book.  If you want to understand more about the universe without spending years studying it, this is perfect.
B008VBYN80|3.0|good time killer but I can already see that to get far in this game you will need to spend $

0756655307|5.0|I got this for my husband for Christmas who is a huge comic book nerd and he loves it! He spent hours looking up different characters and was so happy with it. Everyone was there. After every super hero movie this past year he came home and looked things up.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I chose this book because I have heard a lot about it and wanted to read it.  I liked it because as I read it, it felt as though ideas in the book living the same moments the main character lived.
B007V65R54|5.0|Nate Silver is a very good writer for a numbers guy; This could be a very dull subject, but he keeps it light and interesting.  Anyone who ever expects to pay attention to any kind of forecast or prediction (isn't that everyone?) should read this book first.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show, always leaves you wanting more.  I dont believe the walker ate his wifes body because there were no bones and the bullet he picked up was clean with no blood.  I think carl looked away when he shot and missed and she is now a walker.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really like how the characters developed. What a wonderful<br /> ending. Can't wait till 3rd book. Hopefully more on closure with Gideon.
0545425115|5.0|I am not an avid reader, but The Hunger Games is truly an amazing book. Suzanne Collins truly has a wild imagination and it is present throughout the entire book. The details in this book are fabulous and leaves you wanting more. I absolutely fell in love with all of the characters. The characters are well thought out and by the end it seems like I knew them on a personal level. The Hunger Games has lit a fire in me to read more. This book is wildly popular and for good reason. Not only is the subject and characters attention getting, but the writing is phenomenal. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves love, struggles between good and evil and just a good story.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I got it mostly for my nieces to play and it is easy enough for them to actually play on their own. I wish there were more cat puzzles or little kid puzzles though.

B004SKJTY6|5.0|Well known, Oscar nominated or winner, can't remember. We love the cast. Great story, based on the true story of course. Highly recommended!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|ok games- a bit repetitive but we killed some time on a long car ride playing them- kept us occupied enough.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is awesome I downloaded this app because I constantly see my friends playing it and decided to get it. once I did I cant seem to take my eyes off it! I highly recommend this game because it is relaxing and fun to play.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|I thought the book itself was well written and the concept was interesting. However the majority of it is depressing with only small victories for the main character throughout. Not recommended if you are looking for something cheery. The main character can be unlikeable, which I always find frustrating in a book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever!!!!! Everyone in my entire family always asks if the can play this on my amazon kindle!!!!!!! It is a great way to entertain and keep kids occupied!!!!!! I lovr this game!!!!! 5 stars all the way!!!!!

0140177396|5.0|Of Mice and Men is an American classic that everyone should read! It tells a wonderful story of the American dream and how life does not always play out how you plan. Steinbeck paints a clear picture of all of the characters and settings making it a smooth read. Over all I think everyone should read this book, you will not regret it.

B0067RQYNW|4.0|I bought Kingsoft primarily for use on trips when my small laptop will take up too much room - which will make me rely on my Kindle for limited word processing.  With that in mind, I have tried out Kingsoft (English) and find it will meet my limited needs.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series definitely keeps getting darker and more intense, but it is so good you can't stop watching.  The actors just make you believe every emotion they are feeling.  Can't wait to see what happens next.
B007MB5OCE|1.0|I guess one has to be in a certain mood or frame of mind to enjoy this book.  It's goofy and silly and satirical, and I enjoyed it for the first 20 pages or so.  By the time I got half way through, I<br />found myself not wanting to read any more.If it had ended at that point, it might have been  a crazy, fun  short story.
0439023521|5.0|This book is addicting! I read the entire thing in one sitting and when I was done I had to run to the store to get the next in the series. The book touches on an aspect of human brutality but it is not too gory. This book is an eye opener that is great for teenagers and adults alike.
B002GJU54E|5.0|This is the last, but the best of the between the numbers novels! Read the others cause your gonna want to read this! Hilarious!

B00913DPW2|4.0|It was actually fun at first. I can tell you one thing though. There is no way to play this game without cheating. Some puzzles were just yo hard. I'm still done because there are'nt walk through cheats for every puzzle. Great graphics though.
B00A7PXBPE|4.0|Short and simple. Great show.  One star off for the Laurel character. I think the producers of \\"The Vampire Diaries\\" and \\"Arrow\\" are smoking the reverse-harem weed. I am not a fan of 2-guys-after-one-girl. I didn't like it in the \\"Twilight\\" series and still don't like it now. I prefer him to have his own love interest, for example the IT girl from his company. Laurel is just a player and irks me with her constant holier-than-thou attitude.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app was recommended on the Kindle Fire forums. My KF-HD had what I considered poor battery life. I averaged 7-8 hours while stream Tunein Radio. My iPad can go for 4 days just streaming radio.<br /><br />I calibrated the battery which took about 1.5 hrs. And I was able to go for 24 hours streaming radio, surfing the web and watching videos AND I still had 35% left. That's amazing.<br /><br />I want to support this dev by buying their paid app but I want to know if the paid app shows you how long the battery has been running vs time spent in standby like on my iPad running iOS 6.0.1?<br /><br />In a real Android environment you get detailed battery statistics but not on Amazon's customized OS.<br /><br />Overall i'm amazed this App increased my battery life by 4X.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I really enjoyed this Novella, it has a very different style of writing from Sanderson's other books, but I still loved it. It's definitely longer than his other Novella he released this year, but I still wished there was more to it. I really enjoyed the main character, and would love to see her further develop and show her varied skills in a full novel. The only problem with the length (other than just wanting more) was that some of the supporting cast were pretty shallow, there just wasn't enough time to make interesting villains. The magic system was a little bit of a stretch, and a little tough to visualize, but it's extremely original and interesting. The basic idea is that everything in the world has a soul, and certain people can apply a stamp they create to change the nature of the object (or person). So a Forger can change a decrepit rotten table into a masterpiece, as long as the new form is believable to the table. Sanderson says in the afterword of the book that this magic is inspired by his time in Korea (as an LDS missionary) and his visits to Museums, where important people would place their stamp and works of art they liked.<br /><br />Shai, the main character, is an expert Forger, and she's captured when she's betrayed after successfully completing a heist where a forgery replaced the Royal Scepter (or something like that). She's set to be executed, but after an assassination attempt of the Emperor left him braindead, the ruling party needs her help to attempt to rebuild his soul/mind. The whole process here is really enjoyable as we learn more about the Forgery magic, Shai's history/personality, and the life of the Emperor. This is definitely a fun little read, it only took me a few hours to finish, which makes 5 bucks a little pricey, but I think it's worth it. I would definitely recommend this novella, especially to fans of Brandon Sanderson.

B004QPOVE6|5.0|This is an amazing show for the most representative band of what rock actually is. AC/DC is pure power, and this concert pretty much sums it up. The video quality is top notch, as well as the audio; you won't be dissapointed by any technical issues here. Perhaps the one thing I didn't like much is the extras; besides the concert, there's not much more to be seen, only a (very) short documentary and a video for the intro of the concert.<br />In terms of the music itself, there's the usual classics, from back in black to highway to hell, let there be rock and all of the songs they always play live. There are 4 songs of the last album, Black Ice, which is a good thing by the way. Some of the songs, they play them at a lower tempo, but keeping them very powerful and true to the band's style.<br />Special mention has to go to the public. The audience itself gives this concert so much power its just amazing. It really adds to the experience to see 70.000 people jumping and singing like crazy all through the entire concert.<br />Overall, I'd say this is a must have for any AC-DC fan. If you're not a fan but are into rock, then you should try this out as well; it's a great way to get to like one of the greatest rock bands of all time.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|but definitely worth buying.  The group continues to evolve and amaze with every album they put out!  This one is a little more different (mellow) than the others, but I really like it.<br /><br />Update:  The more I listen to this album the better it gets 5 of 5 stars!!
B005WUHAX8|4.0|The LifeProof Case reminds me of Virus Protection software.  It can do a good job at protecting but not without a &#34;nuisance&#34; price.<br />The case is waterproof and the buttions all work fine.  Okay, to make it waterproof you have to deal with the hassle on not being able to immediately put your phone jack in to listen to your tunes but rather you must remove a small screwed in piece that has a washer - and not lose it.  The charger enterance is easy to get to but is awfully snug, very difficult to use with charger connections that lock onto your phone and need to be squeezed to release and some after market charger connections won't fit becasue they are slightly larger.<br />My biggest complaint is that it is sometimes difficult to hear people, they don't hear you as well and when you play music it gets muffled by the case.<br />The LifeProof case is very attractive, comforatble, lighter than most highly protective case, and does a great job protecting your phone but affects your talking and listening ability.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I am enjoying this second volume of the trilogy; the story lines pick about 20yrs after the end of the first book.  As with the first volume, I like the \\"historical novel\\" aspect of these books.  He has managed to weave a study of history into the lives of ordinary & not so ordinary people.  I am looking forward to the third book.

B006H8BIIM|5.0|I'm a sucker for tower defense games, and when Space Station Frontier was offered on the Amazon Appstore for free I picked it up. I played it on occasion but it seemed too hard, so I abandoned it until recently when a cold forced me to not do anything outside for a while. It's been a while since I finished any game on any platform, but this game got me to finish it, which speaks very highly of it.<br /><br />The game's premise is that you're a space station commander that's supposed to mine asteroids. You built platforms and power connectors and miners, and of course, laser turrets, missile turrets, rail guns, and other support units. The structure is extremely free form --- you link the objects however you like constrained by the distance between structures and available connections.<br /><br />Of course, while you're doing this, the enemy is sending you various ships to attack you, starting from light fighters easily dispatched by laser guns, and ending up with dreadnaughts, fighter-carriers, and other vessels which require heavier weaponry. The game seemed really tough at the beginning but after a while I realized that I had to visit the shop in order to upgrade my station's capabilities, buy additional weapons, and other upgrades. You get these credits by playing in the \\"open\\" modes (non-scenario modes), and by finishing scenarios in the main campaign. Or you could spend real money and skip the tedium. To the game's credit, it wasn't very much tedium and the open modes are good for exploring tactical or strategic changes to your approach. The reason the game has a comparatively low score on Amazon is that many reviewers seem to think the \\"tedium\\" of playing the open mode is excessive. I didn't think it was. In particular, it took several battles before I realized that one of the major constraints was power --- several laser turrets going at once can severely deplete the power on the station, which meant it didn't matter how many resources you were mining as youcould not have all your guns operating at once. I thought this was a very clever constrained and the game had many ways for you to manage those constraints. It's a smart combination of a resource-gathering RTS with the tower defense genre.<br /><br />In any case, as the campaign progresses, your missions get harder and also more interesting. For instance, the last 5 scenarios has you defending a crippled ship in addition to the space station. Many scenarios are \\"survival\\" scenarios, where you basically have to last a certain amount of time --- defeat is almost certain, so surviving that time was all that mattered.<br /><br />What's interesting is that the Amazon Appstore sells this game for $1.25, while the Google Play store charges $1.98. I have no idea why there's this gap. In any case, I consider the price at either store to be a bargain. This game was lots of fun and great on a 7\\" tablet (either the Kindle Fire, which I was using, or the Nexus 7). I would definitely look forward to a sequel, if any was forthcoming.
B008476HBM|4.0|Tough read, but it's a classic.  Half way through and it's hard to put down.  I recently read Jane Eyre, so I didn't have to look up as many words : )
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Taking all of the side shows going on regarding 12-12-2012, the discoveries being made by NASA and worldwide scientists of dozens of new planets per week, combined with historical archives dating back 35,000 years all the way to 5000 b.c., which to this day cannot be logically explained, Ridley Scott weaves together a broad spectrum of public discourse into an incredibly beautiful tapestry, especially in the BluRay 1080i version. It dares press the boundaries of both scientific and metaphysical discourse, or more precisely, at the point where these two view points diverge from the logical to the probable.<br /><br />Those who watch this movie, with a curious intellect, an open mind and a curious heart about what was, what is, and what will be should find this movie to be extraordinarily imaginative and a great experience both visually as well as spiritually. It makes one look within and at humanity as a whole and consider the destructively primitive side of man, and where it comes from, why it exists, and what all the underground talk about \\"Nibiru\\" and the Giants that once visited earth the last time Planet Nibiru orbited earth 5000 years ago, the  surge in UFO sightings, Project \\"Disclosure\\" involving hundreds of the brightest minds on earth who want to \\"tell the truth to the public\\", the stories we see in SGU, BSG and the old Kubrick films.<br /><br />It borders on creating a unifying theory for both scientists and those who believe in the existence of an intelligent design, not exactly \\"God\\" by any stretch of the imagination, but definitely plays off the question of how we ended up on earth, who created us and why, and is there a reason we are destined to self-destruct as a race, either by self-perpetuated disasters, war, or some other event that even in other 5 star rated Sci-Fi is referred to as \\"The Cycle of Time\\", meaning \\"What Once Was Shall Be Again\\". Has the human race been wiped out before and restarted, how many times has this cycle played out? Is the repetitive story as told by Abraham, and Zarathustra before him, and Moses, and Christ, and Mohammad centuries later a regurgitation of the same story or perhaps a depiction of the same event repeating itself between Zoroaster, the first monotheistic Prophet to Mohammad the last of the Monotheistic prophets?<br /><br />Unless you're an intellectual, you're probably going to rank this movie with 1 star as some of the semi-literate reviews I've read. If you're of the curious type with a high propensity to absorb information like a sponge no matter when and where you come across it, you'll see the delicate weaving of multiple story lines over vast stretches of history, archeological discoveries, anthropological realizations, geological as well as cosmological discoveries on and off earth, all of which has accelerated at a blazing speed over the past decade, making it difficult to not only keep up, but to step back and look at everything from a \\"God's Eye View\\" to make sense of it all in a single context.<br /><br />What Ridley Scott has done in this film is exactly that. He's taken all of the sub-plots of the 2012 prophecy, the Mayan 5000 year cycle, the cave drawings discovered which range from 35,000 to 5000 years old, depicting almost identical imagery, the idea that the pyramids were massive energy reactors of the ancients, and the concept that there's something out there which we have yet to discover that will predate humanity and perhaps prove that we are children of a more advanced civilization who genetically manipulated their own DNA with that of Darwinian evolution at the point where Darwin falls off the proverbial cliff when a massive gap appears in his timeline of evolution.<br /><br />The point is this movie is \\"Science FICTION\\". The brilliance of Ridley Scott shines in his ability to harmonize all these widely held assumptions and ideas about man, where we came from, why we exist, where we're headed, why we probably won't survive because of our destructivenature which appears so primitive the more you engage in BSG, SGU, and this movie.<br /><br />All in all, it is by far one of the most important films to have ever been made, especially in 2012, and there's a grainy, auditory vibe to it which reminds me of 2010 and \\"HAL\\". Mark my words, this movie will become more important in the coming decades than any Orwellian films, or the Kubrick Space Odyssey films, and both made tremendous scientific, philosophical and cosmological leaps of faith that today we still view them in awe and study them in the highest academic institutions.<br /><br />Prometheus will be at the top of that list as it begs many questions to be answered and pondered upon, which is precisely the objective of Science Fiction, which to be valid, must be based on theoretical scientific assumptions that are still in the same infant stages as many of the aspects of Special Relativity and Quantum Physics. Like the most recent confirmation of actually observing a Bose Higgins Particle, (aka the God Particle).<br /><br />The best part was the cost of the voyage, invested by a fictitious private company which if you watch until the end of the credits, you'll be surprised by something unexpected.<br /><br />Regardless of the half-literate, peanut IQ's of those who bash this brilliant film, any of you with intellectual curiosity will be amazed at this movie, especially if you allow the beauty of it to come out via BluRay in 1080i using a home theater. If nothing else, it's a visually dazzling film that ranks with Avatar and even resembles some of the \\"secret NASA footage\\" leaked on YouTube about possible UFO's checking out the space shuttles on their missions over the past 20 years. Especially the shape of the object near the end of the film. (I'm trying to prevent spoiling the end).

B009AZZEU2|3.0|First, I'll say this boils down to yet one more Chris Cornell fan's opinion, but consider the following before dismissing this observation:<br /><br />Starting with \\"Been away too long\\", you get some of Cornell's aggressive vocals and a nice combination of guitars, but right away, something was missing: A flowing, cohesive melody found in past songs by Cornell, such as \\"My Wave\\", \\"Black Days\\", \\"Super Unknown\\", \\"Spoonman\\", \\"Outshine\\", \\"Bulldoze\\", \\"Highway\\", \\"Like a Stone\\", \\"Show me how to live\\", \\"Blow up the outside world\\", \\"Black Hole Sun\\", \\"What you are\\", Light my Way\\", etc. (Soundgarden, AudioSlave).<br /><br />Instead, most of the songs on KING ANIMAL have a slightly disjointed, fragmented melody to them, which for me, was a bit underwhelming, being a big fan of Cornell's gritty, powerful vocals and catchy, hard rock, alternative songs.<br /><br />Granted, this is Soundgarden's first return in over a decade, and there are some nice, melodic songs on here including \\"Bones of Birds\\" and \\"Taree\\", two of my favorites of the album, having listened to it several times now. These two songs immediately caught my attention for their melody in comparison with the previous five songs. Listen for the difference and you might hear what I refer to when I say they have a greater sense of melody.<br /><br />Even so, it's a welcome return, which Soundgarden will hopefully follow up with a new album by 2014. I'm just hoping for better melodies to be up front, and a bit more aggression, which was lacking overall in this album.

B009KHCT94|4.0|This is the silliest film of the year. In fact, it might well be the silliest film of all time. And the fact that it's so totally, deliberately, ridiculously silly is what made me find it so entertaining. The plot is absurd to the nth degree, the acting is a joke (in every possible way) and the mechanics of the whole thing are just out of this world (again in every possible way). The aw,gee,shucks Palinesque President (complete with stuffed polar bears (but no moose!) in the Oval Office) and the \\"Yes, she can!\\" slogan (\\" a war-fighting President in the first term is always re-elected!\\") is a wonderful creation. Pure unadulterated nonsense from one end to the other - but very entertaining. So, ignore the mounting impossibilities, which commence in the first few minutes and go steadily upwards from there (the whole thing is one ginormous impossibility), relax and enjoy. If, however, you're a serious devotee of film as an art form, you should avoid like the plague, unless you have a medical team with defibrillator on standby.

0307383415|3.0|I was not impressed with the book, however, after reading two others reported to be by Barack Obama, I have to think this is the only one he wrote himself.  The style, language used and candor of this book seemed more real to him than the others.  The views appeared to be truly genuine yet likely guarded and only a partial view.  Much of the story perhaps left untold.  All the derogatory references about whites were said to be that of others who were his friends, or family, so why would they not be also his if under this constant influence?  He never states where he speaks out against their views as I myself have done many times when people in crowds around me have spewed racial hatred.  The silence in these matters is deafening Barack.<br /><br />I had hoped it would be a book to aid in race relations, not give reasons for the authors acceptance of the negatives. Even with the absolute color blind acceptance of his white family, he states he could not take that part of his race to heart. He kept it a foreign place in his soul it sounds. But it was his life he wrote of, so it is not my place to judge that!  I perhaps set the bar and my expectations to high!<br /><br />We won't be the true American Melting Pot until these lines are just flat removed from society, our narrative, and not needed but if someone who straddles the line cannot do it, is there any hope at all?  This certainly will not be done inciting more lines to be drawn.

B008G59IKO|3.0|After my disappointment with ¡Uno! I lowered my expectations for this release, and I'm glad I did. To be honest, after a first listen I was more eager to revisit this album than I was with the first installment of the trilogy. This is an overall decent collection, although none of the songs really stand out (other than \\"Lazy Bones\\") and while ¡Uno! had its peaks and valleys, ¡Dos! seems to take us for a stroll through the flatlands. Much of this album's sound is reminiscent of Foxboro Hot Tubs (the band's side project) and it's nice to see them spice things up that way. The opener, \\"See You Tonight,\\" (a folk-infused ballad akin to the early Simon & Garfunkel) and the closing track, \\"Amy,\\" add a different shade to the album's otherwise monochromatic palette. Unfortunately, close to the end of our journey we find a considerable crater in the desert, called \\"Nightlife.\\" I don't know which muse spurred the guys to concoct this, but it instantly became my least favorite Green Day song ever (and I'm afraid I'll forever skip it). I think it's safe to say half of this record is a keeper, while the other half could have stayed in the vaults waiting for a future \\"Shenanigans, Pt.2.\\" As many other fans anticipated (including myself), it seems very likely that by the end of the trilogy we'll finally have an album's worth of good/great material.

It's one thing to make such a personal decision for yourself of this but to come right out and say such following a miraculous return from glory with the world practically hinging on every word of the experience and say there is NO hell!??  His comment scares me many will take his account as \\"Gospel\\" and end their quest for the real truth of our salvation.  The Bible boldly warns us (and more than once) of Hell and you can't believe in one and not the other.  Where, then, DO all the evil people go for their \\"reward\\"??  Furthermore, what about the testimony from Bill Wiesehe in his book \\"23 Minutes In Hell\\". Without question, an absolutley terrifying account of such a visit and by what we'd call a \\"regular guy\\". He didn't \\"deserve\\" his trip either, but definitely came back a changed man and continues to warn of being ho-hum (lukewarm) in your faith. I am very, very happy God returned Dr. Alexander to his family and to the world but also very concerned his sacred and glorious experience did not prompt deeper contemplation of its very opposite by such a brilliant mind. I pray only good will come from his book's witness for our Lord and many lives are changed for the better.  Both books are awesome.

0143039431|1.0|There are few early 20th century books that are more self-important, ponderous, self-indulgent, and overexposed than John Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath. Ostensibly a novel that is intended to highlight the labor injustice in the California agriculture industry experienced by Dust Bowl migrants of the 1930's, the reader quickly finds that the gaunt frame of this plot is heavily draped with endless similes, metaphors, and other descriptive machinations that merely serve to bore even the most persistent. Chapter after chapter Steinbeck's words ponderously crawl across the pages on their hands and knees, begging the reader to flip forward a few pages just to relieve the monotony. It is sure to delight every English literature college professor and fill Steinbeck devotees with self-righteous pleasure and an endless supply of meaningless excerpts to be pressed on unsuspecting but appreciatively nodding folks at the specialty bookstores in Hyannis Port and Berkeley. But for most readers, Grapes of Wrath is an unrewarding chore.<br /><br />Given the novel's pretensions it is no surprise that in the intervening decades legions of harried college freshmen and gawky high school students have been required to read, and lord help us all, interpret the words of Steinbeck in Grapes of Wrath until no remaining literary stone is unturned and whole forests of trees are cut down to feed the maws of the paper mills that produce the neatly ruled blue notebooks favored by professors and teachers for book reports and final exams. This constant exposure and the endless self-reinforcing literary acclaim in the seventy odd years since the publishing of the novel might lead the unsuspecting reader to consider taking it on as thoughtful grist for the mental mill. Let this review serve as warning label that should be on the back cover. There are hundreds of thousands of works written in the century before, during, and after that will better serve to both entertain and provoke the critical thinking the reader is looking for.<br /><br />Yes, Steinbeck was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Grapes of Wrath, a dubious distinction if there was ever one. Pulitzers are liberally handed out to the newsprint literati for purportedly socially meaningful articles and books that uplift the oppressed and cast down the powerful. So it is no surprise the Grapes of Wrath was so recognized for shining a light on exploitative corporate farming interests and the conditions endured by many in the horrid years of the Great Depression. Throw into the mix the ecological disaster of the Dust Bowl and one has a sure fire formula guaranteed to please hard-to-please snarky book reviewers. Is the book a good read? Heck no, but that is hardly the point.<br /><br />Steinbeck, this reviewer is sure, meant to ape Victor Hugo's Les Miserables (1862) when he wrote the Grapes of Wrath. It is telling that even the English translation of Les Miserables towers over Steinbeck's novel in terms of depth and readability, no mean feat when one considers that the French novel was excoriated by reviewers of that era as overly sentimental socialist tripe.  Grapes of Wrath continues to be a tempting resource for classroom assignments, particularly given its message of class struggle, social justice, and the neat ability to refer glowingly to FDR's social engineering conducted in his first two terms in office. Unfortunately this focus is in spite of the fact that the style of writing is tortured and archaic, that most plot elements have not aged well over the years, and that none of the main characters are overly interesting. These drawbacks are real achievements given the continuing relevance of questionable modern agricultural practices and illegal immigrant migrants in the 21st century.<br /><br />In terms of early to mid-20th century social relevance one could do better with The Jungle (1906, Upton Sinclair) or 1984 (1949, George Orwell). In the same era, but for literary visualizations, the reader is much better off diving into Something Wicked This Way Comes or Dandelion Wine (1962 & 1957, Ray Bradbury). And just about anything off of the Amazon bestseller list would be vastly more entertaining.ch better off diving into Something Wicked This Way Comes or Dandelion Wine (1962 & 1957, Ray Bradbury).

B009YX02T8|3.0|From all the songs that I have heard on the album Green Day's The Forgotten stands as a dominant leader. I know a lot of people might think it's weird to put some big rock on the Twilight stuff... and actually, I don't really like Twilight, but the soundtracks are usually pretty good, but this time it's just a bunch of sad melodic songs that don't excite me in any way except The Forgotten. It would be much better to be able to download the song separately.

This is not too much a Rossi-fest as it is a changing of the guard. I loved this movie. If you like bikes, Moto-GP and going fast you need Fastest in your collection.
B006TKP2B2|3.0|\\"The Windup Girl\\" is an award-winning science fiction novel set in Thailand, an isolated country that was able to survive numerous worldwide apocalyptic events.  The novel felt more like a dystopian story than science fiction because the author glossed over the science of generipping, spring technology, etc.  The novel focused much more on the political struggle between two regimes as they vie for control.  The winner can then decide to remain isolated or to open up the country to a more capitalist, world market economy.<br /><br />Based on the title of the book, one might think the story would revolve around Emiko, a soulless genetically engineered creature, but her story competed with that of Anderson Lake, a company man out to acquire access to a \\"seed bank\\" that allowed Thailand to survive. Emiko's story also had to compete with Hock Seng, a paranoid Chinese man seeking to protect himself from a future political coup, and with Jaidee/Kanaya, White shirts out to protect the country.  I wasn't really sure if I was supposed to be rooting for any of them as none of them were cast into traditional good or evil roles.<br /><br />I ultimately rated the book down to three stars because I didn't care about the characters and I found myself more interested in the untold stories (e.g., what happened to bring about the \\"expansion\\" and the \\"contraction\\", what happened in Burma, what is the backstory behind Gibbons, etc.) than the story presented in the book.<br /><br />! WARNING !  Emiko works in a brothel to survive where she endures degrading, subhuman treatment on a nightly basis.  This culminates in a brutal rape scene, which serves as a tipping point for her character and the story.

B009AZZ6H8|1.0|Sorry that I can't agree with the other reviews on here but this album is instantly forgettable. No heaviness, no speedy hooks, lyrics are nothing great. In reality this sounds like another Chris Cornell solo album. Just regular rock that fits on to any radio station. I love the sub pop era of music all the way to down on the upside. This CD seems non essential and an after thought that the record company put out to make more money. A&M should of released a CD of B sides rather than this yawnfest. Not recommended for old fans of the band who are still expecting these guys to rock hard.

B00023B1LC|4.0|Back in 2002, the world was introduced to Jason Bourne.  Some of us knew who he was based on the novels written by Robert Ludlum.  I hadn't ever heard of the books at the time, but a friend of mine was all about them and so we went to the movies and he was disappointed and I was engrossed.  Apparently, the movie was A LOT different than the novels, (I've still yet to read the books), but it didn't matter much to me (or the movie going public).  Even my friend had to admit after he had time to settle that the film, as a whole, was pretty much everything it promised to be.<br /><br />Slick, gritty and engrossing, `The Bourne Identity' springboards a great trilogy that only got more established and more entangled with each new thread.  Now, I have not seen the new Bourne film (with the overrated Renner) but it's not really a Bourne film, so it doesn't count.  Damon is superb in the role, perfectly guarded and mysterious while maintaining his genuine charm throughout.  He is a true movie star here, balancing skill with charisma to create a character we want to watch.  Damon understands shading Bourne's amnesia and he does so in a way that feel genuine.  In fact the whole mystery is worked out rather brilliantly here (and in the subsequent films).<br /><br />For fans of action films, this is a must see.  Compared to the sequels, this film doesn't pack as much of a punch.  It lacks the chaotic energy that Greengrass brought to the series (although I applaud this films use of editing far more than the spastic cuts in `Supremacy') but it grounds the story and tells us something very intriguing and very impactful.  It stands up even ten years later.

B00005JL2O|4.0|I know that I'm in a minority, but I actually think that this was an improvement from the second installment in the Austin Powers series.  It is sharp, funny and while it regurgitates a lot of the same crude jokes, it finds fun ways to spin them.  It is a tad overboard in some areas, but it also manages to feel more modern (if you can call it that), more vibrant than its 90's predecessors.  The inclusion of Goldmember was odd, to say the least.  He isn't the most entertaining villain, which adds to the thought that Myers is certainly stretching himself a tad too thin in this film.  He was so enthusiastically on top of his game in the original Austin Powers film, but like the Johnny Depp in those Pirate films, his shtick starts to grow tired here.  Still, it is fun and will please any fan of the series.

B004SIP7US|3.0|`Gangs of New York' may not be wonderful, but it certainly isn't dreadful either.  The length can be a deterrent because, while it is epic in scope (those set pieces are spectacular), it tends to drag in areas and lose steam thanks to lack of action.  Still, it lies in the hands of the two leads to carry the film, and only one of them is up to the task (maybe `too' up for it) and so `Gangs of New York' winds up feeling longwinded and uneven.<br /><br />DiCaprio, while a capable actor in his own right (and a proven asset for Scorsese) is out of his depth here and winds up turning in a supbar and borderline embarrassing performance as the dreadfully boring Amsterdam.  He muddles through his scenes with death behind the eyes, while Daniel Day-Lewis rises in true hamtastic form to take over the entire film.  I've never been entirely fond of Daniel Day-Lewis (he isn't the acting god some make him out to be) but I do appreciate his gift when used properly.  He uses it well here, but because no one else around him seems to be carrying their weight (John C. Reilly doesn't count since he's not really used here), Day-Lewis becomes overwhelming at times.<br /><br />He's good, but a tad too much.<br /><br />The film takes place in 1863 and revolves around Amsterdam as he attempts to avenge his father's death by killing Bill Cutting.  As I mentioned, Leo never hits his mark.  He doesn't develop his character fully and winds up leaving the viewer a bit tired of seeing him.  The plot drags out a bit too much and I found myself growing bored unless I was watching Day-Lewis chew, chew and chew some more.  Cameron Diaz is way out of her element here.  I'm an avid supporter of her talent and usually am the first to jump in line and defend her to naysayers, but she was pretty lame here.<br /><br />Like I said, this isn't awful, but this is far from good.  There are some great ideas floating around here, but it never came together in a way that felt complete enough to be called a good film.  The sets, costumes and overall techs are all outstanding and truly heighten the experience, but the polar opposite leads and the lack of sharp direction leaves this film feeling incomplete and underwhelming.ilm.

1451696191|4.0|The book is set in the early 90's, thus how many vestiges of the 80's are also present in the book. At first we learn about his challenges at school in terms of friends but also how he appears to be rather gifted intellectually. And of course we eventually learn how things start to change when Charlie manages to befriend two seniors - Sam and Patrick, and how they become his first true friends in high school. But there's more to this novel than just a kid meeting older friends - over the course of the letters we learn more and more about Charlie's past and why he has such a hard time dealing with the rest of his peers.<br /><br />Now the nature of the book certainly affects how the narrative can go. Obviously it primarily means that we will only get Charlie's perspective of the story as he filters everything through, well, his brain. Also, there's that odd sense of somehow \\"missing\\" the action since these are letters that are all written well after the fact. In other words, in most books you seem to follow the action along \\"real-time\\" with the characters. This time around you are being told what had already happened, and this does end up conveying a slight sense of helplessness in things - as if you didn't already feel helpless to intervene when other characters make silly decisions right in front of you as you read along.<br /><br />But these are not bad things in themselves - they are just part of what gives the book character and distinctness. If the movie was more defined by its music, the format of this book helped define the tone. After all, reading someone's letters is not exactly the same as hearing their thoughts in a first person perspective type of tale. We know that since he is writing to someone else, that means he is still potentially filtering out some parts of his accounts as is natural for any of us to do in this circumstance.<br /><br />Now the movie set up a series of \\"reveals\\" all throughout as we slowly get to know Charlie better. In this case many of those same \\"reveals\\" were there but were often delivered more matter-of-factly or were presented in a manner that didn't stress the need for \\"surprise\\" at the revelation. And this ties back to my feelings of \\"missing the action\\" because of the whole penpal letter format. Things just sort of seem a bit \\"muted\\" (it's the best way that I can describe it) when you read about it in this manner, but it still keeps things interesting.<br /><br />The book naturally reminds me of titles like [[ASIN:B000FC1MCS The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time: A Novel]] given the socially awkward protagonist, the (almost) first person perspective and even just the overall tone of a boy who largely watches the world move on without him. And maybe because that was yet another book that I feel strongly about and thus this one has echoes of that.any of those same \\"reveals\\" were there but were often delivered more matter-of-factly or were presented in a manner that didn't stress the need for \\"surprise\\" at the revelation.

I probably would not have purchased it at first glace because of the size and the fact that the pages are paper (with a hard cover).  My toddler seems to prefer hardcover lapbooks to smaller boardbooks.  He can pick it up easily, carry it and turn the pages without ripping them (yet).  He likes the rhyme and pictures a lot.  Sometimes he wants to stop and study the illustrations of the babies.  He also loves Mem Fox's Time For Bed.

B001ANYDAO|3.0|This book was recommended to me by a professor of mine. It has a lot of good/interesting information in it but I'm not 100% certain that all the thoughts in this book are well laid out or at least aren't described thoroughly enough to convince me. I would still consider it a good read, like most of Gladwell's material.
1451650728|5.0|The Enterprise is first on the scene to discover B-4 and all the remaining Soong-type androids missing. But with no clues as to who would or could pull off the heist, Picard and his crew must scour the planet and block the ships from leaving. Suddenly, a face that looks remarkably like Data and B-4 shows up on a scan. But it can't be either of them. I don't think it's much of a spoiler (given the synopsis on the back of the book) that Soong is back. As they say, no one stays dead forever in Star Trek.<br /><br />Over half of the book is Soong's story these past years since he's been assumed dead, till it catches up to the present. The drama, adventure, suspense, and mystery are intense, and the story flows well despite the complexity. Next Generation fans will be very happy with the direction this series takes.  You also don't need to be up-to-date in the books or have to remember what happened over 20 years ago in the show, as this is an inclusive trilogy and Mack does a great job of giving recaps when needed. And I think it's accurate to say this was my favorite Star Trek novel in years. This is the first in a new trilogy, all written by David Mack.  And I have high expectations for the next.

Graham is the guy who taught Warren Buffett how to invest.<br /><br />His text is well organized and readable, but be prepared to skip sections that don't interest you. In my opinion, the book's greatest value is to adjust the reader's attitude. This is not a &#34;get rich quick&#34; book. Losses are possible - indeed, likely - but Graham explains how to minimize the chance of loss and how to recognize damaging impulses. It even offers an easy out to more timid souls.

B00190OHD6|4.0|I'm not the greatest movie reviewer.  I'll be honest about that up front.  I tend to watch movies purely for my enjoyment and will usually rate it based on that alone.  I rarely judge the acting, the script, the development of plot, etc.  I really enjoyed watching this movie because it had \\"a little of everything\\"--something I personally need in a movie.  It made me laugh and cry.  It had seriousness and lightheartedness. The only disconnect I had was at the beginning of the movie.  The plot seemed to make a jump and I was left with a few questions.  I wondered if I missed something in the first 20 minutes of the movie.  Overall, though, it was a movie that I'd watch again and recommend to my girlfriends.  Not sure if it'd be a movie my hubby would watch with me, though.

B0072OFM28|2.0|This is what happens when you take an edgy, well written and well acted show and turn it into a 'b' or even 'c' type series...  toss in more fighting, toss in porn like sex (at least in the first season, there seemed to be a reason), and hope that the viewers will be distracted enough to not notice that the storylines have gotten weaker and more drawn out, that the dialog has become somewhat goofy, that the fight choreography is more quick kill then battle, that the acting seems 'anxious'....  Yes, Andy Whitfield is certainly missed, moreso as it seems like after his death, everyone associated with the show seems to have lost their enthusiasm and is now just going through the motions to meet a deadline instead of put a really fantastic show/story together...
0385344333|2.0|A weak entry in the Reacher series. Action was slow. Ending was rushed. Just didn't care.<br />Biggest nit, however, was that it seemed like Lee Child (or whoever really wrote this one) wordsmithed Wikipedia entries on all kinds of things: guns and ammo, the demographics of Kansas City etc. Without fail, every other page would have some useless information as filler that didn't drive the story forward. It was like watching the American Idol recap episode where no one gets voted off, The midweek filler just to make money. I know it's easy to criticize and I don't imagine I could complete a mystery novel myself but need to express disappointment. Also, the snappy two word James Ellroy style of writing feels tired here and done before.

Abercrombie's writing has peaked, and I've read the other five stories pertaining to these characters (not sure if he has written others that don't entail the adventures of these characters).  Simply astounding and amazing writing technique.  I cannot express the awesomeness of his prose.  I feel that each paragraph was a masterpiece in his own head... cause for damn sure it appears that way to me.

0345528581|4.0|I have started diligently reading this book as I was curious on the principle of it.  I gave it four stars because I have not gotten to the exercise part and not sure if they are for me, a senior who is not as strong as the picture on the cover :) !  So, if I read the whole thing, I may have given it 5 stars or if it did not aply to seniors, then at least the beginning parts of it are useful to anyone who wants to get healthy.  It uses the holistic approach in a sense - not only exercise but awareness of eating right and living a balanced life and he teaches about that.  I like the principle of the philosophy of this man and I still intend to read the whole thing to &#34;get&#34; the basic premises and understand it and then apply it to my life.  I like the idea of keeping things simple as we get healthier and stronger with no need of belonging to any gym or whatever in order to feel better.  The book is definitely empowering to the reader.

B003TML0VO|2.0|I'll just review each song through the album and tell you why this album was pretty disappointing.<br /><br />1. Whole Lotta Love (featuring Chris Cornell): There is nothing that makes this stand out as something other than just a cover version of the Zepplin classic. Santana tries to improvise some of his solo work over the top, but it's not enough to say this version is superior than any other cover version. Quite frankly, i'll stick to the Zep version.<br /><br />2. Can't You Hear Me Knocking (featuring Scott Weiland): Don't even know this song, and it didn't spark me as something worthy of being called a guitar great song. Nothing special.<br /><br />3. Sunshine Of Your Love (featuring Rob Thomas): Rather boring to be honest. There is plenty of other covers out there that sound much better than this one.<br /><br />4. While My Guitar Gently Weeps (featuring India.Arie & Yo-Yo Ma): Santana's choice of vocalist makes this song sound depressing like it's a suicidal song for emo kids.<br /><br />5. Photograph (featuring Chris Daughtry): If you wanna hear the best cover version of this song, check out Jani Lane (R.I.P) of Warrant fame. Those guys did the best cover version of this song, and Santana should have listened to that version to hear how to make a great cover of it.<br /><br />6. Back In Black (featuring Nas): My favorite band is AC/DC, and this attempt at a Black Eyed Pea's version is just f'ing horrible. It's not the worst AC/DC cover I have heard, but seriously, this is Santana, and that's the best they could come up with?<br /><br />7. Riders On The Storm (featuring Chester Bennington & Ray Manzarek): Zzzzz, stick with the Doors.<br /><br />8. Smoke On The Water (featuring Jacoby Shaddix): Interesting that Santana tried to add a new riff over the old one, the vocalist sounds ok, it's one of the better song covers on this album, but in the end, I would rather be listening to the kick @$$ version by Metallium. A Metallica tribute band. (check that versionout)<br /><br />9. Dance The Night Away (featuring Pat Monahan) Zzzzzz<br /><br />10. Bang A Gong (featuring Gavin Rossdale): Just does not hold a candle to the classic Robert Palmer version.<br /><br />11. Little Wing (featuring Joe Cocker). It's amazing that someone like Santana can't do what good ole Jimi did.<br /><br />12. I Ain t Superstitious (featuring Jonny Lang) Zzzzz<br /><br />Overall. Not a very good effort at all with no covers that stand out as better than the original or better than someone else s covers they recorded.
B001TODCII|4.0|If you like the type of movie that has plot twists, unexpected turns, and requires some thought to predict what may happen next, this is not your movie.<br /><br />I found &#34;Taken&#34; to be standard fare for action/thrillers; it's the skillful acting and the exacting of revenge for an unspeakable crime that kept me watching and wanting more. If my daughter (or niece) was kidnapped and sold into sex slavery, I'd definitely want to do to the &#34;bad guys&#34; what they get in &#34;Taken.&#34; Liam Neeson is a great actor and can convincingly play any role, and that applies to his character in this movie. Maggie Grace performs well in her role, and Famke Janssen (for whom we see too little) is also very convincing. The other bit players were well cast.<br /><br />The biggest complaint I have is kind of trivial. After some of the more intense action scenes, I came to realize there wasn't any blood being spilled. Sure enough, when I slowed the movie down to single frames, none of the actors have blood packs on them when they get shot. The blood is added afterward. This was especially apparent when Neeson's character shoots someone in the face at point-blank range and instead of his head exploding, his head snaps back — no blood at all. It's a cheap way to film action sequences, but the action is fast and furious and not many people will notice that point.

B008D19WBQ|4.0|For anyone who thinks that these episodes are cut, please read this review from Gord Lacey at tvshowsondvd(dot)com:<br /><br />\\"Alright, let's deal with the \\"elephant in the room.\\" You may have read, or heard that these episodes are cut. That's completely false. These are the original airings of the episodes (with a couple exceptions, which I'll get to later) that were seen on NBC. If you sat down to watch the show on \\"Must See TV\\" Thursdays, this is what you would have seen, except it's in HD (and widescreen). When Warner Bros released this on DVD, years ago, they added material - stuff that was deleted from the episodes for whatever reason. When you create a TV show you log everything - all the shots, the timecode, everything. It's well-documented, and finding the material you need again is a relatively easy task. Unfortunately that wasn't the case with the extended episodes; records weren't kept, timecode didn't exist. That makes the task of finding the material to recreate the extended episodes a daunting task; one that likely would have made Friends on Blu-ray financial unfeasible. I think a good comparison would be what CBS is going through with Star Trek: The Next Generation, except that they're recreating episodes in HD that can bring them other financial revenue streams, while Friends would have to recoup everything from this one set. I think the irony here is that if Warner Bros didn't go to the trouble to create the extended episodes for the DVDs, there wouldn't be any issue with this Blu-ray set. I've gone through the entire set and noted the times of every episode, which you can find at the end of this review (I think I need a new remote now).<br /><br />There were 4 \\"Super-Sized\\" episodes in season 7, and while those longer episodes aren't here in HD, they entire episodes are available as SD bonus material. Those are the only episodes that differ from the \\"broadcast night\\" versions.\\"<br /><br />[Taken from: tvshowsondvd(dot)com]<br /><br />See, it's not so bad. If they would have gone through to find all the episodes that they extended, it would have taken them much longer and the cost would have been astronomical!<br /><br />Long story short, amazing to see in HD like on TBS/Nick at Nite. If you already have the series on DVD, then maybe you'd be happier with what you have and not buying this Blu-ray set. However, if you have been like me and waiting for the Widescreen HD episodes, then this does just fine. They are pretty much the same as what you'd see on your local TV station's syndicated version or on TBS/Nick at Nite.

B00A0NOF7G|5.0|I just adore sitting down for half an hour or so with a quick, funny read to get my mind off the everyday hassles. With that said, I was not disappointed when I chose Killer Cupcakes (A Lexy Baker Bakery Mystery)! First of all, any book that includes recipes for the items made in the book ranks high on my list. But this book caught me from the beginning with it's humour and \\"little-town-everybody-in-everybody-elses-business\\" storyline! Lexy's Nans and her posse of retirement home sleuths were as adorable as could be and I think I was as shocked as Le I to find they were quite computer say! Throw in a little romance with the cop that lives next door, a dead ex-boyfriend, and a bakery partner who is upset about her raspberry turnovers being ruined, and you've got a recipe for a wonderful read!

B001JNNDGA|5.0|While to some the scenes of violence may be seen as excessive the emotional impact balanced it out it was never violence for the sake of violence but to show or attempt to show some of christs enourmous suffering. The scene with Mary picking Jesus up will soften most of the most hardened hearts, I love many of the 50's type bible epics but this one was the first to promote a real emotional connection, the fact thats its no in english will not bother you it actually enhances the film Mel gibson has hit the bash train latley I enjoy the majority of the films he directs the music the emotion and the fire i really appreciate about the guys films.

B005LAIHZY|4.0|Certainly there is no letdown on the Pixar quality when it comes to animation.  And they have broken a bit of tradition when it comes to animated fairy tales aimed at children with \\"Brave.\\"  And that's a good thing.<br /><br />Here we have a teen-age Merida (Kelly Macdonald), a Scottish princess who is more interested in archery than being married off by the King (Billy Connolly) and Queen (Emma Thompson).  When forced to choose between a trio of unworthy suitors, she rebels going deep into the forest where she meets a \\"wise\\" witch (Julie Walters).<br /><br />In one of the funnier scenes, Merida agrees to buy all of the old woman's artwork - she has a small business of mostly wood carvings - in exchange for a spell to be used on her mother to change her mind.  Unfortunately, Merida doesn't read the small print, so-to-speak and the spell turns mom into a bear, but still with human characteristics; at least until the spell becomes permanent.  This is the tension of the film.  Can Merida fix things so Queen Mum can be her old self?<br /><br />It is refreshing to see that the movie foregoes the traditional rescue by a handsome prince.  That film tradition coupled with a story line that eschews the tradition of the Kingdom is a nice turn.  While the film is well made and holds the audience attention, it lacks much of the humor that most of us grown-ups look for.  Recognizing this movie isn't aimed at me, it should be a worthwhile option for the youngsters.<br /><br />I watched this film at home on a 63\\" Plasma HDTV and I must say, I was stunned by the beauty of the transfer.  As stated earlier Pixar never disappoints and the technical wizardry carries over to the home system.  As you would expect the resolution is 1080p with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Every color is represented and the blacks are black.  Small details like freckles, beard stubble and wrinkles are clear and sharp.  Remarkably good picture.  If anything the audio is even better.  The package comes with a Dolby TruHD 7.1 surround and in a word, it's magnificient.  The package is loaded with extras including a commentary track, a couple short films, promotional pieces, extended scenes, behind the scenes documentary and much more.y TruHD 7.1 surround and in a word, it's magnificient.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|\\"The Life of Pi\\" far exceeded my expectations. It is well-written, compelling, beautiful, and so imaginative. Pi, the main character, tells his story, one of spiritual connections, guilt, redemption, and loss, in such a way that when he described thirst, I actually wanted some water. The author uses beautiful words, something that always draws me to a book, and has aced the art of story telling. Given that the book has been popular in the past and is being made into a movie, I was honestly a little cynical, but I read the whole book in 2 days! I was really sorry to reach the end, just because it was the end.
B00846REIS|4.0|a little slow at the start of the book but it soon caught me just like 50 shades did. I will read the others I like it very much.

B009G7ZYPY|3.0|Listened to common songs between this album in Apple iTune and Jackie Evancho's \\"Dream with Me\\" and \\"Songs from the Silver Screen\\".  Comparing side by side, Susan falls short.  Donny Osmond's performance is so so.
B0050F6JQE|5.0|I agree with the other reviewers here - this is a terrific set.  It contains ten CDs of Victoria's music, a good deal of which has not been recorded before and all of which is simply sublime.  There are some magnificent recordings of Victoria available and this stands with the best of them in my view.  (You may like to be aware that Michael Noone has chosen not to record what is probably Victoria's best-known work, the Requiem of 1605;  the setting of the Missa pro Defunctis here is the 1583 setting - a lovely setting but possibly not the one you may be expecting.)<br /><br />The performances are uniformly excellent and worthy of the wide praise which has been heaped upon them.  The singers are technically excellent and show a fine empathy with the music and texts.  Noone also uses sackbuts, cornets and organ in a few places. As in his fabulous recording of Guerrero's Requiem [[ASIN:B000038I8U Guerrero: Requiem]], this is very sensitively done and genuinely enhances the vocal lines rather than distracts from them.<br /><br />I could go on at length but others have already said all that needs to be said.  I will just say that this will take its place alongside my treasured Victoria recordings by The Tallis Scholars, The Cardinall's Music and The Gabrieli Consort.  I can offer little higher praise than that and I recommend this set very warmly.

B009NPKTN6|5.0|I hate most 80's music! Obviously, not any more! :)This movie was very entertaining... it was something both my husband and I agreed on.
B004M9ZI0M|5.0|A great movie and interpretation of this play. As a director, I know this can be a challenging piece. If you direct something you must love it ....or it does not work. My favorites were all the Ariel bits, and all of the magic elements. The actors well chosen with the exception of Russell Brand who just feels too modern, which ruins the suspense of disbelief. Also missing were the goddesses at the wedding , but....one can see the importance of cutting bits for time.<br /><br />A very good buy !
B009FB3WQ4|3.0|Barbra is great and, actually, mesmerizing in her performances.  The other performers are wonderful but, like someone else wrote, would have liked a bit more of the event on the DVD thus the 3 stars. The entire event seems a bit rushed and unfocused.  I am sure the evening was more impressive than this.  Anyway, its still great to see and hear these singers.

B00A22YFDY|2.0|I gladly took advantage of the special discount offered on the digital downloads of &iexcl;Uno! and &iexcl;Dos! the week they came out, and while the first did not disappoint, &iexcl;Dos! is an unmitigated disaster. The only reason it earned 2 stars is because I didn't have the heart to criticize more honestly after Billy Joe revealed his addiction issues - maybe that's what made this \\"album\\" so terrible.<br /><br />I always listen to a new album all the way through, track-by-track, as if I had just purchased the cassette or vinyl. I'm usually quite excited to see what the artist wanted to do with the album concept. Here, it's pretty clear that Green Day just wanted to release three albums instead of one, and the second installment in this collection is definitely not worth the money I paid. There may be as many as three tracks on &iexcl;Dos! that would have made the first cut on a full studio album (Amy, Lazy Bones, and maybe Stray Heart), but these really do feel like the songs that were left on the chop room floor when they were done recording.<br /><br />I really respect Green Day as a band, and I have ever since I first discovered them nearly 20 years ago, but this particular release should have stayed in house. Maybe it could have been released as a deep tracks or bonus cd to go with &iexcl;Uno! and the upcoming &iexcl;Tr&eacute;!, but as a stand-alone album it's terrible. I'm honestly planning to delete at least five of the tracks after I've given the album it's mandatory 1-month listen. This was a sad review for me to write, but it was also a painful album to listen to, and I sincerely hope that &iexcl;Tr&eacute;! will be A LOT better. For the first time ever, I will be listening to the full album online before purchasing the next installment in this Green Day opus.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Sweet, odd story. Big-name actors in a little-publicized movie. That tells you something about the quality of the film. Endearing. If you liked the TV series \\"Pushing Daisies\\" you might like this. Similar visual effects.
B003UBTX72|5.0|Enjoyed this book very much, it was funny in spots and brought back the era of earlier times in the USA deep south. Keith Richards has had a facinating life.
B007DIQC90|5.0|it took exactly 2 listens for me to fall in love with this cd. now it's in my rotation constantly. along with mumford, florence, two-door cinema club, metric, etc. when i first heard them, they kind of reminded me of the xx (their first album). i highly recommend this cd and am looking forward to what they do next.
B007XWFZSA|5.0|Let's get one thing straight. This book isn't necessarily about teaching you how to be a good consulting interviewee; it's also about how to be a good consultant period.<br /><br />The one thing that Victor does very well is give you an inside look on how the consulting industry works as well as how a consultant thinks, behaves and approaches a problem. If you have a good grasp of these concepts, then with practise, the case interviews will be a snap.<br /><br />A lot of the other books place too much emphasis on memorizing frameworks. Victor, on the other hand, preaches about the importance of good problem-solving technique and habits. It makes sense. If you understand the importance of formulating a hypothesis and can form robust issue trees, you can crack any case that is presented in front of you.<br /><br />Of course you do require lots of practice and hard work, but it's pointless to practise the wrong way. The ultimate question has to be: do you want to be a good interviewee or a good consultant? If it's the latter, then you can do a lot worse than pick up this brilliant book.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|Im not the biggest Rush fan, meaning, if the album is not good, I won't listen to it, period.<br /><br />There are a number of Rush albums I have grown with, and amongst them several great albums, and then some not so great.<br /><br />Here's what surprised me about Clockwork Angels (CA for short):<br />-Heavy fat guitar riffs.  Still with a good dose of chorus, which is Alex Lifeson's signature sound, but this is harder and bigger than other Rush album before it!<br />-Very good new and original chord progressions from Alex.<br />-Every song on this album is at least Very good.  Most songs are GREAT.  No fillers here!!!<br /><br />This has made my top 5 Rush album list.  I have been listening for 3 weeks now, just can't stop.
B009LDXQGW|4.0|After digging into the crates into his three mixtapes that make up this debut album, I must say that the music is perfect for those who like real R&B talent mixed with some edginess into different genres. I want to give it a 5 out of 5 but I prefer the Discs 1 and 2 over Disc 3. So, I'm giving this Trilogy a 4.5 rating that's just on the verge of a perfect score. My favorite mixtapes that are apart of the composition of The Trilogy are House of Balloons (Disc 1) and Thursday (Disc 2). The best songs in my opinion in no particular order are:<br /><br />The Birds Part 1<br />Wicked Games<br />The Party and After Party<br />High For This<br />Loft Music<br />The Morning<br />Life of The Party<br />Heaven or Las Vegas<br />What You Need<br />House of Balloons/Glass Table Girls<br /><br />This dude got great vocals and diverse concepts that keep you hooked to the music. Even though his vocals steal the show, the production from his team, Doc McKinney and Illangelo, is superb to complement his style and explore the depths of all music genres. Honestly, I'm not really feeling his third mixtape Echoes of Silence (Disc 3) because I feel the music is too dark and ambiguous with no catchy songs I like to play over and over again. But there's a huge portion of his fan base that loves Echoes of Silence, so he's doing something right to appeal to everyone. The bonus tracks are cool to complement the themes for the individual mixtape themes. It's not included in the 3 Disc Trilogy, but his new song \\"Enemy\\" is better than the 3 bonus tracks he added on this album. I respect The Weeknd's talent and consistency to deliver three quality mixtapes within one year. This is just the beginning for him and he will definitely enjoy the fruits of his labor with success and a crazy cult following. He even outshines other artists with his vocals and content, Drake's \\"Crew Love\\" and Wiz Khalifa's \\"Remember You\\".<br /><br />Also, I just stumbled across it today but if you want to check out oldermaterial from The Weeknd, find the lost mixtape Before The Balloons featuring \\"Birthday Suit\\", \\"Love You Through Her\\", \\"X Ray\\", etc to complete your Weeknd discography.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Great Sherlock Holmes. not droll, excentric holmes, Lucy Liu is a good pairing. Modern day new york with all the dectective trappings.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|2012 has been a great year for music in my opinion, but this album stands out as being something that is not only quality but also very unique. It's a sound that is hard to describe, but you feel like you're hearing the occasional sounds of Moby, Depeche Mode and radiohead mixed into some absolutely new electronic, indie rock awesomeness. Although unique, I don't think this album is so far off from the mainstream to be un-enjoyable for people who typically listen to a more mainstream sound. I streamed the album twice, but had to buy it; a really great listen.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I am really happy with this app. My regular alarm clock conked out on me just as I was going to bed. I did a search for apps on my Kindle and this one was at the top of the list. I downloaded it, set it (very easy to do) selected the alarm sound I wanted, and my Kindle woke me up the next morning. Haven't bothered getting another alarm clock. Don't need one! So this app saved me money.
0345803485|2.0|I had to read this after all of the hype about it. I would not recommend it to a friend to read. It was very predictable. I think what bothered me the most was how repetitive the author was. If I had a dollar for how many times she said \\"inner goddess\\" and \\"murmur\\" I might indeed be a billionaire just like Mr. Grey. The second book got a little better, and I started the 3rd book and it has been 3 months and I haven't finished the book yet. I will finish it, but I never let a book sit like that without finishing it.

0316228532|4.0|Just finished this last night and had to post my first-ever book review on Amazon.<br /><br />The first 100 pages are the toughest to get through because of the sheer number of characters introduced.  Write them down.  Believe me, it will help.  After that, the characters intertwine beautifully.  The ending is satisfying yet sad. This is NOT for kids.  Very adult topics.<br /><br />Some reviewers have said that there aren't any sympathetic characters.  Not true.  They are just super-flawed.<br /><br />Again, if you are expecting anything like Harry Potter, don't read this.  But if you'd like to read a superbly written character study, a month or two in the life of a small town with big issues, read it and savor it, and be glad for your happy, relatively drama-free life (that is, if you've got one!).
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|i love the game. gave four stars, because i harlte waiting on more coins. lol. my little one likescthe game,too
B004HYHANK|4.0|I am a new addict of crime mysteries/thrillers, and Hannah is quickly becoming a go-to author. The suspenseful plot and changes in perspective kept me on my toes and unable to put the book down! She allows you to play detective, while still throwing in twists you couldn't predict. Hannah somehow makes you identify with each character, even when you may not want to, and I found myself cringing and huffing in frustration along with whatever the characters were experiencing. The only reason it didn't get my fifth star is because, while the main mystery was satisfactory in conclusion, I felt like the ending kind of left more to the imagination than I may have liked. Cutting off in the middle of a conversation was a frustrating way to end such an otherwise great book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awesome games, it gets hard and tu get mad sometimes but its is a good game to waste time with. The saying &quot;time flies when your having fun,&quot; is try when you are playing this game. Awesome game, its definitely worth buying!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I watched the Alien original before I rented this because of the advertisement linking the two movies.  Who can forget the Alien after you've enjoyed that oldie but goodie.  Then I rented the video on Amazon - why buy when you can rent, eh?  I liked this movie so much I then bought the blue-ray.<br /><br />The movie, I give five stars.  I am looking forward to the sequels that are sure to follow.  Fantastic story line, great effects and the effects dont' overwhelm.  The acting is awesome - even the side cast did a fantastic job with believable characters.  So much so that you can't tell who the main players are for quite a while - and the twist at the end made me go \\"wow!\\"<br /><br />The Blue ray menu system on this particular set is my only complaint.  It requires a huge amount of memory and if you don't have aux memory on your blue ray player, you will get an error message - then you can watch the movie.  Without the menu system, though, you cannot watch the extras which are pretty good.  To give perspective, I never watch the extras typically, and a movie has to be fantastic for me to bother.<br /><br />My one complaint about the deleted/alternative and extended scenes is you cannot watch the movie with those add-ins so you can see the impact on the story.  Since they were all batched together, I couldn't really even pick out the alternative paths and wasn't able to figure out what was diffent as far as an alternative ending goes.<br /><br />So if you want a fantastic movie, like sci-fi and want to see what turns out to be a stretch-of-a-prequel to Alien, rent the movie.  If you want to own it like I did after watching it, look for a better packaging that gives you the ability to select rewatching the movie with the alternates in line.  If you have no memory storage add-ons for you blue-ray player, you could be disappointed by the disk, but not by the movie!
B000FC130E|4.0|This book is a great, easy, engaging read. It reminds me a bit of an adult Harry Potter that is well written and much darker. I enjoyed it and read it very fast! If you're like me, and you really WANT to like fantasy books but you often find the writing in that genre to be, well... terrible... then you'll probably love this book! Neil Gaiman is a great writer. I also had no problems with punctuation or weird spacing in this Kindle book, which is something I've seen in others.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Really funny and a good read for kids. Can not wait for the next book by Jeff kiney thanks for everything
B000SEGUDE|1.0|Sorry,  I didn't like the book at all.  I found it disjointed and hard to follow any plot line.  I don't know what all of the hype was about.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I purchased the Anker Astro2 charger in anticipation of Hurricane Sandy. I knew we would likely be without power for 1-2 weeks, and needed to have a backup charger for my cell phone and iPad. After an initial charge of about 6 hours, the Anker was able to charge my iPhone 5 and my iPad simultaneously. It gave them both a full charge and had one \\"battery indicator light\\" left afterwards. I was able to get about a half charge of my iPhone after that. After fully charging the Anker a second time, I have found that it will give my iPhone 5 almost three full charges. This item was an invaluable purchase for us. We were without power and land-line telephone service for 8 days and would have been lost without it. I hope that it continues to work as well as it has so far.
B007MDB6L0|2.0|SPOILER ALERT: Tinker Bell gets her wing broken, but her twin sister Periwinkle is able to heal it (broken wings are supposed to be incurable.)  So essentially the consequence of Tinker Bell's mistake that caused the break is erased.  Also, when Pixie Hollow is frozen, the Lord of Winter Woods says, \\"This happened because we tried to keep [Tinker Bell and Periwinkle] apart.\\" - So the blame for the catastrophe is put on the rule and the rulemakers (Warm fairies are not allowed to cross the border into Winter Woods and vice versa).  There is no responsibility placed on Tinker Bell and Periwinkle for choosing to break the rule.  I would have liked to have seen a more balanced resolution that values obedience for the sake of safety, and taking responsibility for one's actions.<br /><br />All THREE of the other Tinker Bell movies have terrific moral lessons:  accepting who you are, forgiving others and valuing friendship, tolerating and learning about those from other worlds (cultures), putting others before yourself.  But from a parenting perspective, given that Tinker Bell is the heroine and the role model when little girls do their natural copy-cat role-play, this one was a big disappointment!
B00729GQ0A|5.0|The characters in this story were spellbinding! Each one is so fully realized and developed, from their histories to their idiosyncrasies but Hamilton does this in an engaging way that does not pause the story to dump information on you, leaving you breathless with the fast pace and intrigue! Sophia was particularly endearing with a STRONG personality. She isn't without fault and she has her weak moments that she has to overcome but overall she does what she needs to do and doesn't whine about; such a welcome change from most young adult fiction!<br /><br />The complexity of the story was astounding especially the way everything comes together in a way that makes sense but still shocks you to your bones! Hamilton cuts out the fluff and sticks to the meat of the story, making this story very focused. Hamilton's descriptions are lavish and the structure of her world is detailed without being boring, taking the time to set down all the puzzle pieces but not going on for pages and beating the reader over the head. This engaging read was easy to become a prisoner to, losing me hours of sleep when I stayed up to finish the second half of the book after work one night.<br /><br />I have read so many books in this genre but Forever Girl really stands out in a memorable way! Highly suggest giving this one a try.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I must say this book made me think about time a little bit more considerately. It's so easy to take it for granted and I can't count the number of times a day I wish the time would slow down or speed up. This book is a great read with a thoughtful message. Highly recommend (it doesn't take long to get thru).
B002VUFKG6|5.0|This is a non-fiction sequel to Eat, Pray, Love.  Elizabeth Gilbert does an interesting, extensive exporation of marriages from a unique perspective.  Not only is she extremely informative evidencing a tremendous amount of research, but is very enjoyable reading.  By Antonina Westerlund
B009KHDT0C|2.0|I thought this movie was dumb. I didn't watch the original tv series or anything so i didn't know what to expect. I watched because i love Johny Depp. Maybe tv.series fans can appreciate the movie more than I.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I bought this blu-ray version because I wanted to capture the splendor that I witnessed the first time I saw it in the theaters.  The quality is fantastic!  Batman is my favorite &#34;superhero&#34; and this movie comes close to what I always envisioned a true adaptation of this great crime fighter.
1451613512|5.0|This is a very powerful book. It captures the history of America's forgotten heroes. It also goes beyond the historical myths told in high school history textbooks.  Moreover, this work complements Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States. While Zinn's work primarily deals with social forces that shaped America, this work discusses the rise of the American Empire, and its consequences. Thus, this works places American history in an international context, and raises questions about America's role in the world. As a companion book to the Untold History documentary, this work is not only thoroughly researched, but also accessible to any one that has a desire to look beyond the traditional historical narrative.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love John Grisham books and this one did not disappoint.  The story was well developed, had lots of twists and turns and kept me interested enough to finish it in a couple of days.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Addicting and fun. The same game on both the Apple iOs, Android platform, and - if you can actually believe this - even the Kindle! Miraculous!
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Iron Man is a cool superhero.  The suit is great with all of its fancy hi-tech gadgets.  But the real success behind the Iron Man character belongs to Robert Downey Jr.  With all the ups and downs this guy has been through, it is nice to see him finally make it to the top and stay there.  Robert Downey Jr.  has always shown his great acting abilities in the different roles he has played.  This blu-ray version is top notch with excellent picture and sound.  I would highly recommend this movie to any superhero buff.

B006WXHJNU|5.0|I enjoyed this movie much more than the first Hulk movie.  Ed Norton does a very good job portraying Bruce Banner.  Too bad he wasn't cast in the Avengers but then again, Mark Rufalo did a good job in that movie.
B007L6VR12|5.0|This movie is a fun and witty portrayal of the emotions and struggles associated with middle childhood. While the movie has a big-named cast, all of whom do a wonderful job, the two lead children are the center of attention and their acting is incredible. If you're a Wes Anderson fan, you'll probably love this movie, and if you're not familiar with his work, it is a great way to introduce yourself to his films.

B002RI9ZPY|4.0|I really enjoyed the third book of this trilogy although I must admit that reading it on Kindle can sometimes prove to be not quite so convenient. Often I wanted to just turn back the pages and remind myself of a particular character but with a Kindle it is more difficult than with a book.<br />The story itself is very gripping and although I had to keep focused on the many characters being introduced throughout the story, it all came to a dramatic end and the whole read was worth it!With the authors death, it leaves us with an unsolved mystery - who is Salander's sister and how does she feature in her life. She was mentioned a few times but no light was thrown on this character.
B009NPM5Y2|2.0|Funny movie, but was not impressed.  good for mindless entertainment only.  Would not recommend unless there was nothing better to do.
B009KKLQKO|2.0|When I first saw this was being released I was excited. That is till I saw the song listing. What the hell? I saw them twice during the tour (Berkley & Lake Tahoe) & more than 1/2 the songs they played aren't here. While one of the greatest music groups in history, be it sue happy Mike's announcement before the 50th tour even ended that he was going back to his half assed version of the Beach Boys, bad business decisions too numerous to count & just plain not being able to get along this highly anticipated video is yet another blunder. The star rating doesn't reflect on the quality of the band itself but on the quality of this package. I sure hope they release an audio version of the whole performance. A vinyl issue would be nice. For now a recording of the NPR, Rolling Stone & subscription radio shows & inferior quality audiance recordings are going to have to do till the real deal comes along.
0743496736|1.0|I thought this book was sophomoric, laborious and rambling.  It's my first Picoult.  I was disappointed and by the middle started skimming over the parts that already seemed to have been written.  I am always surprised when a book like this is a #1 New York Times bestseller.
B0050OMJIW|2.0|Don't know if this is meant to be funny, at least I am not laughing. All the characters are indifferent to me, still haven't figured out what is the plot after 80 pages, so I'm really struggling to finish this one.

B008MLNDEO|5.0|The music in this movie really made the movie great. Very inspirational and the composer did a spectacular job on creating a  Motion Picture Soundtrack to go directly to the movie.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|This is short because I just wanted to rate it and give it 5 stars and not review it.<br /><br />A couple weeks ago I heard 'Thrift Shop' on Faction (Sirius XM)and thought it had a pretty awesome sound to it.<br />I then checked out the video on YouTube and after about 5-10 viewings of all the different videos and reading the Wikipedia page I decided I like the sound and message coming from Macklemore & Ryan Lewis. I purchased 'The Heist' later on Amazon and loaded up on my phone and the SD card in my car and have listened quite a bit since.<br /><br />There is an intelligence and clarity in their music that resonates with you after listening a few times. There's a message in most of the music and there is still some good fun over great beats!<br /><br />I may be late to the party but I am now a fan. Being late to the party is only an issue to the people who weren't. I enjoy the music and applaud their product!
B009GIPDQS|5.0|Grisham delivers again! His knowledge of the legal system and specific topics he writes about is unparalleled. In addition, story plot is very believable and complex enough to make reader guessing to the very end.
B009KHBDUU|3.0|I wouldn't call this a must-see. It was interesting enough to keep me entertained but it was not great. Barely a 3-star, but that's just my opinion.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I loved this book, it was detailed enough, but not too much. She did a wonderful job letting us into her horrible world. God bless her and her children.
B008EL4YX6|3.0|I had this game on my Droid X and loved it.  It's a great game, but now that I have my new Samsung Galaxy Note 2, I cannot enjoy it any longer.  The game does run on the Note 2, but you'll quickly notice once you get to a puzzle that the graphics are corrupted.<br /><br />The little triangles that rotate are not triangles, but rather a \\"blob\\" of corrupted graphics of some sort.  Therefore, you cannot tell which direction the triangle will reflect the ball.  I'll upgrade my rating of this game, if they ever correct the graphics fault it has on the Note 2.

0393317552|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read.  I plan to read it again and have recommended it to many others since (and they liked it too).
B009439HEY|5.0|As other reviewers here have said, this Genesis Revisited II recording is pretty much a note for note (and effect by effect) reproduction of many of the early Genesis classics (and some of Hackett's early solo works), and the vocals being the only overtly noticeable difference, are often done in a way to mimic the tone and intonation of Gabriel and Collins (making their absence all the more noticeable). So, what we get is really a revising by Hackett of (presumably) his favorite old songs, giving them a reworking, more as a hobbyist building old tall ships in small bottles than as an artist. The musical effect is quite impressive though (like with \\"Please Don't Touch\\" sounding at times more like modern King Crimson than how he sounded when he left Genesis) - sharp, clear, aggressive and clearly loving.<br /><br />It's fitting that given that we hear this revisit through Hackett's lens all the material sounds more consistent (less division between early Genesis, post-Gabriel and even his solo compositions), and that the guitar really shines (showing how it is THE most essential distinguishing characteristic of early Genesis' music).<br /><br />Some reviewers and listeners, will find all this no better than the originals, offering nothing new, and so not really interesting - and I agree with the first part, but I love the originals and so am glad to hear their reproduction being done faithfully and pristinely. I like this much more than his earlier revisit (which is more interpretive, and uneven, and so, more like his solo work). This seems more serious, precise and earnest an effort perhaps. It is sonically great, and makes me wish the original Genesis albums could get such a refreshing/remastering treatment.<br /><br />Perhaps the best part though is that it makes me want to go back to the originals and appreciate them for what they were - adventurous, ambitious, creative, playful and passionate. Maybe it will inspire this for other listeners old and new as well. In that case it is a resounding success.that case it is a resounding success.
1439192812|5.0|As a one-time science teacher (now administrator), I have really enjoyed reading this book with my upper elementary child who is very curious about the world.  Great conversation starter if you want to talk about the world as we know it due to science.
B0071BGOJC|4.0|I am a lover of Ken Follett epics and could not wait for the continued saga of Maud, Gus, Fitz, etc but I am a little disappointed.  I still give it a 4 but the first book would have gotten a 6 if possible.

B007REV4T8|3.0|No spoilers in this review.<br /><br />If you saw the first James Bond movie, \\"Dr. No.\\" in a movie theater when it first came out....it was fifty years ago!<br /><br />I just saw Skyfall...and I did not think it was one of the best.<br /><br />Why? It was somewhat disjointed...there were many stretches where not much was going on...and the plot didn't make all that much sense in the long run. That being said, Daniel Craig is still one of the best Bonds (I think Connery was the best)..the familiar music is great...and it's still all in good fun. I don't regret seeing it.<br /><br />I'd say the weakness in this film was in the writing and editing.<br /><br />So should you see this movie? Sure. Go ahead. Like all the Bond movies there is great scenery, the acting is just fine, and everything is larger than life. There are lots of fights, there is lots of gun fire, there are lots of explosions, and there is a great chase scene.<br /><br />But if you are looking for a terrific story line, with lots of twists and turns, and where everything makes a lot of sense look elsewhere.
B0084YCKMU|5.0|Im already a Sherlock fan so needless to say I really enjoyed these short series.  I just about cried at the end when John Watson was having a heart to heart with his friend.  It was so true to character while still showing a different side of John.  The whole Moriati thing just wasnt wrapped up neat enough for me... I just didnt understand his psycho character. But other than that... LOVE LOVE LOVE two seasons where GREAT! Season three please!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Reflected in You was both an amazing and difficult book for me to get through. It had many of the same elements as Bared to You --the sexiness, the intensity, and the emotional drama... But it was also ten times more frustrating!<br /><br />To start with, Gideon began closing himself off. In Bared to You things were difficult for Gideon and Eva, but they communicated extremely well. Gideon's communication completely went out the window in Reflected in You. He was hiding things from Eva for seemingly no reason. It all comes together and makes sense in the end, but it doesn't change the fact that I was frustrated as hell for 98% of the book. That is the exact percentage by the way--I checked on my Kindle. Gideon hides a massive secret for the entire book. Eva is pissed. Eva's friends are pissed. I'm freaking pissed... I honestly just sat there wondering, \\"What happened to the amazing communication I talked about in Bared to You??\\"<br /><br />Gideon plays the entire book hot and cold. One minute he's confessing his never-ending affections for Eva, proclaiming that she \\"saved him\\" and among other things.. and the next, he's totally ignoring her. Cue hair pulling. It took so long for the truth to come out that I literally thought the story would just leave us hanging, and that annoyed me (though it didn't end up happening).<br /><br />Even though everything works out at the end, I feel like it wasn't enough to rescue my enjoyment of the book. I was pissed off and frustrated for too long. I still enjoyed Reflected in You--just not to the same extent as Bared to You. At around the 70% mark, I actually started noting down all the unanswered questions in fear that they wouldn't be resolved, and I wanted to be able to check back and remember whether or not they were. Luckily, I think all of my questions were resolved to some extent (some not satisfyingly so), but it just took too damn long.<br /><br />Reflected in You was the hot, steamy sex story I hoped it would be. Emotions are high, stakes are high, and two young people are struggling to make a chaotic, broken relationship work. It's intense, it's hot.. and it's frustrating as hell. Sometimes I was pissed off and wishing I'd just get some answers, and sometimes I was nearly brimming with tears. This book yanked me in a thousand different directions! The downside is that it did read like a bit of a filler book. In hindsight, not much actually happens. It's the same problems from Bared to You but different scenarios. Different ways for Eva to doubt Gideon's loyalty. Different ways for Gideon to feel possessive and controlling. The same way for them to reconcile again and again (sex, and more sex). On the bright side, Reflected in You was good enough to keep me hooked and I read it nearly in one sitting.<br /><br />Reflected in You was still hot and sexy and emotional, but I was looking for something new.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|I just got turned on to this show when Arrow started and Supernatural was on afterwards. It looked interesting and, of course, I had no idea what was going on. I watched about 3 episodes of Season 8 and thought I will get Season 1 and figure it out. It is really weird(a good weird) watching the beginning and the current. Let me tell you that I am a total fanatic in a hell of a hurry. I absolutely love this show and it grabbed me from behind from the get go and no let up on the grip. I stay up way too late watching. I cannot get enough of this one. I love the 1st season and my favorite episode is Skin where the shape-shifter turns into Dean. He is the ultimate smart ass and I identify with that. He has the best one-liners that I have ever heard in my life. The writing is fantastic and you would actually think the 2 actors are brothers in real life. They have such an obvious on-screen chemistry, such that I have never seen before. The chemistry was obvious from the get go. It also helps that the 2 of them are extemely easy on the eyes, let alone that they are really great actors and they make it look effortless. It is so addicting and what a wonderful addiction to have. I was busy doing martial arts when this one started so not being home I missed this one, thankfully getting them on DVD is just the best. Whether you are new to the series(as I am) or a fan from the beginning, there is no denying that this show is superb and sublime. I highly recommend this show to anyone who likes this genre. I would give it 10 stars if that were an option. The boxed set is great and I love the extras. The gag reel included is worth it in itself, seeing the goof ups and the humor. The music hooked me from the beginning too. The references they make with the dectective names is something that surprised me in that I actually get them. Impersonating priests with the names of Father Simmons and Father Frehley had me laughing my butt off, it was like I was born to watch this show. Get thisseries, you will not regret it.
B00866H7SS|5.0|The first thing I noticed about Bared to You was that the writing is phenomenal! This is one of those books where I feel like I need to quote every other line because they're all loaded with power, meaning, and intensity! And on top of that, the dialogue was hilarious! The main character Eva is brilliantly witty and her lines in particular had me cracking up!<br /><br />Since the synopsis doesn't really tell you much about the plot of the book, I'll go over it briefly. The story is about 24-year-old Eva. She moves to New York City to be closer to her wealthy mother and stepfather. She starts a new job and that's where she meets Gideon--an extremely wealthy, young bachelor. At first, he's only interested in sex, but he becomes so captivated by Eva that he wanders into the unknown: an exclusive relationship. But both Eva and Gideon have demons and traumatic pasts that threaten to tear them apart.<br /><br />So it sounds very Fifty Shades of Grey , right? Well, it's about a million times better. I feel like Bared to You is what Fifty Shades of Grey should have been. It has the same plot elements: controlling billionaire changes his playboy ways and falls in love with girl. But Bared to You is hot, passionate, sexy--NOT disturbing--, emotionally devouring, beautifully written, and all kinds of incredible... everything Fifty Shades wasn't (for me).<br /><br />You know what my favourite part is about Bared to You ? Eva isn't a blubbering idiot. She's not some silly naïve girl who says two words and just lays back while some controlling guy has sex with her. No. She takes control. She's witty, extremely intelligent, funny, and has a controlling interest in the relationship. Heck, the first time they had sex, she was on top. She initiated it. And even from the way Eva speaks, you can tell she's intelligent. She certainly knows how to hold her own amidst some playful banter.<br /><br />Eva and Gideon had both the most dysfunctional and most functional relationship I've ever read. Both these people are broken. They have dark, hidden pasts that haunt them day and night. For Eva, it means her self esteem is broken and shattered. For Gideon, it means he craves control and power. Put these two broken beings together and you get an intense, passionate chaos. But on the other hand, this is one of the few relationships I've read about where the couple actually communicates. Imagine that! They don't play games with each other. If one of them is pissed off, they'll say, \\"I don't like seeing you with another girl. It makes me jealous and uncomfortable.\\" If Eva gets frustrated and leaves, Gideon gets upset and says, \\"I don't like it when you run away. It makes me feel broken and alone.\\" PEOPLE, THEY'RE COMMUNICATING!!<br /><br />\\"We don't fight, angel. We just have to learn not to scare the hell out of each other.\\"<br />--Page 248, Bared to You<br /><br />Eva and Gideon voice their opinions, fears, hopes, dreams, frustrations, and anything else on their mind! If they're feeling it, they say it. They talk about going to couples therapy to work through their issues together. They sit down and have heart-to-heart talks. They work out the kinks in their relationship. So sure, Gideon may be a bit of a crazy, power-hungry control freak and Eva may have severe jealousy and self-esteem problems, but they know they have those issues and they work them out like a proper couple. Most of the time in books, the couple just plays mind games with each other and expects the other person to be a mind reader. This is not the case in Bared to You ! Talk about refreshing.<br /><br />And if it wasn't obvious, this book was HOT. Freaking hot. Unbelievably hot. One of the most intensely hot books I've read in a while.. and that's saying something!<br /><br />Despite my intense enjoyment of this book, I do have two issues, both centered around the fact that Bared to You felt more like a \\"part one\\" of one book rather than the first book in a series. There were a few things that were introduced in the book that never really got resolved. We meet Gideon's family, but nothing develops with them. We learn that Gideon clearly has some abuse or trauma in his past, but he never comes forward about it. It would have been okay if at least Eva made some sort of official declaration of acceptance of the fact that Gideon wasn't ready to talk about it, but I felt like the whole issue was just ignored. And finally, I wasn't completely satisfied with the ending. It wasn't bad, but I feel like it literally just got cut off mid-book. There wasn't an epic showdown or a huge resolution of some kind.<br /><br />I'm sure all my issues will be addressed in the second book, but I feel like there still should have been more of a wrap-up in Bared to You .<br /><br />Even so, this book was absolutely phenomenal. It was hot, sexy, emotional, intense, gritty, dark, and absolutely mind-blowing! It's safe to say I'm running out to buy the next book--Reflected in You--immediately!gs that were introduced in the book that never really got resolved.

B005I6EVUG|4.0|This verso case is definitely pretty, with a very pleasing texture to it.  It straps the kindle in fairly well and seems fairly secure and well padded, and while priced somewhat high is also made of quality materials.<br /><br />On the other hand the case adds a lot of bulk, and the lack of any sort of locking mechanism (strap, magnet, whatever) is definitely a big negative for something in this price range.<br /><br />If you're buying this case its most likely due to the aesthetics, and on that ground I think the case is a big success.  If it had at least some sort of locking mechanism it'd be five stars for sure.

B0083GQKQG|3.0|I read this book and loved it. It is extremely dark, but as someone who studied psychology I found it fascinating. The movie was not quite as good, but I think they did the best they could and I did find it entertaining. All of the actors are great in their respective roles, I just thought some of the story fell short. If I had not read the book prior, I'm sure I would have felt differently. Overall, if you are in the mood for a well done movie with a seriously dark theme, I recommend \\"We Need to Talk about Kevin\\".

1451695195|1.0|This book is extremely disappointing. I saw Dr Alexander on one of the early morning news shows and with his medical background, I felt that his account of his experience would be worthwhile.  On the show he highlighted the focal points of his heavenly journey.  Unfortunately this book does not tell you much more.  He could have written his story in a half page newspaper article.  The editing of the book is such that the publisher is trying to expand on the information using short chapters with a lot of three quarter blank pages bringing the book up to the desirable 200 page paperback format for marketing purposes.  I am happy the doctor survived his medical event but I did not learn anything from this book.  It is written in the same style as a boring medical scientific article which makes for very tedious reading.
B00062I6TO|5.0|It is hardly necessary to add to the unanimous praise already heaped upon this musical feast, but I can at least fill an important gap. Neither the Product Description or the Editorial or Consumer Reviews list the actual program. There are so many Strauss compendia out there that prospective purchasers need this information to avoid massive redundancy. Here is what they will get on this DVD: Accelerations Waltz; Peasants Polka; At Home With Us Waltz; The Dragonfly Polka (Josef); Die Fledermaus Overture; Artists Life Waltz; The Little Mill Polka (Josef); Hungarian Fast Polka; In a Viennese Park Polka; Voices of Spring Waltz; Pizzicato Polka; Csardas from Ritter Pazman; Little Chatterbox Polka (Josef); Jockey Polka (Josef); Radetzky March.<br />In my infancy as a classical music enthusiast, there was no greater interpreter of the Strauss repertoire than Clemens Krauss. Even that great Austrian maestro Herbert Von K didn't come close, and Willy Boskowski who turned the great orchestra into the \\"Vienna Pops\\" for his many Strauss potpourri vinyls proved to be not much more than a downward step on the ladder leading to Andre Rieu and his brash flamboyance. With Kleiber, as with Krauss, these waltzes, polkas and csardas are elevated to the level of masterpieces of the musical art, bursting with wonderful melodies, artfully constructed, brilliantly orchestrated, and expressing a wide range of human emotions as well as unique wit. I have never heard the VPO strings play more ravishingly, or its wind and brash sections more securely. Everybody in the Musikverein, both on and off the stage, are hugely enjoying themselves, not least the conductor. He displays almost a casual arrogance in his handling of the scores, doing as little as he possibly can, and yet the sound that emerges is pure magic, and it is superbly captures by the DG engineers. Brian Large also does a wonderful job with the camera, showing us precious glimpses of some of the peculiar instruments introduced into the orchestra for several of these pieces. One reviewer bemoaned the fact that it is not possible to award more than 5 stars to this disc. I am with him here.the orchestra for several of these pieces.

0446573027|4.0|David Baldacci's books have increased in publication and so has his list of heroes.  In this novel he introduces John Puller, a military investigator who has done tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.  He has a somewhat demented general officer father, and a brilliant nuclear physicist brother who is doing life for treason.  Like all of Baldacci's stories, it starts out with an incident.  Then we make the aquaintance of the main character.  Slowly we find out more about the brother and the father, and all of these things start to pique our interest as the plot unfolds.  Why was an entire family murdered in a systematic way in an out of the way place?  This is in a small town in West Virginia and in coal mining country. Of course there is a female counterpart in this investigation with Puller and her name is Samantha Cole.  Her life becomes an open book as we find out that she happens to be the sister of a socialite married to a coal baron.  Her brother is a sort of  damaged guy who knows the wrong people.  As the bodies build up and the exploration of the facts continue we find out about an abandoned WWII era bunker which no one has entered since the 1950s or have they?  There is much to fear as more information comes to the surface and the death toll will increase.

1401235417|5.0|Batman hardcover collection vol.1 (of the New 52), The Court of Owls. With the threat of impending death placed on both Bruce Wayne/Batman by a secret, legendary, and sinister society called \\"The Court of Owls\\" that supposedly is the real power behind Gotham City, The Bat is forced to mount an investigation into the truth behind the group he believed didn't exist. All the while, he must be wary of everyone around him, not quite sure whom he can trust and from where the promised assassin will arise. Vol. 1 collects issues 1-7 of the New 52 \\"Batman\\" title in a very lovely hardcover edition that includes the issue covers and a neat look at the script and pencil art.<br /><br />I have been a lifelong Batman fan, but I have to admit, I have read very few Batman comics. In fact, though I illustrate comics myself for GrayHaven Comics and do a more newspaper-style humor strip as well in the form of a webcomic, my comic book fanaticism is mostly limited to Disney and Star Wars. My love for the DC and Marvel superheroes is largely based on the big and small screens. However, I still am a passionate fan trying to delve into the comic canon a bit more all the time. That's why I was eager to check out this book. After all, my favorite superhero does happen to be Batman (not counting that adorable dreamgirl, Sailor Moon).<br /><br />Now, even though I am not well schooled in the comics version of these characters, I still read comics in general, so I have picked up stuff here and there. I knew about this big reboot, which is never something I'm too thrilled about (especially when costumes are changed or favorite characters tossed out), even if I'm not a reader. I have to say though, an interesting thing about the New 52 is that it is not a start from scratch kind of thing. Maybe that is never the case with comic reboots. This may be comforting for the long time fan. For a new comer, a reboot seems like the perfect time to come into something, but this really won't seem like a reboot to you at all. Batman's gone through a few Robins already, and now one is his own kid, if I picked up on that right. I didn't even know he'd had a kid in the comic canon! This is not a spoiler, either, this is just a bit about where the characters are in this alleged reboot. But, as I said, I am not coming into this from having read the comics before, so I'd probably notice all kinds of changes if I had. Most everything here seems pretty normal for me. Alfred, the Batcave, and everything else looks sound. There is slight, visible reference to Catwoman, Batgirl (apparently, the version I like, redheaded, traditionally costumed, and fully functional), and Joker and other villains, and a real treat is that one of the cars in the Batcave appears to the Burton films' Batmobile! But, enough about that. Point is, everything looks like the Batman I know and love, and reads like it too, or how I would expect it to. The art is gorgeous, by the way, and I am very picky on this. Not that I am that great of an artist (hey, I'm new to comics, I don't come near to this level, though I also do a far simpler, more cartoony style), but I can still tell if other work is good. What do I love about the art in this collection? Though it's as beautifully detailed as one usually sees in modern comics, the designs remind me, at least a bit, of some of the really great stuff we've seen from Bruce Timm and Paul Dini's animated series' and shows. Just a bit, but enough to make me really like this, as I generally have felt that comic art lately looks too much all the same and not really to my tastes much either. This is nice. This is gorgeous and refreshing, and should make fans of both the comics and the animated universes happy. But, I digress.<br /><br />Besides the art, the writing and the overall story here are also excellent. The conspiracy tale that unfolds in these pages is fascinating and even dark and creepy. It's a great read, and lots of fun! Though my budget has kept me away from comics for quite a while, I am very interested in reading more volumes of this. I'm very pleased to recommend Batman vol. 1: The Court of Owls to both classic fans and newcomers alike! It's still the Batman we know and love, and it's an excellent, beautifully illustrated story unfolding herein!om comics for quite a while, I am very interested in reading more volumes of this.

B008O9V4C2|4.0|This collection of songwriting is good. The guitar solos are really good. the arrangements are up to Donald Fagen standards. There are lots of creative moments in here from a musicians point of view. What lacks is having several good drummers to give different types of songs a more unique rhythmic feel. Most of the album has that southern Cal L.A. cool school sound. It can sound almost sterile at times. Many of the songs need a kick in spots during the verse turn arounds and the entries to solos and choruses. A lot of it sounds like a basic drum track with very little feel.A couple of different studio drummers would have given this album a great boost for sure. But the album is still good and the songs are arranged well.

B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This book isn't new to anyone but me really, but that's okay. I'm late to the scene. I get it.<br /><br />There's also a movie coming out about this one. I watched the trailer. It looks very NOT close to the book. Go figure.<br /><br />Anyhoo. Where do I start with this one? The first 30% of the book-that's how I gauge things on my Kindle-seemed to drag on for me. It's a front-loaded high fantasy, meaning there is a TON of information/world building thrown at you from the get go. Overwhelmingly so. So much so that I kept falling asleep while trying to read.<br /><br />But, if you can get past that, and I advise you should, you will be treated with a wonderfully developed tale of angels, demons, and humans, and a war all located in New York City.<br /><br />I've been trying to tell people for years that NYC is not a nice place.<br /><br />The pace and action pick up, and the little history lessons get dribbled in at all the right moments.<br /><br />Now, I have to warn you, there is a plot device in this book that turned my stomach sour. Really sour. Nearly vomiting sour. I wouldn't buy the next book in the series until I read every blurb for the other published books in this series to see if that plot device ever resolved itself. When I was satisfied, I purchased City of Ashes.<br /><br />Because of the slow start, and that disgusting plot device, I rated City of Bones 3.5 stars. (This could be because I'm totally in love with Jace. Who knows. You should read it and find out!)
0545425115|5.0|The entire series is incredible! The characters are some of the best part due to their development over the three books! I suggest reading this book twice because the first time is great for the plot, but the second read allows you to pay attention to the characters. The Epilogue at the end of the series left me feeling whole and satisfied. There was no loose string left. Suzanne Collins writes with such flavor and diction that easily catches the reader off guard, but in a good way. This book is a for sure must read!

I cannot wait to see what the third book brings, I just wish we didn't have to wait until May of next year. It is a great story and I really got into the characters and their individual story lines. I honestly liked this series almost as much as I enjoy 50 Shades of Grey.

B00029D0H4|3.0|This is the only toy I regret buying for my boys. Though I wouldn't hesitate to buy another car transporter (car carrier) I would not again pay fifty dollars. I was on a \\"no plastic\\" kick when I bought it. I thought it would last a lifetime and that made the price worth it.<br /><br />When it arrived it met my expectations, though I noticed one tiny knob used to hinge the upper carriage was not cast properly or had been broken a bit and paint was missing. Unfortunately, that made it easy for the upper carriage to come apart from the rest of the transporter. It is now in pieces while another car transporter (unfortunately made in China and made of plastic) is still being played with.<br /><br />If you are curious I looked at the other transporter and it has no name- only \\"Made in China\\". It was given to us from some friends as a toy they grew out of. It has a red metal cab, but the entire carriage is gray plastic. It is also slightly larger than this Siku.
158270208X|5.0|I love this journal more than any other I've had. It's inviting to open and write your thoughts and gratitude in. Every page has little quotes that are wonderful to read. It goes perfectly with the other books in the collection. I have them all. I read one or more everyday. The secret collection has helped me find inner peace and so much more. Thank you Rhonda Byrne
B008Q09K2U|2.0|The book does not flow. It is written largely in the first person through the eyes of the main character and is constantly interspersed with wisecracks which are mildly amusing in the begining but become annoying and disruptive as the story wears on.<br /><br />I also found the story to be \\"corny\\" and the plot unoriginal.<br /><br />The only other book I had read by the author was \\"The Charm School\\" which was captivating and thought provoking and I was disappointed by \\"The Panther\\" in comparison.
1439130833|5.0|I read this calender everyday. I can't wait for what tomorrow brings. You read it in the morning and it keeps your mind thinking all day about it. Makes you more aware of gratitude. It has everything from quotes to little games to line the universe up for you. Its just another way to keep the secret going everyday in your life.
B001QWBM62|5.0|Received as a present from a friend, I was expecting to buy sometime soon for a \\"found sounds\\" electronic project I am planing on doing. Nice to just use once i put some batteries in and not needing to upgrade firmware was a plus. And to my surprise the Zoom H4n ship with a 2gb kingston SD and Cubase 6 LE instead of a 1gb and 4 or 5 LE. Even though i have many SD cards laying around and use Live 8 it was a nice perk. Plastic case, windscreen, screw on mic clip adapter/handle are also nice. Cool that it's a guitar tuner and effect processor too with like 49 presets. be sure to set in on 4ch or monitor mode to be able to select the effects channel in menu. So easy to use but there are many tutorial vids on Youtube and out there online if you still need some input on how to use.

6304383827|5.0|This is another Jane Austen story. Emma is very likable and she seems to think she is a very good matchmaker. Loved the movie.
B008D19WBQ|4.0|I want to clear a few things up about this set...<br /><br />1. A lot of reviews I have seen out there really discount the quality, compare it to your DVD set, it's amazing.<br />2. The packaging is great, compared to the sets in other countries. They have treated the US well!<br />3. No other blu ray release contains extended episodes like some reviewers are saying.<br /><br />Get it it's worth it!
B000YIGNKE|5.0|This is one of my favorite Jane Austen novels and I especially like this PBS version. I received the merchandise in a timely manner and I am very pleased.
B003U4ZU7Q|5.0|I have watched the six years in about three weeks.  It is an utterly incredible show.  More moving and touching than any piece if media I have ever encountered in any form.  Its only competition is the reimagined Battlestar Galactica.  I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|I loved the music of \\"The Descendants\\".  It was perfect for the movie. I loved the CD, and play it all the time, when I am driving. Flipper
B008OTTRXU|5.0|I recently became a fan of her music she is cute and i really love her music so ill probaly buy more of her music
B009KYXEY6|1.0|I was so pumped when saw this CD on the shelf at the store and I had to choose between this born to die paradise version or the paradise version the difference being 7$ but I was a huge fan so I decided to drop the extra cash for the extra tracks only to find out they are not there... I mean what is going on here.  Yes I know that 7$ is not a ton of money but it was still a bait and switch and still no way to recover my money because the disk is open I mean honestly Lana this is just garbage.  I can tell you that I will not be purchasing any more of your CD's.  I mean it cracks me up so many record labels are complaining that people are illegally downloading music.  Then you go out and punish your fans that have actually purchased your CD.  I can tell you this is why people steal music because when they try to legitimately purchase it people screw over their fans... what the hell is that...<br />And her official site is silent on the matter... nothing not an apology not a whoops our bad nothing... just hahah I got your money now go stuff it... very poor form very poor...

B004SBX112|1.0|Would love to play the updated version, but can't. When I installed the update, it would no longer open. It goes to a black screen, then back to my menu/homescreen. IT TOTALLY BITES that an update would screw up a game that bad.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|This was a great movie. It teaches about consequences to our actions when it comes to our environment in a friendly way for children of all ages.
0316228532|3.0|I agree, it is difficult to not expect more HP excitement, but this book really was more dull than anything.  Perhaps if it had been trimmed 30-40 pages, it would have worked out better.  I remember a number of times wanting to skip ahead, get to the point, the interest... and until the very end there was really none of that.<br />JK Rowling does write well in that she is good at dialogue and description, but this just seemed to slog a lot for my taste.<br />Actually, I could see this becoming a lovely art movie with the right screenplay, and the right actors, one that would do well in the film festivals...<br />I hope Ms. Rowling publishes again, but tightens up the story flow a bit.
B008Y2IU12|5.0|It was a surprise that I enjoyed this movie.  After seeing so many versions of Snow White what else is there to say.  This was a surprise that I was not expecting.
0440246008|4.0|Lee Child's Reacher books are beginning to grow on me. The first one I read 'One Shot' was riddled with factual errors and I was not impressed. Deciding to give him another chance I picked on 'The Hard Way'. Lee writes as an American in the American idiom but does occasional make an error. In this case it was cheque instead of the American check but I can forgive that minor flaw. One of his bigger problems is lack of real research with regard to detail. Two I picked out at random were the printing of currency on a photocopier (which cannot be done as these machines are specially programmed to prevent such fraud) and the time it takes for land to be converted for production of organic vegetables. Not five years, Lee, but two. One other thing. Bird scarers are no longer fitted with shotgun cartridges but work on compressed air. They sound dull and nothing like the sharp crack of a cartridge. They can be loud though.<br />Otherwise the story read well. I particularly liked his technique of reversing the point of view of an Englishman in New York to that of an American in London; a jolly good effort at both.<br />I still have trouble reconciling Reacher's ability to live in one set of clothes without a bank account or credit card, toothbrush in pocket, with the real world. He always seems to have cash to spare. He must have enormous back pockets.<br />The plot line was believeable although some of the characterisation was flawed. I cannot believe in a Mercenary boss called Edward Lane. He sounds more like a novelist. In fact I've read two of his books and he's a far cry from the nasty sociopath that Lee portrays. But what's in a name? Perhaps Ed Lane will write Lee into one of his books in future. I know it sounds as if I'm blowing my own trumpet but I did have the plot worked out quite early on; it was pretty well telegraphed for me.<br />However, the book was enjoyable to read and I've now started on my third Reacher Novel 'The Enemy' where he is still gainfully employed by the American army. I'll report in due course but so far the omens are good.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I recently switched from iPhone to Android and had to start my game over!  Overall it is the same as the iPhone version, except for a couple of loading issues I have had.  I do not like that every time my phone's screen turns off (as part of my battery saver) it has to load the game all over again.  a couple of times when this happened it crashed and I lost my current level data.  That is really my only complaint.  Otherwise I still love it and am working on my 2nd run through!

B00846REIS|5.0|This book had me going to sleep most nights after midnight reading. Can't wait for part three. If you loved 50 shades you would love this book.
B00846REIS|5.0|After getting hooked on this genre from reading 50 Shades of Grey, I went to this title. There are certainly comparisons that would make you think the author read 50 Shades (she says she hasn't); but, nevertheless, I liked this book just as much. What I found I liked so much more,though, was that Eva was not so submissive like Ana. To be honest, Ana thought way too much in 50 Shades, and it got kind of old. Eva has spunk too, which gives the book some lift. I read the second book, and can't wait for the third.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|After reading 50 shades it made u look at books differently but this book definitely caught my attention after the first few chapters . I will definitely recommend this book.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I have always been a big fan of these books but I didn't like the cabin fever but this one made up for that one
B004CEUEWE|4.0|Ben Affleck is great, good supporting cast. Kept you entertained. Would certainly watch again. Good action movie, it won't disappoint you.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|A great Christmas movie. It is fun for the whole family! The story of a human (Will Ferrell) raised by elves at the North Pole. Is fun, modern, and a bit magical. Its a new holiday staple in our home.
B008XG1X18|5.0|works awesome since I'm never on my computer. sometimes freezes and I have to restart but that's about it so awesome
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This is hands down the best Christmas movie off all time. Pretty sure I could recite the entire thing. Everyone from kids to adults will be laughing the whole time! Definitely a holiday classic, buy it now!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was the last book of the trilogy and I was saddened to see it end.  I have been amazed at the imagination of the author.  These books were written for teens.  However, I am a retired 61 year-old woman who was completely enthralled with these books.  The descriptions of scenes made me feel as if I were a part of the life of the characters.  I was brought to tears with their emotions. I would recommend this book to people of any age.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I thought that it was a very good book!! Cornwell is back where she should be which is at the top of her field. I was disappointed with Port Mortuary RED MIST WAS PRETTY GOOD BUT THE BONE BED BRINGS HER BACK
B008FPOIT6|5.0|It is well written, smart and hooks you from the first page. It hooked me at the beginning and never let go. I reccomend to all.
B009A882D0|3.0|Okay not a huge fan of CCR, however their contribution to the classic rock scene cannot be questioned.The reason I purchased this particular C.D. is that it has many of their historic songs on it, and it covers nine of their best known albums.<br /> The way that these three C.D.'s are packaged is not the best, but I do like the way the booklet has been placed inside the package set. The sound quality on the first two C.D.'s is good but I have heard better.<br /> My question of WHAT! and the reason for my 3 star rating is WHAT happened to the third live C.D. in this set.Fantasy Record Company have in the past have had decent sounding C.D.'s. However they have dropped the ball on disc #3 in this set, when it comes to good sound quality of live performances. The sound quality is not terribly bad, but it isn't that good either. We as music buying customers should expect more for the money we have to pay out to buy classic rock C.D.'s these days.<br /> COME ON Fantasy Records I know you can do better!<br /> Overall not a bad C.D. if you can get it at a good price,only downer of this set beside the packaging is the sound quality on disc 3 should have been better.<br /> Keep on Rocking!
B000093BDX|5.0|When looking for a Beach Boy CD, I wanted one that had the most songs and all the favorites.  This fits the bill!  I just love this CD.  I exercise to it along with other CD's every day.  I also grew up listening to the Beach Boys and they are one of my favorite groups.  The songs remind me/and take me back to high school days. I would suggest that anyone who is a Beach Boy fan get this CD, you will be happy you did.
B009NOVCTM|3.0|I am not the biggest fan of The Rolling Stones, however I am a big fan of Classic Rock which includes The Rolling Stones. Evan If I am not the biggest fan of the group,  I still can very much appreciate their long lasting stay in the history of rock music. Don't get me wrong I do like a lot of their music.<br /> The sound quality on this C.D. is good however I think ABKCO Record Company could have done a better job<br /> I am satisfied with the songs chosen for this particular C.D.,that's the main reason I bought it, I knew about a lot of them. The art work on the cover is just COOL! and I liked it.<br /> Okay, why then 3 stars?<br />1) The sound quality could have been better.<br />2) Eight page booklet with most of it showing the song title and who wrote and<br />  published it.<br />3) This 3 C.D. set is RIDICULOUS OVERPRICED for what you are getting.<br /> I know the next question is why then did I buy it?<br />1) For the History The Rolling Stones music portrays in the Classic Rock scene.<br />2) The other reason is that my local record store had a decent sale on this C.D. at the time I bought it, and with my customer store discount I was able to get it at a price I could live with.<br /> Good C.D. if you want to fork the money over to buy it at it's enormous price. Even on Amazon.com the price is a little pricey, but just a little better then I have seen in other places. Be careful and GOOD LUCK!
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book was an easy read and was well worth the asking price. Flynn does another amazing job luring you in for another heart-pounding thriller. Loved it.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|I had high hopes for this second series from ken follett but I am majorly disappointed. The story just drags and does not hold up. I couldn't wait for it to be over and would have just given up but kept reading & hoping it would improve.
B0091REZMW|5.0|fun game lots of play time it keeps me busy at my lunch hour and before work. Would recomend to others.
B009AJD5E0|4.0|Thought the movie did a good job with showing off a new world. The script however... was not to impressive. Also this movie has one of the craziest scenes I have ever witnessed.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|This was the 1st J.Grisham book I've ever read, & it is the last one I will ever pay for!.  What a let down - any college student who is taking writting classes could have penned this book.  I've seen the movies based off his books & I know the movies are different, but if the movies were good the books would be so much better.  If I ever read another one, it will only be out the library for free.
B00006J3WH|5.0|This soundtrack reproduces the music in \\"Once More With Feeling\\", the musical episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It's fun to hear the entire \\"Parking Ticket\\" song (which is truncated a bit in the show). The CD is nicely filled out with music from the episodes \\"Restless\\", \\"Hush\\", and \\"the Gift\\" as well as something of a bonus with Joss's wife and Joss's demo of the song \\"Something to Sing About\\". If you are obsessed with Buffy, and particularly with \\"OMWF\\", this disc is for you.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Totally enjoyed the book, and it was great to see Paul Brenner back in action. My only criticisms are that John Corey's snide remarks and thoughts, while amusing in small doses, could be cut back - they eventually get in the way of the narrative. My other criticism is the name of the book is The Panther, but I'd venture the title character appears in only about 10% of the pages in the first person (although there's a lot of analysis about him by the other characters). It would have been nice if DeMille had fleshed him out a bit, as it appears from the little we learned that the Panther could have been a great villain in the mold of the Lion. Nonetheless, I always love DeMille's stories and characters, and would strongly recommend the book to his readers.
B006C3Q6GG|5.0|I've read the entire series several times and they just keep getting better.  The way that O'Brian is able to integrate fact with fiction and history with imagination results in a read that you can't put down.  If you like this type of writing I highly recommend reading \\"Gods and Generals\\", \\"The Killer Angels\\" or \\"The Last Full Measure\\"
B000FA5TTW|1.0|I purchased this book for my granddaughter because it was on a list of recommended reading at my granddaughter's Veteran Memorial Middle school's Accelerated Reader program.  She started reading this book and immediately commented that the language was foul and much to her credit indicated that she would prefer not reading this book.  I would not recommend this book to young people middle school age or younger.
1416550550|3.0|I did not enjoy this book as much as I had hoped. The reason was because the Author skipped around generations through the Chapters. That became very confusing trying to recall all the characters and their identiies. The more I read, the more exhausting it was to keep up with who and what the author was tryng to establish. If I had read it all in one night, I am sure it would have been easier. I read it over a span of a week and had to constantly go back and refresh myself of who and what .  Her writing was eloquent though,very good historian.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|The vibrancy of a recording demands joy in its performance. When Jagger takes the stage, we share the swagger of his cock-of-the-rock strut.  When Susan sings \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\" her own perseverance and dedication to her craft fill the room.  Despite the themed album,  the  diverse characters reflect a spectrum of emotional turmoil.  \\"As Long as He Needs Me\\" has lyrics unlikely to emanate from the lips of a young Nancy today.  Yet, the character embraces a vital role in another person's life, an act which forges the character of her life, as it would anyone willing to accept the responsibility for the needs of a loved one (or even unloved).  As anachronistic as the lyrics seem, Susan voice assures me that this is a worthwhile enterprise.  A character of considerably more life experience, Desiree evokes the sad emptiness of a long neglected relationship, a sadness hauntingly rendered by Susan's sullen tone in \\"Send in the Clowns\\". Susan does \\"haunting\\" exceptionally well as anyone who has heard her \\"Wild Horses\\" or \\"Mad World\\" can attest. I had a negative anticipation of this song at first, being enamored of Judy Collins' version.  The sobering reality of Susan's regretful tone, of her elegiac approach has made this one of my favorites on the CD.<br />  I never understood the magic of musicals, but perhaps it's because they capture common, passionate emotion on a universal cultural backdrop.  If you're like me and and you've seen fewer than three musicals, this album will put you center stage in each musical's cornerstone role.  After listening to these full, rich, nuanced renditions of dramatic stage roles,  I myself feel the urge to break out in song, to sing \\"Out Here On My Own\\" when the co-workers are at lunch, or to launch into \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\"  to defeat the ticker tape of world news recounting tragedy and disaster.<br />  When someone loves what she does, when her energy is consumed by the nuances of her profession, and when you can appreciate her work independent of your own preferences, then you begin to understand the power of Susan Boyle.<br />. Performing stage roles are what Susan was born to do, no doubt, but I wouldn't mind a little Mad World like pop song with album number five. : )
0399157565|5.0|The Bone Bed was yet another great\\" Scarpetta\\" novel  Patricia Cornwell never lets me down.  The \\"Scarpetta\\" series is my all time favorite.
B0041KVZ1I|2.0|Obviously this album is a classic. It's my favorite album of all time, but the new 2012 vinyl edition sounds like an old record I borrowed from my uncle.  I am just getting into vinyl, but all my other new vinyl sounds miles above this. I don't know whether I got a dud or if they're all going to be this hissy and pop filled.  hopefully they fix the problem before they release a mono set. I only bought this because they didn't do it in mono.  Guess  I'll stick with my mono cd set until then.<br /><br />After a few days, I want to update this review.  I took the album to a friend's house and listened on his $2K VPI turntable with $6K McIntosh Tube Preamp (I have a $600 vintage Thorens turntable and a $50 Rolls preamp for now), and the album sounded a bit better, but there was still obvious noisy vinyl under that amazing music.  Then I cleaned the album with his VPI vacuum record cleaner.  Listening again at home, it is not as bad as it was the first time I listened, but there is just a noisy quality to the whole thing, especially between songs, and at the end of the sides it's positively horrible.  Just think about the end of \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" and how it's supposed to go dead silent, but instead there's just this noise as the needle goes to the middle and then the same thing in the 10 seconds between \\"The End\\" and \\"Her Majesty\\" - NOISE, and not just typical vinyl noise.  This album is going back to Amazon in hopes of getting a better copy the next go round - though from other reviewers I have doubts that it will get better.  I have also gone ahead and bought the UK version from Amazon.co.uk.  For $10 more you can get the UK issue - not that we should have to!<br /><br />One more update... I received the EU pressing from Amazon.co.uk and it sounds so much better, so much quieter.  I actually hear what seems like the master tape instead of the new vinyl in the background.  I will probably buy more of the EU pressings and cross my fingers that the problems are fixed before they release the mono set.
0345442970|5.0|this book came on time and was in good shape. I love to learn about qui gon jin jedi history.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Grisham is following the same pattern that many successful authors do, in that his recent plots ramble and at times barely make sense.<br />I found this book not only boring, but frustrating to read because of all the plot distractions.  It seems he was struggling to fill the<br />necessary pages. In my opinion, it was not really worth wasting my time or $ on.
0151003084|5.0|This is good fun for anyone who appreciates good illustrations and a dark sense of humor. This is an alphabet book with a morbid twist.

B00006AUIG|1.0|This one was a let down as I thought it would be really good....NOT.It was really a let down and kinda stupid story. That chair on the cover really had no place in the movie. I had thought of making a purchase of another that the trailer looked as creepy as the exorcist but that had a low rating and not good reviews, but that lookes even better than this to me, and that was called the \\"The Posession\\". I think I should have stuck with my instincts and followed my own advice and got that instead.....looked scary to me.Save your money on this one.

B008EK91XU|4.0|This book is based around Ian's comeback and extends into his life.  Very readable and read it in a 2 or 3 days. It helped me to understand better the person he is and the pressures that he faces. Yes I would recommend it to others.
B0085TKAW6|4.0|A very moving family drama during the most dreadful time in history, the author does not hesitate to tell it like it was, and it was an echo of the stories my parents told us about living through those times, very real and terrifying. A great history lesson.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I enjoy this authors work and have read all his work. This book did not disappoint and even though it was short it felt as though it was complete.  I enjoyed reading on the forgers art, that each article has an awareness to it and that awareness can be used to base a copy that is same but different. Yes I would like to read a longer book based in this world but was not at all disappointed with this novella.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|And like all comic movie franchises with no exception outside Men in Black 3 (but MiB 2 was horrible, so it makes up for it), Chris Nolan's Batman trilogy ends with a massive disappointment. With the only amazing acting performance by the ensemble cast as this movie's only redeeming quality, the movie itself it's an absolute mess full of plot holes and nonsensical scenes after scenes. It starts 8 years after the Dark Knight, as it seems that Bruce Wayne have quit being Batman as soon as the death of Harvey Dent. Which tells us he was only Batman for around a year or less and then goes into retirement? As poorly the movie started, it ends even worse as Batman drags an unstable neutrocore on the Batwing, as it drags and knocks into everything in sight. This is movie so flawed, which saddens me because how good Batman Begins and the Dark Knight was. An atrocity finale for such a promising start of this trilogy. Pure garbage. Not even going to buy it on sale for $5. Highly not recommended!<br />Again, I'm giving it 1 stars only on how terrific the acting was from the entire cast.

B00846REIS|1.0|I normally don't leave reviews but I use them when determining what book to read next.  I have been misled with this one.  Were my expectations too high?  First of all, I am not sure what the point of this book was.  The plot is boy and girl meet and engage in a fast relationship with little depth, with girl becoming constantly jealous and running away to have guy follow her and make things all better with sex (again, no depth).  This was essentially an account a hallow relationship.  Not sure if my expectations were too high and I just missed what others read, but I just don't see how there is any basis for another book (as there really was no reason for this one, other than the literary porn).
B007A4SDCG|5.0|A great book if you have reservations about anything holding you back. Shows how to move forward and push through your fears to get in touch, or back in touch with your creative self. Highly reccomend it.
B00863DOS8|3.0|Both Castles & Dreams and Paris Moon were recorded on a much better night, if you know what I mean.<br />Also, there are fewer songs than on these older DVDs, and some sound a little slower and less inspiring. There is not a whole lot of additional material either. It is still a big enjoyment to see & hear the great master of guitar. But if you look for a real treat,  go see them live. Their performances are the whole another world. You can see traces of it in Castles & Dreams DVD, but not on this one.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed the book and I am thinking about getting the next in the series. I was able to read this on my kindle fire.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Great book won't wait to start reading the next, highly recommended, I saw the series before I read the book and as usual reading was way better
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|There were so many different roads the writer could have chosen, why the worst one?  The book was extremely boring compared to the first two. It dragged on and on without getting to the point and just when I thought its getting good, it goes downhill. So disappointed. She made the main characters unlikable, the romance between Katniss & Peeta and Katniss & Gale never blossomed into anything remotely romantic ....maybe its one of those books you gotta read and reread to understand
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is one of those series that you can't put down.  The characters and world suck you in and the suspense of their story won't let go.  They're written exceptionally well and the characters feel alive and believable. Here's hoping for a 6th installment soon.
0307463745|5.0|Rework is a book by 37Signals founder, Jason Fried. Mr. Fried also writes The blog Signal vs Noise as well as being a regular contributor to INC. magazine. Mr. Fried's company 37 Signals is privately owned, the only outside investor is Jeff Bezos from right here, Amazon. The software and apps made by 37 Signals are fantastic, and unique.<br /><br />Rework is written like a blog. The advice is unconventional, but it s all battle tested. A different way to approach business by very special entrepreneurs.<br /><br />My top takeaway? Bootstrap your business and strive to make money beginning day 1. Not an easy task, not impossible either. 37 Signals has done it. I highly recommend the 37Signals blog to all small business owners and entrepreneurs. And, it's free.<br /><br />Good luck with your investments and all your businesses! It isn't easy to be a successful entrepreneur. I do appreciate solid advice and feedback like I find on Mr Fried's blog and in their book Rework and their ebook Getting Real. Getting Real is also available on their site and is also free.

B008CLI4N4|5.0|First box set ever bought. Good show to watch and show to other people. Have gotten alot of people hooked on it cause of this.
B009YQJ322|5.0|I heard good things about this movie, and now I see why. It got right to the point and gave us what we wanted; a good ol' fashioned shoot-em-up action flick. It's much better than the 1995 Stallone version. Judge Dredd is very sinister, yet bad ass. While investigating a homicide in the 200-story slum tower block Peach Trees, Judge Dredd and rookie Judge Anderson are locked in by Ma-Ma. (Ma-Ma is the dealer of an addictive new drug called SLO-MO) They must fight their way thru the building and execute Ma-Ma's men. Judgment is coming. I highly recommend DREDD!!!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The premise is great--a man convicted of money-laundering is in jail, half-way through his 10-year term.  He uses his get out of jail card by identifying the killer of a Federal judge.<br /><br />From there it gets both interesting and confusing.  Grisham is untouchable in creating page-turners, and this one fits that pattern.  The only problem?  He leads us through several blind chases before letting us in on 'secrets' most of which require a certain level of belief-suspension to make it work.<br /><br />Yet, even as we are led around blindly, the plot becomes predictable, and the ending was less than satisfying (spoiler alert!).  It is the usual, main character ends up in the Caribbean smoking a cigar on the beach with his woman scenario.
B0058VW36U|5.0|My children (ages 8 & 5) are the ones that bugged me to download it for them. . .once I did, they've had a blast with it!

B005FJ7EIC|4.0|A very good movie! It's a coming of age movie with vampires.  The plot is vaguely similar to the road.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I came to work early with this album. Put in on the computer and was in heaven listening to it. Students who come to my classroom early, I shushed as they came in. When it was over, they said \\"play it again\\". They LOVED this music. This was HS students!!! They loved this album. Susan's voice wins over everyone.

B007EE4XKI|5.0|This is such a great read from beginning middle to end!  The whole book tells multiple stories that draw the reader in and gives you a glimpse into the lives of past tng characters and new ones as well.<br /><br />I couldn't put this book down and when I did I hated that I had to do it!<br /><br />Really looking forward to the next one in a couple of weeks!<br /><br />I try not to give anything a way to others that have not read this great book yet, again a great mystery, thriller and action all into one!!

B0007M8HTW|4.0|If with the previous album [[ASIN:B000002696 Bitches Brew]] Miles Davis established gritty fusion as his new sound, 1970's JACK JOHNSON marked a refinement of this style. \\"Right Off\\", the first track of this collection of two ~25 minutes jams written for a film on the old-time boxer, immediately provides an electric basis. One hears John McLaughlin's furious guitar licks against a rhythm section of Michael Henderson on bass and Billy Cobham on drums, and only over two minutes in does Davis appear on trumpet. From there on, however, Davis does dominate the show. Initially he's just straightforwardly smoking, playing off against McLaughlin especially. Eventually, however, producer Ted Macero contributes some studio wizardry that makes Davis' horn more ambient. It's important to note that everything on this album is heavily edited, but such stitching is generally invisible and much less intrusive than BITCHES BREW. Finally, McLaughlin and Henderson solo again, and we finally hear a decent amount of electric organ from Herbie Hancock.<br /><br />If \\"Right Off\\" ranges all over the place, the second track, \\"Yesternow\\", can risk monotony with the endlessly repeating bass line dominating its first part. The solos over it, however, are quality. Davis' initial appearance is of a lush and mellow kind more reminiscent of his mid-1960s bop than recent efforts. About halfway through, we hear a snippet of Davis' earlier album [[ASIN:B00006GO9Q In a Silent Way]] which Macero inserted as a bridging segment. The second half of the track features a completely new ensemble, many from BITCHES BREW, with Sonny Sharrock providing a second guitar and Bennie Maupin playing bass clarinet. Here Davis' trumpet approaches a rhythm instrument, briefly giving a very wide space for the other instrumentalists. The last six minutes or so of the track are almost pure funk, with one guitar playing wah-wah and the other straight.<br /><br />I've decided to give this album four stars because it does seem somewhat less substantial and varied than the releases preceding and following. However, this is a very entertaining effort, and may provide a path into Davis' fusion period for those who think BITCHES BREW is too noisy and convoluted (though IN A SILENT WAY works even better).m somewhat less substantial and varied than the releases preceding and following.

B0072OFM28|3.0|This series is interesting but not near as much &#34;eye popping&#34; fun as the other two Spartacus series. Lawless seems a little listless in her resurrection.
0345529057|5.0|I was shocked to see so many 1 star reviews. It appears that most are for the price of the kindle version (which I agree is ridiculous). For those of us that still love a paper copy of a book, this is a steal! The books are well written and long which makes you feel like you got your money's worth.<br /><br />If you already watch Game of Thrones on HBO, you will love the books. I personally feel the books are a little better than the tv show. (I know in most cases the books are way better than any movie or tv show, but the tv show is so well done and stays true to the book. The books go hand in hand with the tv show).<br /><br />The only negative point I have is only about the Amazon shipping. The box was too big for the boxset so, during shipping the boxset got one of its corners smashed in. Therefore, I cannot put all 4 books back into the boxset. (Not the biggest deal)

B005LAIHZE|1.0|This movie is HORRIBLE. I read the book, which had been thrown in the green metal round thing at the bottom of my tree by a human wearing old, smelly clothes out of fashion years before I was born, who was sipping on a latte. I hated every minute of it. It made me wish I hadn't learned what letters mean. I was persuaded to go see the movie in the theatre against my better judgement. Believe me, non-sentient squirrels are the worst at picking movies to go see. Terrible. Even worse than the book. At a certain point the movie makers said \\"Screw the book. Let's just end this however we want.\\" Do not waste your nuts on this one. Nuts, of course, are squirrel money.
B008BIZ06M|2.0|Bob Rock has ruined too many bands that he's produced for. See also: Metallica, Bush. Take a talented act and process their music until it's as generic and mainstream as it can get, and alienate all their previous fans that made them famous.<br /><br />I've been a giant Offspring fan since I was a growing up in Southern California. Since I got Ignition on cassette tape. Every time a new album came out I'd play it for months in my car or on my stereo.<br /><br />They have completely lost their edge, and they continue to make excuses for why their sound is changing. The parodies aren't funny on this album, they're annoying. Even the harder songs have the most generic lyrics imagineable. Usually on their latest albums they at least have 4-5 solid songs, but even the best on this album are seriously lacking compared to past work.<br /><br />I really hate seeing my favorite bands take a slide like this. Rise and Fall was also just as much of a dud. Next time I'm just going to download a torrent for a smell test before wasting my money on a turd like this.<br /><br />The few high notes on this are Slim Pickens, Dividing by Zero, and Dirty Magic (which still isn't anywhere nearly as good as the original).<br /><br />You can't listen to any of their first 6 albums and then say this one is anywhere close to being on par. Other bands are finally listening to fans and ditching their mid-career sound for the original music that launched them. Metallica fired Bob Rock, hired Rick Rubin, and released their best offering in over a decade. Megadeth did the same. Many bands seem to go through these cycles, but I'm really, really hoping Offspring's isn't as long as the others.<br /><br />Get back to punk and stick to it. And for the love of God fire Bob Rock. There's a reason why Jim Carrey's dramatic movies suck, because he's a comedy actor. Stick to what you know. I'm going to go listen to Pennywise for a few months to cleanse this album from my ears, so I know what it's like to hear bands that stick to their roots.ar bands that stick to their roots.

1451696191|5.0|This is a book for the nostalgic side of you. At first, I was a little concerned that it was made up of journal entries. I got over that fast. This is a great story with memborable characters and moments. A lot happens to Charlie and his friends throughout the book. If you allow yourself to be open to it, you feel like you're going through all the experiences and emotions along with them.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the television show \\"The Wonder Years\\", there's a good chance you'll enjoy this book.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A great read. I couldn't put the book down and read it in 2 nights. I would recommend this book to any Grisham fan.
0156027321|2.0|I thought this book was boring. I understand the necessity of giving the reader some background on the main character, but this case may have been a little excessive. I kept reading because I thought if Pi reached the water things would pick up. Once in the ocean, the story was only interesting enough that I was able to finish the book.<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT***<br /><br />I like those Nature programs on PBS and I found the way the author had the animals behave on the lifeboat very interesting.<br /><br />The island that Pi and Richard Parker came upon was also a highlight.<br /><br />The end was a little twisted. Pi gives an alternate version of what happened in his lifeboat. The author may have been trying to be thought provoking, but I ended up being disappointed. I felt like I forced myself to read through the entire book and the story might have actually been made up.

This is a different kind of sound than you would normally expect from Yanni, but the more you listen to it the more it \\"grows\\" on you.  I have loved Yanni's music for more than 20 years and this CD is no exception.  Some say this isn't typical Yanni, but I like the change.  Change is good!

0525958002|5.0|Have been a duranie for 30 years with John being the one I favored, that being said, I found this book to be very good.  I read mainly autobiographies and biographies because I like to find out the real story, and this book did exactly that.  He takes you from his birth to where he is today with intricate detail, you get a real feel for who he is, what/where he came from.  I tore through this in a matter of days because I liked finding out who the real person is, but also, he kept it fresh and entertaining.  All in all, excellent book, if you were of age in the 80's, you will be satisfied with this.  Note, I don't think there is any love loss between him and Andy, just from a couple of lines in book, you get a slight chill from the tone.  Overall, I got the feeling he is happy and at peace with himself, which is all any of us can hope for.  Enjoy(especially my fellow duranies)!
B0091REZMW|2.0|I almost liked this game. But I got bored with it in just about 10 minutes. It would be much better if there were a fun story with it. On my Kindle fire HD the pictures are very small but you can pinch to zoom and I do like that. I almost gave it 3 stars because if you are happy with just hidden object pictures then it is ok...but I get turned off when it is not clear what I am looking for...that fried chicken looks roasted to me and what they call music notes I call sheet music. I dont like the game but I am sure some do. its just blah to me.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|My son and I both love this game. He's ten and I'm thirty-five, so you can see it appeals to different ages. You get to use your creative side to decorate your space however you want it-from a sports theme to a dainty tea shop and everything in between. It's lots of fun!
1451696191|5.0|This novel by Stephen Chbosky is garunteed to pull at your heart strings and make you remember all of the pain and akwardness of your time in high school. The story is written in letter/diary style from the main character, Charlie, to an unknown character. Charlie is brutally honest about every experience he has during his freshmen year in high school including meeting his love Sam, her homosexual stepbrother and all of their closest friends. At first the story seems boringly sweet and typical but by the end you will be in tears from a perfect twist of an ending that will make you hurt for Charlie and wish you were his friend. This is one of my favorite novels.
B005M2V2K8|5.0|My daughters are addicted to cats but our cats really don't want anything to do with them. I bought them each one of these adorable little Cashmere kitties for Christmas. I was only going to see how much they liked them and then hide them for Christmas day but they haven't let them out of their sight! They're cute, soft and just the right size for their little 2 year old hands. I have already had to toss them in the washing machine due to them being white and being dragged all over the place. They were washed on the delicate cycle and then I used the blow dryer on them. I could see putting them in the dryer but you would need to put them in a protective bag so their eyes won't get all scratched up.<br /><br />They love them so much that I have purchased another set in a different color to give them for Christmas.

1936608618|5.0|I was so excited to receive this book, I am an endurance coach and a runner hoping to do Tri's soon.  This book covers it all running, biking, swimming, strength and condtioning, mobility, nutrition, hydration, training programs, everything you need. The visuals are stunning, full color photos demonstrating correct technique and skills and drills to improve technique. It is very user friendly and so well written even a complete novice could follow it.  I have a book shelf full of training books but this is by far the most comprehensive. I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in improving their quality of life through fitness and health.  It is also hugely beneficial for the seasoned athlete, effecient, smart training is the wave of the future no more junk miles, no more injury producing long slow distance. Get this book it will revolutionize your training!

B009YX02T8|3.0|I am a Twilight SOUNDTRACK fanatic. I loved the books, was indifferent to most of the movies and I'm STILL ticked about the fact that they picked Kristen Stewart for Bella. Seriously, a clump of mud would have been more passionate and expressive. ANYWAYS! The soundtracks have always been unbelievable; this one is just okay for me. A lot of the songs (including the much anticipated Green Day) seem to just drone on. The same four words repeated over and over again do not count as song writing. It's funny because the first two or three minutes of the Green Day song, I was thinking, \\"Yeah! This is awesome, it kind of reminds me classic Beatles.\\" but then it just keeps going on and on, and your four minutes in, and five minutes in, and you find yourself contemplating hanging yourself with your strawberry licorice. It's not all awful but it most certainly not great. I'm all for artists expressing themselves and dark music but this just bored me; the songs seemed to mush together. I really don't know what to say about it but \\"meh\\". Now I am droning on and on... Have a great day!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|The only issue that I have with this format of this game is that you cannot access the special rooms, like blackout or tournament.
B008KW43TE|5.0|I loved every minute of this album..constantly on repeat!! Frank Ocean is the type of artist music has been missing. He brings a breath of fresh air and creative lyrics and sounds to us music lovers! It's safe to say that real R&B is back!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I'm an SK fan from way back, but I haven't cared much for some of his more recent efforts.  Character development and plotting are his strong suits and they are on full display here.  Really enjoyed this one - a 'page-turner.'  Nice to lose myself in a King novel again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft PE is very good, not to par with PC version or X360, but still acceptable. Of course I do wish that people with a keyboard could bind the controls to it, not just the Xperia Play. Touch controls are quite slippery, but improved with a larger screen.

B001GCUO1Q|5.0|I have been a fan of X-Men since i was a kid. I liked the first 3 movies pretty well, especially the 1st one. This one, however, is far beyond the first 3. It is a little different from the others. There is more drama, and a little more downtime. The story develops well, and that's the key to creating a memorable movie. The origin of several characters is explained in Origins. The acting is also quite well done. This one probably ties with First Class as the best X-Men film.
0385344333|3.0|While A Wanted Man was Jack Reacher and he did perform well, it was not the best of the Reacher series.  It was wordy and took too long to make a point and develop the story line.  It would have been better at 300 pages vs 600. However, I will buy the next Reacher novel.

After they return home marriage, love, jealousy, and betrayal threaten to tear the family apart.<br /><br />This is a very powerful film. It has action, drama, comedy, romance, and suspense. It's very well rounded. The acting, score, and cinematography are excellent as well. This movie won the academy award for cinematography in 1994. Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins have done many great movies, but this is one of the best. It's so very dramatic and incredibly powerful. It definitely tugs at the strings of your heart. It would be a shame to miss this wonderful film.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Visually it's a beautiful film, but the plot line didn't add up or truly tie in to the first Alien film. Also a little slow.
B001NLCBJI|4.0|Bob and Charlotte are 2 Americans in Tokyo. Bob is a movie star in Tokyo to shoot a whiskey commercial, and Charlotte is tagging along with her workaholic photographer husband. Bob and Charlotte meet in a hotel bar one lonely night, and they hit it off. They have a great adventure in Tokyo and discover new possibilities for their lives.<br /><br />This movie is very unique. It has a very roller coaster like vibe. One minute you're feeling lonely and down, then all of a sudden you're at a night club or an arcade or singing karaoke. The two characters are both very different, but find common ground and become close. This movie also reminds us that life has endless possibilities, to seize the day, and not to take what we have for granted. It's not for children. There is some explicit content in it, but it's a great emotional movie for a mature viewer that wants to watch something different.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Wicked has been around for quite some time and my husband and I finally had the opportunity to see it on Broadway. We loved it. Great show!
B00319ECGK|5.0|The Matrix is one of the most well known films of all time I think. It had groundbreaking special effects, good acting and an original story. Everyone flipped out when they saw the special effects in this film. We probably thought it couldn't be any better. We were wrong. They put it on a Blu-ray disc. There are many Blu-ray transfers that don't quite get upgraded very well. The Matrix is an amazing Blu-ray transfer. Everything about this legendary movie is better now than ever before. If you don't own this movie you should get it on Blu-ray. If you do have this movie, but not on Blu-ray; you should get it on Blu-ray.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|Loved it. Hank goes through a lot of ups and downs, and they keep it fresh. On to the next one!!
B0013LL2Z2|5.0|Humanity lives in a confined city underground where the life span of the average person is around 30 years. After time runs out each person must give their life to the cycle of rebirth. Logan and a young woman decide that they don't want to do that. They escape the city and discover a civilization above ground that has been ruined. They realize that they were being held captive in an experiment in hedonism.<br /><br />This is a classic film. It has great costume and set design, as well as a very shocking story. I remember being shocked when I first saw this film. Even today it still blows me away. It's an older film, but it has stood the test of time. The Blu-ray version looks even better than the DVD. It's a must have for any Sci-fi fan.
0857860801|5.0|just like the YouTube videos, this book is a great laugh and is totally worth buying even tho it had to come from overseas
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Like many trilogies, The Matrix has a killer beginning and a showstopper ending. The middle is a bit weaker. That is true for a lot of trilogies. Lord of the Rings, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and Darkman..... just kidding. Even though it's a weaker movie it has some good points. The action in Reloaded is awesome, and the fight scenes get pretty intense. It just amounts to a lot of running around, with less drama and substance. I guess to accomplish some epic you do have to run around a lot. Neo couldn't save the world if he sat around all the time. So he runs around a lot, and this movie is where he does it. I do like that the enemy has multiplied and there being an infinite number of Agent Smith's. Like I said, this is the weakest Matrix film, but it's still very solid.
B009FZFONO|5.0|are you kidding me?! super easy to download and besides, it's 'the walking dead'! what more is there to say? :D
B0001BKAEY|4.0|After seeing The Matrix one would think, \\"oh my god, this can't end well\\". It does, but I think it could have been better. The epic fight scene at the end is what movie legends are made of. The invasion of Zion is awesome, and it's an important part of the story. It stresses the urgency and importance of what Neo and the others are fighting for. The one complaint I have is that many of the characters that were key in the 1st 2 films were kind of ignored a bit here. I know that things are beyond control of Morpheus and Trinity, but they played a surprisingly smaller role than I expected. That being said. This movie had action out the wazoo and plenty of drama. It didn't disappoint, but it could have been better. Revolutions is a worthy conclusion to this trilogy any way you look at it.
B0013V2UU8|4.0|Used with Lego people, housing, cars, and streets for an Adult training exercise, ...Seems to be working, keeps adults playing.
B003EYVXUU|5.0|This is a remake of a foreign film called Let the Right One In. I honestly think that the original was a bit scarier. This film isn't as dark and scary as the older one. It is a very good movie though.<br /><br />This film is about a boy that gets picked on a lot at school. Life is very hard for him, and he feels lonely much of the time. One day he befriends a girl living in a nearby apartment. She keeps him company, and gives him confidence. She also puts an end to the bullying he is suffering from. There is something not right about this girl. He learns that she is a vampire. Her secret shocks him, but he wants to stay with her regardless.<br /><br />This is a pretty cute love story about two children. It also has a heavy helping of violence and darkness. I really enjoyed it. It does have a depressing vibe about it, but it's a different take on the vampire theme. It explores the love between a vampire girl and a human boy. They want to be together forever, but he will grow old while she remains a young girl forever. It's kind of sad. Despite the depressing theme, Let Me In is a very entertaining and unique movie to watch.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It seems by the last couple Grisham novels he is back.  For a while, his books were not that great.  But this book grabbed me right away and I finished it quickly!
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. I was unable to see it in the theater so had to wait for the release on DVD. The movie had not received the best ratings but I was still excited to see the movie for myself. I wanted to see what Ridley Scott had been able to put together as a type of \\"prequel\\" to the Alien movies.<br />After watching the film, I would rate it  a 7.5 out of 10 - I wanted it to be better.<br /><br />I felt like there was so much of a story to tell that the movie was edited down too much - maybe would have been better to release in 2 movies or made a longer film. The action/suspense part of the movie was alright, although I didn't have any \\"jump out of my seat\\" moments I was expecting.<br /><br />I watched through some of the extras including the deleted and alternate scenes. Two of the deleted scenes should have been left in the movie to help tell the story or at least tie it together a little better.<br />I felt like the characters in the movie all of a sudden came to a conclusion on the true meaning of what was going on without really explaining how they came to that conclusion. One of the deleted scenes filled in the holes of the characters thought process.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the movie and would recommend it as a movie that you should buy or at least rent.<br />With the price I got on the 4 disc set - no reason not to buy!
B007UXSPK2|4.0|This movie has great action and terrific scenery and the acting isn't too bad either, but the movie is way too long and the plot is not realistic.<br />I found it hard to engross myself in something that is unbelievable. The plot is one step above a comic book story. However, if one can kill a<br />couple of hours watching a movie, all can't be bad. This movie should not be on your A-list of movies to watch. It should be on your B-list...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so much fun i you should so try it. Dont worry about what other people say its you own appinion.
034580404X|2.0|WOW so many issue's and not enough time nor room to get into all of them but I will do my best. First I will say I am only rating this 2 stars(being very generous)due to the fact that the ONLY good thing about this book was Christian PERIOD. He was a very HOT Dom who unfortunately was not strong enough as a man(ironic)to embrace who he is and what he desired and needed in his life. Besides his sex appeal he did have a good kind heart and he is the only reason I was able to finish this trilogy, Albeit, it took me MONTHS to finish which has never happened to me before as I usually will finish books in less than a week.<br /><br />Issue's:<br />1)I take such personal issue with the author for insinuating that Christian was into BDSM due to his tramatic upbringing, in essence making all uneducated vanilla's out there think there must be something psychologically with us that are in the lifestyle! Shame on you Ms. James, you have no idea the damage you have caused with your uneducated views! You should have left BDSM out of your books entirely and it would have been just fine being called regular erotica instead!<br />2)Ana- interesting how she is supposed to be this very naive young women who in truth is a very cunning manipulator, not to mention her selfishness was disgusting. Ana was a walking mass of confusion, contradiction and just plain spoiled. Ana is supposed to be head over heels for Christian but instead of trying to learn/educate herself about his lifestyle she does everything in her power to change him to what SHE wants. Sorry but last time I checked love is unconditional and it is a give and take on eachothers needs<br />but she succeded and ended up making Christian pretty much the sub and her the Domme!! What a joke! NO TRUE DOM would EVER allow someone to top him! So many issue's with Ana! Again not enough time to mention them all.<br />3)The grammer drove me insane and I felt like I was reading from the view of a 12yr old!! The constant use of the wordJeez was enough to make me want to throw my kindle out the window!!<br />4)The whole trilogy was sooooooo unbearably dragged out and redundant on so many parts it was truly exhausting and by 1/2 way through the 2nd book it truly was a chore to even continue reading. I literally skipped many many chapters throughout the whole series just to get through.<br /><br />At very best I would say this would have been a decent run of the mill erotic romance. There was nothing spectacular about their love story in the least. For all you vanilla's out there, please do not think this is an adequate view of BDSM, please take the time to do some research and educate yourself as this does not even begin to show how a TRUE D/s relationship is.
1416950176|4.0|Thus book was in good shape. It looked almost brand new! Also the book was great had a good story line, i will defiantly be reading it again.
B007SGM084|5.0|Very well written. Just enough detail to get the imagination going without giving too much. A must read for adults who like a bit of spice.
B009NQKXYK|2.0|not a big suprise and nothing that would keep it in your memory beyond a week. Good for a one time watch
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|What a wonderful gift has Whitney Houston given to the world letting us hear her brilliant voice since her debut in 1985! She still sends shivers down my spine when I listen to some of her songs! This is a wonderful Best of Album that let´s us listen to the most wonderful songs that made her such a worldwide star. I especially love the I look to you version with R. Kelly, what a wonderful song! Thanks also to Clive Davis for the never before released song \\"Never give up\\". This is a collection anyone should have in their music collection! RIP Whitney, we truly will miss you!
B003O86FMW|5.0|An amazing story that has captivated me from the start! Can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|The special effects make up for the defects in the story. The beginning scene has nothing to do with the story, but the the visual effect is remarkable, as are all the other effects of the movie.
B0094U0RJQ|5.0|bob dylan did it again, with his now raspy voice and slower tunes. He's great at what he does and he will forever keep putting out good music till the day he dies.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have only played the game once but I couldn't<br /> stop it is awesome it was not for the kindle fire it was for the xbox and it was awesome it was at my cousins house. he only let me play tor 10 min. but i couldn't stop. so that's why I give it 5 stars and I cant wait to buy it I don't care how much its worth its awesome and that is why I want to buy it! if it was up to me I would give it 500000000000000.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Although this is the same with the Fifty Shades of Grey books where you kinda read the same thing over and over and you get pissed off alot, I really enjoyed it! I could not put it down at all!
B005HSL626|4.0|Wow! Its awesome! You get to do awesome stuff. GET THIS!!!!!<br /><br />  I need more words for this so I have to do this.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|The book keeps repeating itself, I guess I was expecting something else. I felt forced to read it just to complete the trilogy...
B009IA9OLE|5.0|This game was totally addicting for my whole family. I had to hide in order to play my Kindle Fire all by myself with DH and DD #1 & 2 hanging over my shoulder offering \\"helpful\\" advice.  :)<br /><br />You work your way through 3 levels of increasing difficulty trying multiple cases per level. With money you earn winning cases, you can purchase furniture for your apartment/condo/mansion or buy clothing and car equipment. These purchases add to your Vanity, Decadence, and Materialism scores and over time, with strategic purchasing, you gain additional skills to defeat the prosecuting attorney. The game is never the same twice, allowing for multiple replays. In Options, you can also set the difficulty level to easy, normal, and difficult. For most adults, normal is a perfectly fine place to start.<br /><br />For those of you who remember the 80s well (especially if you were in high school or college then), the opening sequence is spot on and quite funny, at least for one or two viewings. Don't worry,; it is easy to skip too. Each defendant comes with a one sentence (usually) amusing back story describing their crime. There is banter back and forth between your character and the prosecuting attorney which can be pretty funny, at least through the first several cases. I'd recommend reading it the first time you play through the game as it establishes and develops the overall story, which will be important at the end of the game. However, if you find that you aren't mildly amused by the banter, it is also easily skipped by tapping on the screen.<br /><br />The first couple of cases are boringly easy to solve. Keep playing! They get tougher pretty quickly and you really have to think and strategize how you will use your \\"action points\\" each turn to overcome the challenges of evidence and witness of varying strengths.<br /><br />This game was well worth the couple of dollars I spent. The only downside (after playing the game through multiple configurations) is... what do Iplay now?! I can only hope that the developer is releasing a game just as good soon!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I love an author who is imaginative, witty, adept, and who can create a world that pulls me in completely.<br />David Mitchell does that with \\"Cloud Atlas.\\"<br /><br />Six stories comprise this novel, five of them told in two parts. We go forward in time from the mid-19th century into a post-apocalyptic future and then we travel back. Lives are intertwined and are carried across time, along with themes having to do with music, writing, friendship, and the incredible good and evil to which humanity can rise and fall.<br /><br />I couldn't put this book down, but made myself do it so I could savor each chapter, and know there was still more waiting for me when I returned. When it was finished, I sighed, and then read it again.
0062082353|5.0|If you enjoy reading about the military or history, do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of this book. It is an entertaining and quick read.
141659521X|5.0|I am giving this five stars because this book quite simply does the job. I was stressed out, looking for some great escapism for a day and knew this had done the job before.  It delivered again as for a day I remained wholly absorbed in the CIA world of Mitch Rapp.  For total escapism, this is A++++.  If you are looking for great literature, instead, it will not be a five star experience for you.<br /><br />The plot is timely.  The key CIA person on the ground in Afghanistan is abducted.  This person knows all the names of all the key CIA assets all over the world.  The damage he can do under interrogation is catastrophic. Mitch hits the ground running over there and immediately someone tries to assassinate him.  He sustains a head injury while fighting back and ends up in the hospital where it is discovered that he now has some memory problems.  And that is just the start of the story!<br /><br />I read this on my ipad in epub format, which is now my preferred format as I can adjust it perfectly so as to not need reading glasses.<br /><br />Perfect experience for me and all in all a very satisfying yarn.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B000F4MLZ8|5.0|We are fans of Iron and Wine and like that station on Pandora. That, and the Weather Channel were were we first came across Joshua Radin. We had only heard one of his songs and immediately knew that we wanted to hear more. So, we ordered all three of his CDs and are thoroughly enjoying all of them! IF you are a fan of this type of music, as we are, you will love listening to all three of Radin's CDs over and over again.

B001O22ELQ|3.0|Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is a short film that portrays the story of a young villain, Dr. Horrible, who is aspiring to be a part of the Evil League of Evil. The story uses song and dialogue to illustrate Dr. Horrible's adventures in the life of a villain. For someone like me who has never heard of Joss Whedon, the film seemed quite strange, but yet still enjoyable. Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is a 45 minute work of art with twists and turns that will keep audiences of all ages entertained.<br />Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog begins with Dr. Horrible's road to success as an evil mastermind. The two blocking figures that stand in his way are his arch nemesis, Captain Hammer, and the love of his life, Penny. He wants nothing more than to defeat Captain Hammer and take his rightful place in the Evil League of Evil, but Penny stands for everything opposite his dreams. She is the perfect model of the classic \\"good girl.\\" She wants nothing more than to save the world that Dr. Horrible wants to rule. Unfortunately for Dr. Horrible, Penny chooses to break his heart and be with his arch nemesis, Captain Hammer.<br />Dr. Horrible's plan to rule the world and earn his acceptance to the Evil League of Evil headed into a direction that he never expected. For the first time, his weapon of choice, a freeze ray, actually worked. His wishes to use it to end Captain Hammer, however, did not work out the way that he had planned. Dr. Horrible ended up hurting the only one he loved instead of the only one he hated.<br />In this film, the classic rivalry between good and evil is constantly in play. Dr. Horrible is considered the evil villain whose nemesis, Captain Hammer, is the typical example of the super hero. The conflict between good and evil can be overdone and cliché, but when done right, is still enjoyable for any viewer. Dr. Horrible is your average \\"bad guy\\" who doesn't see the error of his ways until the very end of the movie. Dr. Horrible wants to be the good guy forPenny and also, an evil genius, but realizes all too soon that he can't be both. He decides that he wants to pursue his career instead of his love life, which proves to be an enormous mistake.<br />Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is cleverly written and beautifully represented by the cast. Neil Patrick Harris does an excellent job with his character, Dr. Horrible. His acting and singing were thoroughly entertaining. Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is an Emmy Award-winning, cultural masterpiece. The twists and turns in the plot are enough to entice audiences of all ages. I highly recommend this movie to any audience looking for an interesting and humorous story.
0316228532|1.0|I also purchased this book for my RWC women book club.  Terrible language... too many difficult names to remember.  Only read 1/3 of this book, not sure even if my 15 years old nephew would like to read it... He read all the Harry Potter books and saw all the movies.. Such a bad language..Did not like it at all
B0089BSOPA|3.0|Of all the Halloween films, this is by far the most uninspired, but not always the most unwatchable.  There are parts to this film that I really do enjoy, and yet it doesn't really stick out to me as anything other than a clone of other more inspired work.  To go back to the time that this film was made, you have to realize that I think it was the first iconic horror sequel (Maybe not historically, but of the big slasher villains that are still popular and being remade today.)  John Carpenter had no intention of doing this film, as he felt like he had done everything that he cared to do with the first volume, but he sure didn't mind the royalties, so the film was developed at Universal, where Carpenter would spend a large part of his career in the 80's.  The idea of pre-steady cam pov shots that were popular in the first film were maintained with a new sense of gore that had emerged in the genre since the release of the first film.  This lead to the original pick for director (IT's Tommy Lee Wallace) leaving the film.  Rick Rosenthal, who had the same agent as Carpenter, was brought in.  What you end up with is a original script and concept by Carpenter that is now being handed over to a large studio, you still have Akad, an Arab film producer who had released the original that still had rights to the franchise, Rosenthal who would try and put his own stamp on it.  While the story line picks up exactly where the first film left off, and it does film in the gap of how we see the story from, but it really greatly deviates from the original and I can't help but wonder if the sequels hurt the legacy of the original.  The lighting and camera work in this film remind me a lot of the first film, as their aren't any immediate stylistic deviations in the film, and you never lose the sense that it occurs in middle America, as Loomis is driving around trying to find Michael after he isn't there after being shot seven times by a six shooter.  Lauri is taken to the local hospital, and there seems to be too films that are taking place.<br /><br />Loomis, who is looking for clues that takes him to the school where he finds that Lauri Strode is Michael's sister, as well as the Samhain reference on the wall, in what appears to be blood, though it has to be asked whose blood it is as no one has been murdered at the school that I can tell.  We also have the fake Michael being killed, which really doesn't serve any part of the story that I can tell other than to mock adults/law enforcement because we know better than them, but this dynamic doesn't really work for me as Loomis is a very well accepted hero, though the effect of the car crash immediately going into flames is iconic.  At the very heart of this film, there is a lot of images that work, and B movie coolness that is inserted without context or consideration for tone, that are added with the hollywood problem of throwing money at creative issues.  The Samhain reference of course would lead to the Halloween 5 and 6 story lines, though the druid occults have yet to come into play so we hear the iconic line from Loomis that we really haven't evolved much in 2000 years, meaning that as a species we still kill things and there is still evil in the world.<br /><br />This can be seen in the scene with the child who has the razor in his mouth at the hospital.  The new older cast seems to be less interested in pretense of innocence resulting in one of my favorite minor characters in the Halloween franchise with Budd, who sings foul songs and seems to only care about sex, not in the childish sense that he is new to girls, but that he still has rules of girls he won't go after, as this is more welcome to the grown up world where sex is a common occurrence.  The kills attempt to begin taking center stage as Michael eventually shows up, after a laughable jump out of the shadows first kill.  Once we get to the hospital we really begin to see where all the cooks in the kitchen got their say.  Rosenthal's first version of the film that has never been released, as Carpenter, after seeing the first cut of the film, felt that it would ruin the legacy of his first film, and reshot some key scenes to be more scary/gory.  Rosenthal would protest and eventually go on to direct the series ending Halloween Resurection (I still have memories of being the only guy in the theater for that one).  Akad didn't like the razor scene so I wonder just what else was cut.  I also have to say that the lighting in the hospital is still dark like the other parts of the film, so much so that even the film makers comment on it in the commentary.  It is a film that felt a need to change from the original in more elaborate kills that would include an eye puncture and graphic nudity in the hot tub scene, and want to change the scenery without changing it at all.  This is the film that Jamie Lee Curtis doesn't do interviews about.  The movie where a character slips and falls to his death, or at least seemingly so.  The whole film just seems uneven, and with two directors and lots of influence, especially from Friday the 13th, it is just hard to see this as a stand alone effort that tries to make you forget this isn't a John Carpenter film, while the idea that they needed to include gore almost apologizes for the superior first film<br /><br />The ending of the film, where Michael \\"dies\\" is a great stunt that includes the image of him crying blood from the eye holes of his mask in front of the sister he is trying to kill after she shoots him in the eyes (good shot), punctuated by an incredible fire stunt.  Though these seemed to mortalize Michael or at least take away from the he can't be killed vibe of the first.  It goes into that formulaic concept of killing the horror icon at the end of each installment that would plague later installments of most franchises.  Nothing has topped the simplicity of having the killer go through something that should have killed him and him still be out there trying to kill you that the first film left you with, and after seeing the first film, you assume that Michael is going to keep coming until Laurie is dead, which she does eventually die in Halloween 8, but I'm pretty sure our imaginations did a much better job of filling in the details.<br /><br />Also, I wanted to comment about the different versions of this film that are available.  I have two different versions of this film, the original universal release that was packaged with Halloween III, though the extras are consistent with with the single film release with the black and white Michael face on the cover.  I also bought the Collector's edition that includes a TV version of the film that is supposed to me more closely edited with the original Rosenthal material that does not seem to be very different than the theatrical version, though there are a couple of different cuts made to the film, but nothing to change the tone or composition and still includes the imposed Carpenter cuts, so either the Rosenthal version is not as different as we have been lead to believe or it is just never going to see the light of day.  There are a few new special features that I enjoyed on this edition.  I have not seen the 30th anniversary edition to know if the special features are different, but do see a slight difference in contrast in picture in the special edition that I prefer, though no remastering was labeled.  I also want to point out that I have not seen any Blu Ray versions of the film, but find that films made prior to the 90s do not seem to upgrade well past DVD and it seems a waste of money at least in past older releases I have purchased.'s first version of the film that has never been released, as Carpenter, after seeing the first cut of the film, felt that it would ruin the legacy of his first film, and reshot some key scenes to be more scary/gory.

I also want to point out that I have not seen any Blu Ray versions of the film, but find that films made prior to the 90s do not seem to upgrade well past DVD and it seems a waste of money at least in past older releases I have purchased.
0525952926|4.0|The second in Ken Follett's Century Trilogy is compelling and interesting,  He's an excellent researcher and a good writer.  This book is up to the standards of \\"Fall of Giants,\\" the first in the series.  I recommend it if you like historical fiction.
B003O7I6L6|5.0|Ok, so this is my favorite film.  I love and know almost everything there is to know about this film and the way that it was made, and have since bought every version I have seen come available for the film, from VHS, original DVD release, special edition, and now Blu Ray, and I have to say that there are no special features on this version that were on the Special Edition.  The DVD version that comes with this set is from the original release that had a wide screen and standard version duel sided disc with only a trailer.  With that being said, I really did enjoy the transfer of the film and for just the film I would definitely recommend this version of the film, but if you are a fan of the film, I would also recommend finding a DVD copy of the Special edition.
B0000029GA|5.0|If you could define real hip-hop music this album is the truest form of it! Nas kills it with great story telling and maybe the smoothest flows ever laid on tracks. Must have
0099529122|5.0|The book was received in as great condition as I could expect for having been years past its publication. It has yellowed a bit and has very minor wear but otherwise is in awesome condition. If anyone is wondering if this is worth reading, I can't put it down. I can't believe I made it through high school without reading this, but I can only be sure my enjoyment is amplified by not doing homework on it ;)
B008BDZOZY|3.0|Not as good as I expected and the cover? What is with the face? Am I missing something? Really am a Byrne and St. Vincent fan-this one just didn't do it for me.
B008JIFJ4W|5.0|Great song, this group has lots of potential, got to see them live shortly after I ordered and downloaded the song. Was a great time, lots of energy.
B009AZZEU2|4.0|I'll get to the point.  If you liked/love Down on the Upside and Superunknown, you will most likely like/love this album. Any of King Animal's songs could have been plucked from or inserted into those last two albums.  Let me make it perfectly clear though that this is not a  case of \\"more of the same.\\"  The similarities of songs to those of the past are more due to Adam Kasper's production and Kim Thayil's Guild S-100 than anything else.  In fact, there are some elements of experimentation, such as one of my favorite songs, \\"Rowing\\" with its layered vocal harmonies blended with the occasional power chord (I kept hearing the Temptations \\"Ball of Confusion\\" in my head as I listened).  Great album.<br /><br />EDIT 3/27/13: I took the album down a star.  It's a great album, but after listening to past Soundgarden albums again, I realized that they are just better.  I hear elements of what I liked in past albums though.
1451695195|5.0|The books I ordered arrived as promised as soon as they were released! I found this doctor's story facinating and encouraging. I've read many near-death stories but this one was compelling since this doctor did NOT believe in these types of tales he had heard from his many patients (he knew it must be the brain playing tricks on the subject's mind). That is, until he himself was without a functioning brain for a week! Excellent!
B0063IH60K|4.0|app works really good no delay in time. I like the option to deal winning deal<br />I would recommend it
B003TSEL7S|4.0|Love the style of writing and themes underneath the surface... predictable plot with a little bit of mystery.  Just wish there was less dialogue and more depth.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Wow.  WOW!  I've been a fan of Macklemore since I first heard and saw him perform here in Eugene.  I didn't know who he was when I met him at his merch table (he opened for Blue Scholars) but if I could go back to that night I'd at least give him a handshake and preferably a hug.  His words, combined with the spectacular musical abilities of Ryan Lewis, are genius, and I don't use that word lightly.  This might be one of those Joshua Tree albums of hip-hop.<br /><br />WATCH THE VIDEO FOR \\"SAME LOVE\\"!  I cry every time I see it or hear the song and I know for a fact I'm not alone.  The end of the video will really get you.  The video for \\"Wing$\\" re-defines music videos as an art form and is so good you'd think Scorsese made it.  The message of anti-materialism is especially important when you consider that a large part of Macklemore's demographic is teenagers.<br /><br />One of the amazing things about Macklemore and Ryan Lewis is how they can be so humorous and lighthearted in one song and so inspirational and deep in the next.  The song \\"Thrift Shop\\" on this album is humorous and quite enjoyable (the video especially), but \\"Same Love\\" and \\"Ten Thousand Hours\\" and \\"Neon Cathedral\\" are so intensely inspirational and from the heart that they make you want to just hug the album.  The latter, \\"Neon Cathedral,\\" and also \\"Starting Over,\\" really hit those of us who have dealt with addictions, and it's songs like that which give us inspiration and a drive to become better people; they connect us with the artists in a way that is rare, especially if one has listened only to radio hip-hop.<br /><br />The first song, \\"Ten Thousand Hours,\\" is largely about the almost spiritual satisfaction that comes from putting in the effort to learn something to the utmost and ignore the common desire to just settle for something easy.  I'm a very ambitious, self-motivated person myself so I'm no stranger to that but the hook \\"Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands / ten thousand hands, to carry me\\" really put it in a different perspective: every hour I've spent learning my craft isn't a struggle, it's a small, subtle push in the right direction.  It's this way of looking at things and providing a beautifully loving perspective that makes Macklemore so unique.  I'm a huge fan of Atmosphere (of course), especially their last three albums, but one of the things I like more about Macklemore and Ryan Lewis is that they mix humor and fun into their often heavy and serious songs.<br /><br />PLEASE buy the album, don't download it.  I am PROUD to support Macklemore and Ryan Lewis and every dollar they earn from their art, real art, is well-deserved and worth it.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|My son loves Minecraft and he loved this toy. I felt like it was an extremely small set for the price, but that feeling was offset by how much my son enjoyed it.
B008NW67E0|3.0|Really enjoy Mumford and Sons' sound, but found this new release lacking.  Definitely not as good as their first piece.  Songs sound far too much alike.  Could have used some more contrasting tunes.

B005J2UM9S|5.0|I loved this movie, the beginning was slow and then once around 20 min or so, it took off. a few jump scenes and this reminded me of how you felt thru out Blair Witch Project.
B000TGCR38|5.0|When you watch the movie Black Book, you can see why the Critics say it is the best Dutch movie ever made. It is based from a true story when Holland is under Nazi occupation when a young Jewish Girl played by Carice van Houten ( who also played Nina von Staffenburg in Valkyrie) is reunited with her parents and her Brother but only to see them and other Jewish people get murdered by German Soldiers. She manged to survive and she was determined to find the Dutch \\" Double - crosser\\" who took money from Jewish people who offered them a safe passage to Belgium and taking their money and taking them directly to the path of the Nazis. She decides to join the Dutch Resistance and is prepared to do what ever it takes to get the information she needs to find out those details and also getting as much information from the German High command in Amsterdam. She gains the trust of the Germans and gets access to the Dossiers and falls in love with a German Major. She also discovers that there are traitors in the Dutch Resistance as well. Black Book is a very well made movie and it keeps your attention the whole time while you are watching it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I think I set a record on how fast I finished this book, it is a serious page turner.<br />And it takes some good twists and turns. I can see this one becoming a movie, and Denzel playing lead role :)
1423140605|5.0|I have a 12 year old daughter and an 8 year old son, and both are voracious readers. They both have read and reread this book about 3 times each so far, so I would say that it's an engaging story for fans of Rick Riordan's demigod series.

0307596885|5.0|Fans of Alice Munro will be very happy with her new collection of short stories. Those that are new to her writing would be better served by starting out with one of her earlier books as these stories are not all that typical of her writing and there is an autobiographical section in the back of the book.<br /><br />Ms. Munro has published twelve collections of short stories and one novel. She is a winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award, the Booker Award and the Lannan Literary Award. Her books have been translated into thirteen languages.<br /><br />In the autobiographical section, there are tender remembrances of her past and her time with her familiy. 'Dear Life', the title story, is about her growing up. Her father started a business raising foxes and minks for their pelts. Eventually the business failed and her father went to work in a forgery. Her mother developed Parkinson's Disease when she was in her forties. The family did not realize that it was progressive and incurable. In 'The Eye', she writes about Sadie who helps out in their house. Alice and she develop a close bond. Sadie gets run over by a car on the way back from a dance when she is not yet twenty years old. This story explores the quality of their relationship.<br /><br />One of the more powerful stories in the collection is 'Amundsen'. A teacher in a rural sanitarium for children with tuberculosis becomes engaged to a doctor who works there. Things don't progress as she hoped they would. 'Leaving Maverly' was my favorite story. Each night, a police officer drives a young woman of a very fundamentalist religious denomination home. One night she skips town. His own wife is very ill with serious heart disease and he ends up taking her to Toronto for care. The story is about hope turning to loss with no way of finding your way back. 'In Sight of The Lake' is about a woman looking for a doctor because of her memory loss. She finds that the world is a different place than she thought it was.<br /><br />Late in the book, Ms. Munro states that \\"We say of some things that they can't be forgiven, or that we will never forgive ourselves. But we do - we do it all the time\\". This is a recurrent theme in her stories. We do things we hate, we end up hating ourselves but there is forgiveness eventually.<br /><br />Most of the stories take place in rural areas of Canada and many of the them occur in earlier times. Few are contemporary. This is likely because Ms. Munro herself grew up in an earlier age than now.<br /><br />She is the grande dame of short story writing and there is no one who can write a story as she can. We read, we get pulled in, and then we end up wondering, even at the end, what will happen next..<br /><br />Late in the book, Ms. Munro states that \\"We say of some things that they can't be forgiven, or that we will never forgive ourselves.

B0088RQ4X4|5.0|Very good movie to watch. Enjoyed it very much. Lots of action and creative scenes that made it entertaining. I would definately reccomend
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am probably the last person to finally read this - am glad I did. Liked it better than original.
B008M34INW|5.0|This movie was good especially since I am not a fan of Mel Gibson. I would reccomend to anyone who enjoys action movies.
B006Z7Z3S6|5.0|The Innkeepers is a terrific slow burning horror film about a haunted hotel and it's irresistible two person staff. It possesses exactly what I look for in a good scary movie.
B009GEAPYW|1.0|I rented this movie on accident thinking it was the new Batman. This is a CARTOON if anyone else gets mislead as well. Very disappointed.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|As always, Grisham is a wonderful read, with a great story line full of twists and surprises.  A real page-turner.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|It is okay. not great just ok. when I want to mindlessly push a button I play this. la la. la
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|Enjoyed this novel.  Main character was in the advertising industry and a lot of the action took in France.  I remembered places I had been.  Had trouble putting it down.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|my husband and i really enjoyed this. great casting, great writing; it was just fun. the cinematography was impressive too.
B00555X8OA|5.0|I would highly recommend this book for everyone, and especially for people working in administration, management, finances, etc. It gave me a lot to think about:  showed me how misleading a sense of certainty could be; how common are cognitive errors; in how many way we like to fool ourselves, etc.<br /><br />Whats more is written in a really accesible style.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Awesome game, my daughter first got this for her device and after playing a few times I was hooked and now have it on my device as well.  Not your usual mindless game, you actually have to put some thought into this game.
B0077QS9C6|5.0|This movie provides in real black and white footage the story about Sennas rise and his childhood dreams all the way up to his death behind the wheel. Many interviews are from the real people in his life. This is interesting if you are a race fan.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Does exactly what it says. If you don't want to dish out for new buds this is a perfect solution.
B008B3GP2A|2.0|Let me start off by saying I love Maroon 5. I have all their albums and I really like the band, but I am really disappointed with their new album and here's why.<br />I am so sick of the latest hip hop music which really has no variety at all and all the beats seem to programmed on a computer, and there is nothing to show for real talent. Sad to say, Maroon 5 seemed to have figured out that these kind of albums are what make them money and what the teenagers want nowadays and have adopted this strategy. When I bought the album I found my self skipping the tracks even before I heard it for the first time, this is how monotonous this album is. It is just one more album that's out there now that has no substance and only sounds good because of the deep bass and the rear view mirror of your car shaking, if you are into that kind of a thing. My advice don't waste your money on this album you will be thoroughly disappointed. I still have faith in Maroon 5 and hope they get back to their roots in the next album.
1480260517|5.0|What a wonderful book! I have watched the movie, \\"The Secret (Law of Attraction)\\", Read books such as: \\"Evolve Your Brain - Joe Dispenza\\", \\"Think and Grow Rich - Napoleon Hill\\", and \\"The Success Principles; How To Get From Where You Are To Where You Want To Be - Jack Canfield.\\" These books and this book I am reviewing, and the movie I mentioned above teach you things like; visualization, meditation, prayer, affirmations, desire, faith, and auto-suggestion and other elements. This book, \\"The Power of Your Subconscious Mind\\" - Brings the universal principles and science behind understanding these elements and why that are important...they reach your subconscious mind! In my personal opinion, after reading this book, I have a deep understanding that your subconscious mind is the most powerful \\"Infinite Intelligence\\" in the Universe. It is a higher-power we can utilize!<br /><br />(The following statements are in this book but in my own words:) We need to Influence our subconscious minds with positive auto-suggestions, to choose life, choose love, to choose health. We need to believe in good fortune, divine guidance, right action, and all the blessings of life. We need to feed our subconscious with thoughts of harmony, peace, and gratitude. We need to accept that faith is the process of healing, we need to visualize ideas and outcomes with complete faith and confidence, and accept that any picture held in the mind will be brought to pass, to the physical dimension of the outer-world. We need to acknowledge that the power that made the body, heals the body... That the infinite intelligence, our subconscious, makes all our bodily organs, keeps our heart beating, any other automatic functions, we can heal ourselves. Always feed your mind consciously with positive thoughts, and affirmations and prayers, which will gradually reach your subconscious. This book is filled with beautiful prayers and affirmations to help you fight fears, develop a money consciousness, develop meaningful relationships, to forgive people, and much more. I now have a very extraordinarily understanding of the elements of visualization, meditation, prayer, affirmations, desire, faith, and auto-suggestion, and I hope people pick-up and read this book, then read it again, and again, study it and digest it, and let what you have learned and cultivated speak through the type of character you are as a human being.<br /><br />I would like to leave you with this prayer from the book on choosing happiness, this prayer should be done when you open your eyes in the morning: \\"Divine order takes charge of my life today and every day. All things work together for good for me today. This is a new and wonderful day for me. There will never be another day like this one. I am divinely guided all day long, and whatever I do will prosper. Divine loves surrounds me, enfolds me, and enwraps me, and I go forth in peace. Whenever my attention wanders away from that which is good and constructive, I will immediately bring it back to the contemplation of that which is lovely and of good report. I am a spiritual and mental magnet attracting to myself all things, which bless and prosper me. I am going to be a wonderful success in all my undertakings today. I am definitely going to be happy all day long.\\"
B009E2WX3W|4.0|Great CD.  Get this one if you like Peter Gabriel's classics. It was worth the price to have this one transferrable to MP3, instead of cassette.  Better sound quality.
B008KL2ITW|5.0|I think am in love with travi. I love this book an am so sad that it ended I read it in a day then re-read it the day after. Can't wait for walking disaster, I was hoping it would this book would be a trilogy but it not, but am still exited to read Travis's side of the story.
0385344228|3.0|The book grabs from the first page, and the premise is interesting, but as one critic pointed out it is, at times, dragging a little too much.  I found myself being able to skip whole paragraphs... there are great twists and I did read it in a few nights, wanting to get to the end... it is definitely not predictable...
B000HAB4KS|3.0|This could have been an allegory if not for all the shootemup. But do go see Cloud Atlas and V for Vendetta.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This was a wonderful book. It was a really easy read and tackled a touch subject with humor and a plot that will appeal to both adults and young adults. I recommend this book to everyone. Just expect to cry at some point :)
B009Y2KGSQ|1.0|Aerosmith rolls out of bed for a snore-fest, just as they do every ten years or so.  Only this time, they forgot to change their man-diapers.  I'm a devoted fan from Boston, and remember when they walked on water at WBCN, in the Fens, at the Rat and Paradise, etc.  So, I go way back.  I want to like their new stuff.  I long to like their stuff.  It's \\"me\\".<br /><br />I felt as flat as warm beer in a lip-stick rimmed Solo cup from last night's Allston rave when I played this lousy CD.<br /><br />The songs on this CD are as lifeless as a blow-up doll after a Boston College frat party.  They reek like the hairless armpits of a neurotic Harvard undergrad during finals week.<br /><br />Honestly, if you just listen to the samples on Amazon and iTunes, you get a sense of how spiritless these tunes really are. Smells like teen spirit?  Try: smells like Rico Petrocelli's bedside commode.<br /><br />No sense wasting your dollars on what will be -- along with \\"Just Push Play\\", \\"Nine Lives\\", \\"Night In The Ruts\\", to name a few of their Pepe LePew albums -- nothing more than recycled insulation blown into the walls of your crazy Auntie Jean's Hampton Beach rental bungalow.<br /><br />It's a shame, because the brilliance of this band --\\"Pump\\", \\"Rocks\\", \\"Toys\\", hell, even the sloppy \\"Draw The Line\\" -- is truly awesome, memorable and \\"crankable\\".  An aural eargasm.  Those are \\"stand and beat your chest like a great baboon\\" CDs.  Even the snot-nosed, AM radio friendly molasses that is \\"Get A Grip\\" is better than \\"Dimension\\".  And \\"Get a Grip\\" stinks!<br /><br />The \\"Dimension\\" CD is like a whoopie cushion with a hole in it.  Full of promise for a good time, laughs and fun, but ultimately a deflated mess.

B001CDZZI6|5.0|No need to buy the hard copy book when the most important thing a manager needs is for his people to take the strengthfinders 2.0 test online. When you buy the Kindle version, you're immediately sent he key code for them to take it right away. The employees I gave this to completely agreed with the results of the test. I've found it much easier to work with employee strengths than correct weaknesses.
B0028IDXDS|4.0|I bought this for my three month old son. The passy was too small for his liking but I knew that might be an issue when I bought it. But it was too cute not to give it a try. Since my son wouldn't take the passy I cut it out and sewed his on instead. Realistically I could've just bought a small stuffed animal and sewed his in cheaper but you live and learn. This is for younger babies. Wish the company made these for different ages. But me sewing his in works just fine.
B009VB97EY|2.0|I thought the story line was boring and the movie too predictable.  It did have some entertaining moments.  I thought the woman who played the lead female role was the best thing about the movie.

B008AT71WI|5.0|My history with LSoH goes back to it's original off Broadway cast album.  The inventiveness and pure unadulterated FUN screamed out of the speakers.  And then the show came to L.A. in a small theatre perfect for its itimacy and hands on feel for the play.  Michael Jackson was in the audience that night, and yet all eyes were on the stage.  Ellen Green was, and is, miraculous in her exptertise and acting chops, not to mention her incredible voice.  Would someone please write something special for her?????<br /><br />In 1985 I was visiting a friend in London, and one night went to the Baker Street Cinema's midnight screening of the complete version of BRAZIL (already cut to shreds in the US, despite the critics award!) and who should be sitting in the audience but Rick Moranis...taking a midnight break from his shooting schedule....at any rate, while I was in London I found the original French language cast of the show which held its own Gallic wit and irony firmly in tact.<br /><br />The film finally opened, the critics roared, and many of us wondered....WHAT HAPPENED TO THE REAL ENDING????  A friend of mine had been working on the editing of the film and told me all about the attack on NY and the eating of the cast, but not a trace remained.  There had been little bits and pieces released in dark alleys of the internet, but now, in FULL COLOR AND STEREOPHONIC SOUND comes the attack of Audrey IIs all over the world.  And what a brilliant piece of work it is.  And though we wish Audrey and Seymour could return to somewhere that's green, they will have to settle with BEING something that's green.  The film is just as delightful as it should have been and somewhere in the back of my mind I keep thanking Roger Corman for beiong the brilliant film maker and mentor for the film community.  So now we have the film, as envisioned by Miss Piggy, and long may it play.  Now.....FEED ME!!!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best Bible app available on the amazon store hands down. Not only is it great to read but super easy for everyone as it has specific Bible plans for casual Christians to stricter Christians and everyone in between. it has every version you can think of and even has audio readings for those who need it. Descriptions of scriptures and activities in each plan to increase understanding. there is so much more, download it and experience it for yourself and I guarantee you wont regret it.

B00004TS0E|5.0|Better than the original!  So unususual for a retooling in Hollywood.  Mara Wilson is absolutely convincing and unaffected as the precocious little cynic.  And everyone else in the cast is pitch perfect!  I watch it EVERY year!

If you are a person who enjoys combat reading this is a must read. Hope this helped..

B008RTE08E|5.0|This is undoubtedly one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  THe Beatles have done what no other band of their era could do, at least as good as they have - go off on some weird experimental thing, like the Monkees' \\"Head\\", for example.  Head was cute, but nothing compared to MMT.  It's true, I do wish I was on that bus, and I wish I was one of the lucky viewers on December 26, 1967, at 8:30 pm British time.  After the Petula Clark show, the Beatles were going to be in a new special, and after getting everything I wanted for Christmas and with some time off from work for the holidays, what better way to digest all those Christmas leftovers than to watch the new Beatles tv special.  For years, I'd take out my old VHS copy and watch it on December 26 to recreate the fun that at least some of the viewers had - the viewers who didn't make it into the papers the next day.<br /><br />This can be seen as a sort of drug-induced sequel, or even a parody, of A Hard Day's Night, wherein you have a cantankerous relative in the care of one of the band members - Jessie Robins steals her scenes just as Wilfred Brambell had in \\"HDN\\" - also, the songs just happen to pop up with no real build up from the previous scene, no dialogue led you into them, but they're such great songs no one even cares.<br /><br />People try to see this as a long-form video, but it's more than that.  It truly is the story of a bunch of charabanc bus passengers seeing and experiencing some pretty weird stuff as they head for the Blackpool Lights - all guided by 4 magicians.<br /><br />So, where's the bus?  It's 10 miles north on Dewsbury Road - and you'll have a lovely time.

B00992CF6W|1.0|This game is the best game out there! But not on pocket edition! Horrible on the iPod or an android device! Love this game on PC and Xbox, but not on android or iPod. It changes the look of Minecraft and makes it look like a texture pack! They just added creepers in the game! Can you believe it! And cannot play online only in local! Worst iPod or android game out there! I love Minecraft and I am a big fan, but not on pocket edition!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Overall it was a fairly good book. When I first started reading it I put it down after nine chapters and thought \\"what was I thinking getting into this book?\\" After a week or so off I decided to give the book another chance and I'm glad I did. I hate to leave books left unfinished and it was well worth it. Granted the subject matter is not for all readers but if one goes into it with an open mind it is worth the time to spare.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The \\"Hunger Games\\" series is a great read for young adults, especially young women. Living in a time where the majority of teen fiction is centered on a romance, I think that the \\"Hunger Games\\" really stands out as a series that takes young female readers seriously. Female readers enjoy reading about adventures, fighting, and hardship just as much as they enjoy romances. The fact that the market for teen books is mostly comprised of teen romance or, even worse, teen paranormal romance, is disturbing. \\"The Hunger Games\\" is a great read for all ages; my mother enjoys reading it just as much as I do. The fact that the main character is a strong female is almost as impressive as the point that all of her male relationships are platonic (well, to her anyway. Spoiler alert!)
B009VB7QQA|5.0|This movie was entertaining as movies should be. If you are looking for something more realistic by all means do not watch this but if you just want a good movie that will let you sit back and be entertained then watch this
B004DLPXAO|4.0|The app works great and I use it all the time.<br />I still have books that I did not buy that keeps being displayed on it and I cannot delete it. It also shows up on my Kindle for PC too but not on my Amazon online account. I have contacted Amazon many of times about this but they cannot help me.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book is a very credible account of a kind of near death experience. As told it almost seems more appropriate to call it a near life experience as he left a \\"rotting\\" body to soar spiritually into a realm most only hope for. It is a good read from a credible source with a welcome message that it will happen to you. A must read.
B005R32L66|5.0|The app works fine.<br />video and voice quality is fine too but that really reflects back to what kind of tablet you have.<br />The app actually works better than the Skype software that I use on my Windows computer.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Really fun and great set ups. Better than Angry Birds. I loved the pirate stages with the cannons. Would definitely buy more of these games.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I uninstalled this app after 1 week of use. It is Extremely slow at everything.<br />I now use Facebook Fast by Allegiance Gaming and it works perfect and very fast.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Great compact speedlight flash unit.  I use it on my Nikon D3000 SLR.  I would also recommend it as a back up flash.
B00A11AN6O|1.0|Why would I only want to upload/download photos to my Android Tablet and that's all?<br /><br />SugarSync gives me 5GB of storage and I can sync whatever I want from my computers to my tablet.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Imagine Dragons...<br />not just a cool name for a band, but these guys have fire-breathing talent!<br /><br />Them being called an Indie Rock band is pretty accurate in my humble opin.<br />They mix beat, melody and great vocals with flair & style.<br /><br />Night Visions is a great album and it took me surprise.  Every song here is good.<br />My favorites are \\"Radioactive\\" and \\"Amsterdam\\"; however, I could call all of them a fave.<br />These guys are beasts...  dragons of music!<br /><br />If you want a refreshing sound for the home, car, or a morning run with ur earphones on, buy this album ASAP.<br /><br />A definite 5*
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Very simple to use without any problems.<br />I'm running it on 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich Visual Land Prestige 10.<br />I can quickly clean out the Cache and Privacy files.<br />Auto kill would have been a nice feature to have but it doesn't have it.
B0098JJYZQ|5.0|Really enjoyed both books, with much better storyline than 50 shades. None of the hardcore sex, but a truly heartwarming story.
B00005M91K|5.0|This movie is a must see by everyone. It will touch everyone. It's a documentary of the world we live in set to an amazing soundtrack, without any narrating.  It shows the beauty along with the things we don't want to see. It's a masterpiece and I highly recommend it.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|A very good story, and complex characters makes this a must read.  Could not stop reading and had to purchase the sequel.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|its very useful for managing your battery life.  Especially when your reading or bin the middle of something. The breakdown is perfect of how much power is left in each category.
B0086700CM|5.0|It's a great game. I love playing it when I have free time to myself. My kids love it too.
B00846REIS|2.0|Perhaps reading the Fifty series skewed my point of view, but I was not impressed with the storyline or character development. It was fast and loose and not in a good way. Very much a cheap thrills book.
B00493E1GI|4.0|Just a good movie about someone lost who finds her way again. Not an easy journey but that's life, it isn't all happy and sunshine.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I have read all of Kate Morton's books and loved them all.  The Secret Keeper was the best one yet.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|I watched the entire season as fast as I could.  This is an amazing show.  I'm so glad that I started watching this show.  The plot is so good.  It keeps you interested in every single minute.  I highly recommend this show to anyone.  I usually don't like super action shows, but this show is so interesting that you have to keep watching episode after episode.  I'm sad that I am already on season 5 and it's the last season!  yikes.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|This is another great hidden item mystery by the developer. I played the demo and bought the full version. The cool part is instead of finding hidden objects you can choose to play mahjong  to uncover the objects, a little twist on this style of gaming.  I would definitely recommend  for those who like this type.
B00005MCX3|5.0|If you are a fan of Motorhead and the legend of Lemmy Kilmister, you would like this album. If you like music that takes you on an instrumental voyage to another dimension, this is an album for you as well. Basically, if you appreciate good music and the vibes that come from it, this is an album for you. I would recommend this to anyone!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|So many features and endless options..  I have it on my Kindle Fire and its been on vacation with me four times! Never have to mess with a standard alarm clock.Love love love it!!!!
B000G73Y6E|4.0|If you like your music sexy and danceable, than this is the album for you. One of the many great byproducts of Josh Homme and his many eclectic and talented friends. My favorite track being &#34;Eagle's Goth.&#34; This is a great album.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Taut, dramatic legal drama written by someone who knows the legal system well. Characters fully fleshed out and well drawn; one gets involved with them and the situation. Keeps you engrossed until the very end.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My oldest son downloaded it on his phone my youngest son wanted it for his kindle had to pay because it was HD but they both love playing the game.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|I am so excited to have new music from Soundgarden! This album did not disappoint, and I actually like every song. Buy it for the love of real rock n roll.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|Every once in a while a film comes along that just hits all the right notes. This one is a film in that category. Beautiful. Not much needs to be said except you need to see the stop motion on this one and the voices and story are absolutely stellar as well. When you take into account how hard these films are to produce then you get an idea just how much work went into this. Each character has a distinct personality and humor. The Fox family is totally spot on as far the characterization goes for this type of film.<br /><br />That people give this one star show, inextricably, the laughably sincere nature and awful taste of many Amazon reviewers. In one such review we find the critique that one cannot further 'suspend their disbelief' because of the increasingly crazy nature of a film.... about anthropomorphic foxes and rodents. Ummmm. Yeah. You can tell the other people in this one star category are as imbecilic and unappreciative of art in the same way. It is actually quite hilarious to read their reviews and makes for a good time although I now digress....<br /><br />This is grade triple A good. So many memorable locations and scenes. SO many memorable ways in which the art direction wows the audience. Easily of the better stop motion animations of out time. I find it very hard to rank Anderson's output more so than just about any director because each film, mostly, is fascinating and on par just in different ways. This is still one of his most accomplished works if nothing else. The bluray, while not being a super high bitrate, is a joy to watch unfold and you should do yourself a favor and rent or buy it as it is a keeper in every way.
0688172377|4.0|This book did well explaining to the reader what she endured from childhood to adulthood.  I felt her pain and anxiety throughout the book.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|Wow, some of the people on Amazon are just ridiculous. This is another great film from Anderson. He really hasn't had a misstep just different tones and ideas that some like more than the others. It's pretty hard to rank his films to be honest as they are all pretty damn good. This one has a great theme of childhood exploration and satisfies for me the remembrance of an innocent time long past. This one really singles in on some personal stuff if you get it but I would imagine a lot of people won't have a clue and maybe that is for the better. The directing is astute and creative as always and the acting from all involved fits the film perfectly. The romance between the two kids is sweet and subtle. People who are calling it awkward or lewd are friggin' amazingly daft. The whole point of the story revolves around childhood love and imagination. I give it the full five stars. Wes is clearly a very talented guy and I look forward to each film he puts out. Please stop expecting this guy to make some kind of melodramatic cringe-inducing drama because that is simply not the kind of stuff this guy does.
B0058YPL66|5.0|The progression of fairy tale character's that are used in this series holds your interest as you never know who is going to show up next. The twists and turns to the story line keep you looking forward to what is going to happen next. I ended up having a 4 hour &#34;Once&#34; marathon on a dreary Saturday and made myself save the rest for the next day. Enjoyable adult entertainment of some favorite childhood characters.
B009A9EQL6|4.0|from all ive read either people love the new album or hate I LOVE IT BEST since get a grip ive been a LONG TIME fan i heard this amazing gift of a band when i was prob 1 heard 1st from my dad he saw them at 1 of there 1st shows in a barn! so needless to say started with 1st album even as got older and still love em and after all this time since a new album WOW JUST GREAT! THANK YOU AEROSMITH AND THANK YOU DAD !
B00846REIS|5.0|If you liked Fifty Shades of Grey series you will love this book. This book takes you more into their lives, but still has just enough romance and sex to keep you reading. Good fast read.....enjoy
B008XG1X18|5.0|A good app. I use it everyday. Great for pinterest users on the go.  It easily connects to facebook. Thanks
B0007KTBIU|5.0|If you have Disney Addicts at home like I do, they'll eat this up. Even though Pocahontas aparently looked more like Maria Ouspenskaya with a dark wig and John Smith was a red-bearded ape prone to Baron Munchausen Syndrome (he likely confused Pochahontas with a babe on a polynesian island from an earlier voyage) it's fun fare. Suspend your disbelief, let history go its own way and enjoy.
B00008QSA5|4.0|Since this album was first released I have loved the instrumental Bloomfield/Kooper songs. I could skip most of the Stills stuff on this record as well as any of the songs with vocals. But the blues guitar and keyboard songs from this album are classic. I particularly like the new remixes they added without the horns. The horns always sounded overdubbed and canned to me in the original recordings.
B00361R2VU|2.0|Movie was Ok but the sound quality was alful.  Sadly as I have stated in my previous review of the forth kind, I do not have these problems with any other competing service I use.  Due to this I will start spending<br />My money elsewhere in this dept.
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|One of my favourite Anderson-directed films; eccentric, colourful, and clever. I heartily recommend it. A 10/10; would definitely watch again.
B001KZG99A|4.0|Movie was Ok but the sound quality was alful.  Sadly as I have stated in my previous review of the forth kind, I do not have these problems with any other competing service I use.  Due to this I will start spending<br />My money elsewhere in this dept.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is easy to use, portable and inexpensive, but still does a great job. I have a couple of knives that I sharpened with this and was able to get them razor sharp in very little time. Excellent product and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a good sharpener.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham's books always keep you on the edge of your seat.  I couldn't put this book (kindle) down.  It is a book that would make a great movie.  I highly recommend it.  A good 4 to 5 stars!
B009FBX5M0|1.0|This, for me, is a very disappointing soundtrack.  The title song is missing, and even though it can NOT compare to one by Shirley Bassey, it should have been included and there is absolutely no excuse for this.  There are only a few seconds to remind us of Monty Norman's James Bond Theme, and most of the remaining tracks consist of adrenaline pounding chase music.  A couple of the tracks are very nice (Grand Bazaar, Jellyfish), but once again we are reminded that John Barry is indeed gone.  It really takes a stretch of the imagination to label this is a James Bond soundtrack.  It's decent.  But it's not Bond.  Let's hope for something much better next time around.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|This a terrific album.  Don't know why others found it unappealing.  Give it a try; you'll try to dislike it, but I assure you it won't work.  This Diane at her best.
B0087ITC9C|4.0|Having seen the previews several times for this I was fairly certain what I was in for. Turns out the previews were misleading. I have to assume were they more truthful, fewer people would have forked over the dough to see it.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Denzel wakes up on the morning of his next flight. He's in bed with a flight attendant. They're drinking and doing cocaine. During said flight a malfunction threatens the plane. He's able to miraculously bring it down and only lose 6 \\"souls\\" in the process. During his recovery it's discovered that he has a lot of liquor and drugs in his system, so industry politics sets in to try and keep him from going from being a hero to a criminal. It's a rough road and he stumbles a lot.<br /><br />I thought this plot was going to be more mechanical. That it would tighten and tighten until the investigators found the crucial element that brought the plane down and exonerated Denzel. Nope. This is a drama about him coming to terms with his alcoholism. You see all the fits and starts. You hear all the lies he says to everyone, including himself, as he journeys down an uncertain path.<br /><br />Zemeckis has come a long way as a director. This is much more subtle an outing than we're used to seeing from him. The scene where the plane is going down, as harrowing and white knuckling as it is, is much less 'in your face' than it might have been had he done it a decade ago. It's quieter overall as well. Given the subject matter there could have been a lot more histrionics than there were. The scenes and performances are more subdued and introspective. It also sports a softer look. He goes for a more natural feel. His projects usually aim for visual excess.<br /><br />Michael Phillips, reviewer for the Chicago Tribune, loved this film. He gave it his highest rating. As much as I liked it, I didn't think it achieved quite the level he did. Not because it wasn't done well. I'm just not convinced that some of Washington's struggles withhis beast haven't already been done before in films such as \\"Clean and Sober\\" and \\"The Lost Weekend\\" to name just a few. So this is not breaking new ground at some levels. But it is done as well as it could be given the material. Phillips thought the ending was a bit pat but felt the film makers \\"earned\\" it. I liked the end. It's the cliff that Washington will either jump off or not.<br /><br />This is a heck of a flick. It's good at every level. If you're into dramas they don't get much better than this.
B000JQUHLM|5.0|I always felt good or glad after reading this book, just like the first Pollyanna.  I might even read these again sometime, which is unusual for me.
B007X4ECMI|3.0|Luc Besson, as either writer, producer or director, will always deliver up something that is worth watching for some reason. That's the case here but it's not one of his better efforts.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. It's 2079 and the President of the United States' daughter is on prison ship, above the earth, spearheading an investigation into the procedures being used  with the prisoners. The prisoners are in \\"stasis\\" but a screw-up happens and the they escape to take her hostage for their demands. The government now enlists the help of an operative, on whom they are trying to pin a treason rap, to save the day.<br /><br />This is \\"Escape From New York\\" in outer space. But it is fraught with problems. Most are at the script level. There have been a fair number of films made using this outline. And, aside from the setting, this does little to break the mold. The plot points are hack level at best. The writing is lazy. They use certain points verbatim from other films. Other items, seen often before, needed to be more clever and it seemed they were looking for the easiest way out. Guy Pearce, who I like a lot, is given a smartalec role with no relief. Essentially everything that comes out of his mouth is a wisecrack. No one is that clever and glib all the time. As a result it gives him a lack of depth. Maggie Grace, as the President's daughter, does a good job, and her part is written a bit better. She is the one that has to draw Pearce into a level of responsibility. Peter Stormare is good as Pearce's handler and provides one of the only surprises in the film. Lennie James is Okay but has been much better in other projects. Joseph Gilgun has, by far, the most colorful character in the film. The milky blind eye, tats, thick Scottish brogue and overall crazy demeanor make him a memorable character.<br /><br />This was no cheap flick. The production values were very high so it surprised me that it sported such a low level script. This is B movie fodder to be sure, but there was still room for a level of writing that was woefully absent. And the ending. That part of a movie that suffers under even the best of circumstances is laughable at best here.<br /><br />This is a fun watch, so don't get me wrong. I at no time wanted to hit the stop button. Just check your brains at the door and gear up for some testosterone imbued good times.
0307887960|5.0|I started this diet a week ago.I work overnights and it's easy to keep to it,but when I get home after working out I really,really want fruit and starches and even whole milk.<br />I've fallen off the wagon a couple of times but 3days ago I finally got my sh%^&together.I've not got a scale but my clothes are already fitting better.This is not an easy diet because it has only one type of food that you can eat<br />but,having said that,it's already making me feel better about myself because I'm not hungry and I can eat as much as<br />I want.I can't wait to get into the cruise phase but I'm going to wait 4more days to do it.I want to make sure I don't give up and can sustain this phase without temptation.I'll post back on here in 2weeks
B00846REIS|5.0|I read Bared to You after reading the Fifty Shades trilogy. Bared to you is so much better than Fifty Shades. Bared to You has none of the BDSM that Fifty Shades had, but was still really steamy. I would definitely recommend this book!
B0052UYJDC|5.0|Miss Minimalist is an easy to read informational text with lots of practical tips on beginning a \\"minimalist\\" or less cluttered lifestyle.
B001C08RHA|5.0|I was never interested in the \\"Avengers\\" series of movies until my granddaughter brought over \\"The Avengers\\" DVD and practically tied me to the couch to watch it.  I loved it, and Iron Man was my absolute favorite character, so I bought the Iron Man DVD.  Loved it, loved the characters, and the actors were great.  I've added all the Avenger series movies to my wish list to purchase one a month.  (To give myself time to watch each one a few times before the next one comes.)  All I have to do now is live with the \\"I told you so's\\" from my son and granddaughter.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The book was pretty good. It was a little slow developing in different places. At a certain point, you will probably sort of figure out where it is headed, and you do want to finish it, just to see how it all turns out. But, none of the characters, even Malcolm, are particularly likeable. It lacks the suspense of some other Grisham books, such as The Firm, which I couldn't put down. All in all, it's an enjoyable read. On a one to ten scale, I'd give it a five.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|This is another of my favorite movies....of all time! It arrived on time and perfectly packaged. This movie has just about every version of this movie.  There are hours on hours of video extras and movie versions here.  This is a great set for the Blade Runner fan boys out there.  The effects look fantastic... Even better than when u first saw thus movie!
B0063GORYU|5.0|its a good game ....though some of the ads are adult they don't come up very often...just thought I should mention it.... that doesn't effect the game
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Even better deal! Got every version of this movie in one box! Enough said... Now you need to get one of your own because I don't loan my movies out! LOL.
B001EU79F4|5.0|I find myself listening to this album several times every year for the last 20 years.  Mellow Waits at his best. Sunset, night driving, relaxing with a friend and a bottle of wine, quiet mornings.  This album is great for any time of melancholy.
B00338QEKQ|5.0|Here we find Churchill charging onto the stage of world history with an incredible energy for one his age, taming the British Politic to harness the nation to stand against Adolph Hitler. It is focused on Churchill's point of view and what he did about it but without the varnash that comes with so many of his biographies.  He made glaring mistakes of sending more forces to France after Dunkirk, of sending two battleships into battle in the South China Sea without adequate carrier protection and within the range of Japanese bombers, he sent in four divisions to help Greece to hold against the Germans and lost Greece and Crete to boot for his effort, and playing a loosing war against Rommel until El Alamein.<br />But the things he did right saved western civilization from a new dark age. It is a familiar story, yet different in it's complexity, coherence and sweeping narrative, of a man that carried the weight of the world on his shoulders. Max Hastings is quite simply a marvelous military historian at the peak of his powers.
B004CEUEWE|3.0|AFFLECK AT HIS BEST, VERY GOOD MOVIE. HE ALWAYS ACTS WELL, AND WHEN HE DIRECTS HIS MOVIES ARE ALSO GOOD.

B008KE3960|5.0|this reminds me of Atari a little, which is to say it's a great game. there's a strategy to it that i won't give away. it's fun to work your way through the levels. unlike some free apps, you get a lot of play w/o having to deal w/ads. it's destructive but fun overall. it works great on the Kindle Fire. the graphics are solid. i can't comment on the sound since i play w/it off all the time. i recommend this if you like the challenge of different levels & relatively straightforward gameplay.
B000J103OI|3.0|I give it this rating, because it drags on some spots of the movie. other than that I like this movie a lot.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|My friend, for whom I bought this album ,lives and breathes Aerosmith, in her words \\"They may be getting older but they are as good as ever\\". So, of course, when this new album was announced, it was a must for her collection and in her opinion this is one of their best yet. So another happy customer.
B007XGJK4G|5.0|Definitely a great film focused on an individual who answered the question of what is the purpose of life? Found a way touch and influence humanity for the better.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Best app ever. Does exactly what it says - no more - no less. I can get to all my stuff from any of my computers, my iPhone, my iPad, and now my Kindle.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I absolutely loved these books! So well written, a naughty yet beautiful romance! There needs to be another sequel to these books. I didn't want to let these characters go, when the third book ended!
B004P8JPS6|3.0|Lots of army, killing, beautiful women, mystery and who done it. It was entertaining and a fun read. Like the author.
B007THA4FI|1.0|If you have not purchased JK Rowlings' new book \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" for adults, do yourself a favor - don't.  Although many of the reviews are very positive, I could not manage to plow through more than fifty pages.  The setup of the story is long and disjointed.  Vulgarities flow from the author's pen like ink.  Every page seemed to have `the F word' at least once or twice, plus other similar words.  The language does not serve a purpose that I could see.  Does she think that is what she needs to write for adults?  I did not continue far enough to discover what the story is.  I was too disgusted by the language.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|No way to change the download directory, so you are stuck with using the internal memory unless you manually move the files (but that of course breaks all your playlists). Completely insane that people have been griping about this over a year and Amazon can't even bother with replying.
0316228532|4.0|Five years ago J.K. Rowling closed up the Harry Potter series with The Deathly Hallows and now she is back with her first book outside of that series. While I still have the subject of Harry Potter fresh in your mind let me dedicate this first paragraph to a complaint. How come in almost every negative review I have read the reviewer has made some comparison to the Harry Potter franchise? And if it's not a direct comparison it's some lame joke like \\"there's no magic here.\\" Is that supposed to be clever? You wouldn't compare two different movies a director made would you? No. So don't do that with this book. It's not fair to the writer who put so much time and effort into making this piece of literature and it's not fair to you because you aren't allowing yourself to enjoy it. You're setting yourself up for disappointment. If you don't like it, don't like it because you didn't enjoy it, not because it lacked magic.<br /><br />With that out of the way let me just say wow! I was a little skeptical when I first started reading this because I didn't really know what it was about, but Rowling's books were such a huge part of my childhood that I couldn't not read it. This woman knows how to craft an excellent story with characters that you both love and hate. Then there are others that you love in the beginning and by the end of the book you want to punch them in the face.<br /><br />As many reviewers have already said this is her first \\"novel for adults.\\" When I read that my first reaction was what does that even mean? To me \\"for adults\\" means an erotic novel, so I was a little worried. Not because those kinds of books don't have a place in literature, but because it would have been a huge leap for her in terms of subject matter. Even though compared to her earlier works this does touch on more mature themes, it's feels more like she's testing the waters in this new range of topics she can work with. Which is where my first complaint comes in.<br /><br />I've seen other reviewers say this and I completely agree with them, it's exactly what went through my mind while reading this. Because she's finally able to branch out and try new things it feels a little like she's trying to prove herself. If you try to think of every mature theme you can possibly think of, it's probably in here. There's sex, rape, suicide, underage drinking, drug addiction, death, and self-harming. While I don't have a problem with any of these topics, trying to cram each of them into one novel is kind of overwhelming.<br /><br />Another complaint is that the story takes some time to pick up. When it first starts it feels crazy because you get these new characters and all of a sudden some big event happens. So while you're still getting used to this new setting there's a big commotion and it's all very exciting, but once again it's also a little overwhelming. Then once all the excitement dies down the book comes to a sudden stop and feels very boring for a while.<br /><br />The novel is set up into seven parts, a little nod to her long-time fans, with the first part taking place during the first week after the big event at the beginning. Now there's a section in part one, Olden Days, that talks about the history of the town. During this section I was really debating closing the book and giving up because it was extremely dull. I'm glad I didn't, but when you're trying to bring people into this new world it's best not start a story and then have it come to a screeching halt. Maybe having it be the novel's prologue would have been a better decision. Part two, for me, is when the story really picked up. Once I started part two that was it, i was committed and this quickly became a page turner.<br /><br />My only other complaint is that the setting of the book isn't very interesting. To tell you the truth I kept getting confused when they were talking about Pagford, Yarvill, and all of the towns. It got to the point where I gave up trying to keep up when a conversation was started about the topic. I'm going to re-read the book so maybe I'll have a better understanding the second time, but after reading it for the first time the city felt very blah. It lacked any sort of life and it ended up feeling very unimportant.<br /><br />Throughout these 512 pages you will be introduced to a lot of characters, some interesting others not so much. So many, in fact, that I found it difficult to keep up at first. Especially when you consider the fact that each of them gets around the same amount of attention, and that's not an exaggeration. The only characters who didn't get the same amount of attention as everyone else were Paul Price, the Fairbrother children, the Mollison children, and Vikram Jawanda. Personally, my two favorite characters where Andrew Price and Krystal Weedon. I won't go into detail about their stories, but I felt that they brought the most to the table. Both of them had full fledged personalities and felt like people you would meet in the real world. Simon Price, Andrew's father, has to be the character I hated the most. I hated him from the moment he was introduced in the story. Again, I won't go into detail, but he's just a huge jackass.<br /><br />Overall Score: 8.5/10 - The Casual Vacancy touches on a wide range of emotions. It is both happy and sad, evil and kind, and by the end you're sure to feel something for these characters. I've seen some reviewers say that this book is depressing, but I feel that's a bit of an overstatement. It isn't depressing, it just isn't forgiving. It wants to make you feel something and I think Rowling did a wonderful job at accomplishing that. This book is far from perfect, but it's definitely something I would recommend checking out. It may take some time to pick up, but if you pull through the slow beginning the rest of the story is very rewarding.

B009B4ZEKM|1.0|This album is a real disappointment.  It was hyped up to be Stripped 2.0, but that is a lie.  The tracks on this album are so bland and there's really no catchy songs on it.  I wasn't too fond of \\"Bionic\\", but even that album had a few catchy songs on it.  This album is just dull and none of the songs are really single worthy.  Oh well, maybe next time.

B0091REZMW|5.0|If you count the graphics, soundtrack, basic gameplay, intrinsic replay value, and the super easy multi-player functions this game gets a ten out of ten.  If you include the fun factor, its the best game out there not only for the kindle series but for portable gaming the world over.

B008BD9SI8|4.0|Abercrombie has a take on the wild west, and for the most part succeeds in creating a western movie atmpsphere. I liked that he provides closure for some of the characters, some of which I love, others irritated me without end through his whole series. What is different this time: Mostly, Abercrombie takes his characters on a redemption journey, only to let them find out at the end, that changing one's nature is nigh impossible. Most of them end up not far better off than at the start, only crippled/traumatised in some fashion in a world, where everyone has a given place, a world order once established is impossible to turn around. E.g. Byaz or Glokta come along, give everybode the proverbial \\"know-your-place - slap on the hand\\", and then business as usual. Depressing, cynical and wonderfully close to the truth. This time maybe some of them get better of ( no Jezal or Gorst )...except the ones who are dead :)
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I ordered this for myself and my wife.  I have a Samsung Note and she  has a iPhone 4s.  This thing works great!  MOF, I can hardly keep it away from my wife, as she uses it around the house, instead of having the iPhone grounded down to one charging place.  I can't testify to the longevity of this item, but as of righ tnow, and we have had it for over a month, it holds a charge for a long time and works great!  I highly recommend!

B007EE4XKI|4.0|Finally a fun TNG novel! Since the Destiny saga, the picking have been slim to say the least. David Mack was brought back to bring some major changes to the Trek universe, and boy does he deliver. Well written, rich in details, and oh so enjoyable to read. It's clear that the crew of the Enterprise is going to change at the end of the story arc. I just hope that it won't change so much (check DS9 novels) that the synergy and dynamic that made us love the series on TV, is totally uprooted.<br /><br /> Once can only hope! Btw, Worf must have done something to writers from Ronald D. Moore to Mr. Mack... That guy just can't catch a break in the romance department. Seriously, they should write him as a monk going forward, cause this is just cruel.<br /><br /> Looking forward to the next two books, and hope that Picard becomes an admiral (finally) at the end of this, but stays in command of the mighty Enterprise.

0446693804|3.0|I enjoy reading Nicholas Sparks - he can write a tender, intense story, and it's hard not to fall a little bit in love with the characters, even if they are flawed.<br /><br />A Walk to Remember is one of those rare books that I've seen the movie of before I've read the book. I try and avoid this as much as possible as usually I love the book far more than the movie, and I'd rather be let down by a movie than by a book. Unfortunately, for me, the movie was better than the book, because I didn't really like either Jamie nor Landon in the book. It's hard to put my finger exactly on why, but I think it's because I found them both a little infuriating in their perfectness.<br /><br />And that frustration spilled over into their relationship - I actually didn't really believe their love for each other, and it was more like Landon was intrigued by a girl that was so different to the other girls that he knew, rather than being head-over-heels in love with Jamie.<br /><br />It's a sweet, touching story to be sure, but I felt a little detached reading it - and perhaps in a way, the movie ruined the book for me because I wanted to feel part of the story, like I did when watching the movie.<br /><br />This won't turn me off reading Nicholas Sparks because I do enjoy his books, but it's yet another reason why I won't watch the movie adaptation of a book before actually reading the book itself.
B0079R8KXG|4.0|Very solid.  Well made.  Only critique is a little bulky.  Very nice finish.  Red color vibrant.  Sets up for reading position easily.  Like the elastic holding bands.  Very secure. Would buy again.
B007USWCXS|4.0|French simplicity reaches a powerful ending, well earned.  A very touching tale of young African refugee taking refuge in the caring intervention of a free-thinking shoeshiner.  This film challenged me to consider the tricky issue of national borders when the young cross them in search of a better life.  A remarkable achievement.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|Ive surprised myself by liking this genre.  This is book 3 in a 5 book series and it was the best one so far.  I'm hooked and want to read the other 2.  This is not a book for the faint hearted.  It is quite long, and it has a few gruesome surprises.  I can see where this makes for a popular HBO series.

They are sheer genius.<br />It doesn't take more than 1 listen to feel comfy with the new tunes, just like a favrite old pair of sweats !<br />Many of my old favorite artists have continued to release newer music, but just don't have the great sounds,<br />lyrics, or feel of their past days of fame.  If you've always loved Steely Dan , it's a must, if you've never been into Donals Fagan, it's time you treat youself to the multi genre genius of his music
B004P1JDJO|4.0|Pink does a great job in explaining in detail and with real-life examples of what drives us to be better. His explanations made it easier to understand the difference between internal and external motivation.
B008458O3S|5.0|Puzzle game where you have colored trains and try to get them to the correctly colored goals. You can merge trains or cross them to mix colors (or any combination thereof) to get to the appropriate goals. All around, the game play seems unique (at least to me, maybe there's another similar game out there somewhere). The gameplay is solid and plays rather fluid. Definitely worth a try, if you can manage it.
030771652X|2.0|At first I found the style and content of this book interesting, but eventually the sadness and repetition of the back and forth through time became plodding, depressing, and even confusing.<br />Halfway through the book I started not to care about what was going to happen.  I read some of the reviews to try to inspire me to finish.  Instead I admit that I skipped to the end and was immensely glad that I had not wasted any more time in reading this.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|I saw a number of negative reviews, so I was hesitant to get this game. Glad I tried it, though, it's definitely a good, solid, professional looking game.<br /><br />The concept is simple enough, your a jellyfish who wants to fly so you go around collecting feathers. Okay, the back story isn't that important. Basically, you build walls of some bouncy material and use those to bounce your jelly around to collect the water droplets and the feather. You need the feather to complete the level. The droplets determine your score (instead of 3 stars, you get 3 droplets for a perfect score on the level).<br /><br />The game's physics are fairly solid and the walls are not restricted to some arbitrary grid system (visible or not) like some other games. This makes the gameplay very fluid and eliminates a lot of frustration. Another thing that is very awesome in this game is that when you make a try, you see the exact route your jelly took. In this way, you can place extra walls or adjust the ones that you have based on the route you can see. Also, the route does not disappear until you begin your next attempt, unlike some other games that will get rid of the trace as soon as you start to adjust your pieces.<br /><br />All in all, I think this game is worthy of five stars, easily. I imagine some people may be concerned about the internet permissions in the game. From what I can tell, those are there because of the Facebook, Twitter, and news (presumably game news) links available in the app. I don't use such services in my apps, so I don't care to figure out what exactly they do, but I would guess it's to send updates on game achievements or other random items just like every other game that uses Facebook and Twitter does. I find it interesting that tons of computer games do this already, but if an app tries to follow suit then numerous consumers try to cry foul. Whichever. Still a good, solid game, though, if you can look past this fact.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|I was a bit surprised that a lot of folks who watched the preview to this movie were unable to determine that it's to do with the Alien universe. I find it even more surprising that throughout the entire movie, very little hint is given that the movie is actually a prequel to the Aliens movie other than indirect evidences. I'm not sure of the reason for this. Whether it's because of the fact that they can't say it belongs to Alien franchise (due to copyrights or whatever) or they don't want new audience viewers (Alien franchise is about 30 years old I think) to be misrepresented. Whatever the reason, the \\"A word\\" (known as Alien) is never mentioned anywhere in the film and not a single description was given that indicates it was part of the Alien world other than Ridley Scott directed it and that he directed Alien.<br /><br />The movie itself is rather good. At the start, we learn that Weyland Yutani, the evil  faceless company from the Aliens movie, is spearheading a research vessel to reach a planet in a far off world in space. A surprising fact about Weyland is that it was never mentioned in the first Alien movie which was directed by Ridley Scott, so I was a bit surprised that he actually decided to use this name.<br /><br />The reason for the space vessel is noble. Throughout earth, it appears there are many clues to point to a system of stars that isn't visible by the naked eye that many ancient cultures drew. It pinpoints that somehow an alien visitor must have told them about these star systems. So Weyland decided to build a ship, hire these scientists, and attempt to make contact with this far off world not knowing if anything is there or if they'll make it back.<br /><br />The movie tries to make battle between a lot of things and I think at some point it sort of falls apart. The first attempt is to try and settle the argument between science and religion. Throughout the movie, the main theme is to find the origins of earth life through these ancient aliens the characters refer to as the \\"creators.\\" The main character Elizabeth has a cross that she got from her father who died when she was young. Her mother also died early. So Elizabeth is left without family and on top of that, as a cruel joke, Elizabeth also can't have children so she's doomed to always try and find the answer to life yet at the same time she'll never be able to pass the knowledge. So with this in mind, Elizabeth is at great conflicts, she wants to find answers but she also wants to believe that there is something more than just this physical world. Many other characters try to battle this out with Elizabeth and try to say, \\"Why do you believe in god and yet know that these 'creators' are indeed your god?\\" And Elizabeth answer is, \\"What created the creator?\\" That is the entire basis of it and it's corny as anything.<br /><br />The movie itself taken a very different turn from the Aliens universe. The aliens movies, at least the first two, were about discovering a new life form that happens to be hostile. It was aimed at scaring people and on top of that produce a great movie about battling aliens and surviving. The movie Prometheus was suppose to be a prequel to explain where the aliens originated from. In the first Alien film, when the crew landed on LV426 discovered a crashed alien ship infested with what appears to be egg capsules and the lone humanoid pilot (that is much larger than a normal person) appearing to suffer a massive explosion from inside his abdomen. So the question by many fans was where did the ship come from? Who was in the ship? And that was what this movie, Prometheus was supposedly suppose to answer.<br /><br />So how did this film compare to the Aliens world? Does it answer the question that everyone had after watching the first Alien movie? The answer is no, in my opinion. The movie tries to make it that these \\"creators\\" created some biological weapon against humans. The star map that the creators told the humans was actually a biological weapon storage planet that house some biological weapon that can destroy humans and on top of that evolve to any shape and form. It turns out that the ship in the first Alien movie was actually a biological weapons vessel that house very dangerous weapons. So the movie begs more questions than answers. Why the creators decide to give humans a starmap to their destruction? Could they be upset that their creation can travel space? Or what if the creators never actually created life on earth and just gave the starmap in case life ever evolved too far? It doesn't make sense and I think this film Prometheus is indeed a prequel to another film.<br /><br />Overall I didn't like it. To say the aliens were actually evolved biological weapons might fit into the aliens world since in both films the \\"company\\" (aka Weyland Yutani) was interested in the Aliens for biological weapons. It appears in the first film, the company actually knew about the alien vessel and wanted to have it at all cost knowing that a hostile life form was on it but gave little explanation. So it was almost like the company was searching for that and never really knew where the planet Prometheus went to (or maybe it was destroyed which might be explained in Prometheus 2).<br /><br />Whatever it is, the movie was rather interesting but it fell apart in some areas. I found it to be a very visually pleasing movie. Elizabeth Shaw was a very fitting character for the film. There were some silly parts of the film but as a whole, the movie is okay and I liked it. I recommend to all Aliens fans out there.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|With all of the other hundred games based on this premise, it would be easy to overlook this one as just another clone. However, this game excels at what the others lack. Interestingly enough, the blocks are actually 3D (though you still play in a 2D plane, it just makes them look cooler). The game plays really well and is great for extended play. At first, it seemed really easy as I got to level 50 or so with like 18 extra lives. Then on the next three levels, I promptly lost all of those lives. I'm not sure if I was on a harder level or if I just did worse on the second day. Either way, fun game, you should try it. :P
B009UMTMKS|3.0|The book is very good, but it makes me quite upset that the structure is totally different than in the printed version. Chapters are split up into three different books instead of one as the printed version. This is a mess when the book is used as course literature, which I guess is quite common also for other people than me, and recommended pages/chapters are given regarding the printed copy.
0399536108|4.0|This book is a nice short read. And it was still able to include all that it needs to get it's point across.<br /><br />The book doesn't speak in poems, parables, and airy proverbs like most self help books.  It just offers awesome ways to look at life and the world from a guy who's doing a lot of the things that he loves to do.<br /><br />Whether you are a non-conformist or not, this book is great to give u an inspiration boost. It'll inspire you to clear your life of time-wasting activities and fill it with more activities that you'll value more.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was just as great as the first two were. I highly recommend these books for anyone who would like to put a little fire back in your relationship. All in all the book was excellent reading.
B005LB1MY6|5.0|When i sampled this album i found that it is more of a catchy album. The rhythm of the songs work better than their first album. Each song is of a bump and grind move and makes you wanna eurythmic to it's beat. Their first album resembles the work of Daft Punk with the noisy electronic sounds (not as much on Justice's first album), but this album has some of that style but more of a mature style with a pop synth twist (not saying their first is a imature album). Each song goes into one groovy dance tune into another. All 12 songs...even the hidden unknown named song...1 minute after track 11 ends is a better flow and better written material that won't be a wear on your ears. The three Daft Punks albums can be a once in a while feel for it in order to listen to it. The album \\"Cross\\" is not a bad album either. While this album is one that i can listen again and again too.<br /><br />Noun 1. eurythmics - the interpretation in harmonious bodily movements of the rhythm of musical compositions; used to teach musical understanding.<br /><br />P.S., If this cd is in a dvd player and your opticaly copying it to a blank minidisc like i did...the cd's text of the name of the album just comes up: Audio, Video, Disco on the display screen (maybe without the comas in between).
B001F12J48|1.0|OK, someone needs to tell you that you can't use the 3D glasses that came with Smart TV which work great.You have to use the cardboard ones that are included, and they are not good. We are going to send it back, my grand kids could only take it for 5 minutes.

B008PWUWLC|5.0|The Gripster makes it easy to watch movies, work a crossword, or perform any other task where using both hands on a mostly vertical screen makes sense. On its own, the Fire is hard to prop up on a slick surface. As promised, though, the Gripster does grip exceedingly well.<br /><br />That said, I really want a case to protect my Fire. The Gripster does that very well. The Fire easily slips into the case where a single flap holds it very securely in place. The Fire stays put in this case. This Gripster + a screen protector should keep my Fire looking new long after it's obsolete.<br /><br />If I have a knock, it's the busy look of the design. I'm not sure the two fabrics go together. However, I'm used to it now and quite happy with my Gripster.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This is by far the best Alien series movie box set yet. Amazing picture and sound quality! Worth every penny!
B008PWUYVA|5.0|This is the fourth cover I've gotten since I bought my Original Recipe Fire, and I love it the best.  I have been using the Amazon Basics Leather Folio, but this is better; it's slimmer yet more secure, and it has more flexibility in it's stand-function's viewing angle.<br /><br />PROS:<br />* Very slim and sleek; I can comfortably hold it with one hand. The front cover folds all the way back,flat against the back of the case.<br />* Very secure; the Fire slides into a sort of window opening where it is secured with velcro, and the cover closes with velcro (no straps to fuss with).  It feels very secure.<br />* Better viewing options.  It has grippy little feet that allow you to stand it up almost anywhere, at almost any viewing angle.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Kinda ugly<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  Unless you're going for glam, this little case will provide everything you need to enjoy your Fire.

B0042RJWTC|4.0|While this series was generally good with not taking too much license with altering history for dramatic effect, it certainly did make the sixteenth century more sexy. So much so, that if you have aging, well-read parents who enjoy history, but are a bit conservative in their tastes, I must advise against watching this show with them.<br /><br />We were visiting my parents for a weekend and brought along a disk to watch in the evening. Well, rather than going to bed early as I expected, they asked what we were watching, and joined in after we told them it was about Henry VIII. I thought we were in the clear until the very last scenes of the episode, when Henry fantasizes about doing the deed with Anne Boleyn in the woods. Nothing quite like the awkwardness of watching softcore porn with your parents. Be advised!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is our book club selection for this time. Lots of twists and turns. Just finished the book and it's still too fresh in my mind to know how I feel about the characters and the outcome of the story. This will definitely be a robust discussion.
B008PZ69T8|1.0|This album is to classical music what the inspiring material is to actual BDSM culture:  It is dull, and utterly unrepresentative.<br /><br />However, I suppose the college try is good enough for sexually frustrated housewives who can't be bothered to find better erotica on the internet for free.

It comes in a really sweet package with a really cool picture book insert. I can't stop listening to it. I'm in love with this album.
B00913DPW2|1.0|too much going on with little direction. i found myself just tapping all over the screen hoping to find something. confusing, boring, and stupid.
B0049VZ222|5.0|If you have not tried this show, do it now! Suspenseful, gut-wrenching, compelling...I watched Seasons 1 & 2 in just a couple of weeks.
B009LL4LMM|4.0|Why are they charging for an app just to get on the appstore app of the day.  If you go out Google play store its free.<br /><br />Why the developer would try to game the system to get free advertisement<br /><br />*edit*<br />based on response from the developer that they let me know that this is actually an ad free version which is different. I have updated my review and i am sorry to the developers for jumping to the conclusion that they where just trying to rig the system to get advertisements like many other developers.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|One hell of a lot of action. Nothing cerebral about this film just flat out kick butt action from start to stop. Definitely worth viewing.
B00914JWSW|5.0|Some really nice songs from Barbara's past.  Love the stories that are included about the songs.  A must have for collectors.
B007UWBQEU|5.0|Carrie has an excelent voice and this latest album has great lyrics. I would recommend this CD to anyone that enjoys<br />country music.

030758836X|3.0|This is a book that I really looked forward to reading. Perhaps if there hadn't been so much hype I would have enjoyed it more because I was expecting something truly special.<br /><br />Instead I found it to be cliched and predictable. Even the \\"twists\\" in the plot are not such a huge surprise.<br /><br />It's not a bad book and I don't have as much of a problem with the ending as some of the readers, but it's not going to make my top 10 of 2012.<br /><br />If you want to read a mystery that features a truly scary plot and a psychopathic character, try In the Darkest Corner by Elizabeth Haynes. That one made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.<br /><br />Is the writing on this one good? It's okay but not fabulous. The characters are all a bit too much of their particular personality to be completely believable.
