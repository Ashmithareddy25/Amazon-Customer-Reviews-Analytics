B000HBGKWE|1|Worked until the first warm day in full sunlight.
B0006H938M|5|nice toilet,easy to install
B000CIQ5DG|5|I used this pump on my Jeep Liberty CRD as a diesel fuel lift pump mounted on the frame. It was very easy to install and easy to wire into the vehicle. I used rubber mounts between the mounting bracket and frame rail. It's still a little loud, but once the diesel engine starts, you can't hear it. I also installed a pressure gauge inline at the filter head. It holds 5 PSI engine off. 3 1/2 PSI engine running.
B00CA7TPNO|2|Needed modification!  Not a stock fit..... Had to use a 2 stage epoxy!
B003D4OMLI|5|Great sound when you step on it...<br />In vehicle little loader then stick.
B001TAPLYA|5|Great product especially for the price. Very happy with them. Fit well, plus all bulbs and harnesses were included much to my surprise
B009I6CMHQ|5|Great replacement bumper for chevrolet 2002 1500HD.  Didn't have modify any attachment points.  Bolted right in place.  Very happy with its look and quality.
B00FQANS76|5|😛
B00523AMBC|1|Same with this one to tanks 40 gallons and the water came out yellow says it takes care of iron evidently it doesn't
B0024E6UE0|5|Keeps the dirt dobbers out.
B00PTQOF4W|5|Worked great
B000OCKJDW|2|Cheap and hard to see the light.  If I'd had a chance to use it before the return policy ended, I would have.
B00ZO6FF3W|4|The fit and finish of this AMG style trunk spoiler is really quite good, especially compared to the factory installed spoiler on my E350. It looks just as good and you'd be hard-pressed to not know that this was dealer or factory installed. One thing to note, there are absolutely no installation instructions, so you'll have to do some research and view a few YouTube videos to find the proper way to install. It's not a huge deal and can be done by anybody who is even slightly handy, but do be aware, there is a technique putting these on properly.<br /><br />I only have two minor complaints if any. The paint finish is  very nice but in my case the factory paint on my 2012 C250 is Magnetite Metallic Pearl Black, which has rather large metallic flakes. The metallic flakes in the spoiler paint job did not match --  they were smaller. If you look close there is a noticeable difference. I would suspect matching the factory paint on any non factory accessory would be a challenge given the large flakes of the factory paint of my car. I seriously doubt the this would be an issue with most other colors, especially nonmetallic. The other minor annoyance is that it came with about 12 inches too little of the two-sided adhesive. Installation requires two strips that run in parallel end to end. One came up about 12 inches short. Had a source more to make up for the missing length -- a bit of a pain.<br /><br />Other than those minor issues would highly recommend this easy to install,  great-looking upgrade.
B004RFKBEO|5|It is a great product Bikes are very sturdy. Caution, it is heavy and hard to set up, if you have a low car like it do, careful with dips on the road
B00NQ45228|1|It did not fit my wife's 2009 Honda Civic. I was (and I think she is) very disappointed.
B0006IX878|5|Very satisfied exactly what I wanted
B00OF68XEU|5|good quality
B004UQQMYI|5|Works great. Highly recommended when polishing glass to remove scratches.
B0023VIXNA|5|Good price and part
B00XZ9MZ74|5|Good item
B00AQZB9FO|5|Perfect.
B009H5OQAO|5|awsome!!!
B009EAB29A|5|work great on my truck
B007Y85XMG|1|Did not work, very unhappy with the product.
B00UBIMB58|1|i hate this product this is very thick and by adding water to it it still doesn't spray I should have return it but it's 2 late
B00ZYC4ELU|5|It was exactly as advertised. Works great in my Caterpillar bulldozer.
B000BN3WSI|5|Fits like a glove.
B001892VAE|4|Does what it is advertised to do. So far it has done its job well. The material that goes in between the windows my have longevity issues. It seems to be similar to those very tough automotive hand wipes.
B00K7HEIPO|5|Thanks it fit like a glove
B00UW09L8U|5|Great
B004I0YHFC|5|The quality and ease of installation were excellent.  The car looks so much better and is safer to drive at night.
B006JFR0B2|5|Just received 8/28; need to wash my car first!!! LOL......but it's just a simple decal, looks like it will be pretty simple and my Mom and I both loved dragonflies, so I'm anxious to get it on!!!  Comes in the mail like &#34;junk mail&#34; in an envelope - so don't get confused and toss it before you open it!!!
B0060WOHHY|1|I could have made what I received for less than $3.
B000DINKPQ|5|Installed on the wife's Prius . Now it sounds like a real car
B002L1H66W|5|Great product at a great price
B004HSLP1O|1|Doesn't fit the 2009!  Drivers side not a match at all.  The order link says it fits 2009-2013, however the comments from the seller say 2010-2013....so which is it?
B000O823XA|5|Thanks for the quick delivery, fine product and great price.  This tool was used for removing the valve core in the Shrader valve on a car air conditioning system.  Worked fine in removing and installing.
B001U60T9U|1|First off we have a 1994 Toyota Camry. The front seat covers fit fine, the back cover was complicated and fell apart while trying to install. They have cheaply made zippers that split in the middle. Not happy paying for a full set and can only use two covers.
B000CRO4IK|4|I put this in a thin beer koozie and it fits fine in my door cup holder. Don't fill the slots all the way, leave some slack in the spring. I filled my quarters the max and the bottom one got stuck, Easy fix, but now I just don't fill it to the max.
B00TEFKVGK|4|I was able to replace the broken part with this quite easily.  Don't expect any instructions or any additional pieces.  For the price it served it's purpose.
B0007RDVFM|4|I use this product every day in my detail shop from quick detailing after a wash, to clay bar lube. I have other standards alone preferred spray waxes that have a better finish but none are as versatile as the FX spray wax.
B008G35SZK|5|Great price, speedy delivery
B00HMGCIBE|1|The bearings do not fit comfortably in place with the mount and they are slightly loose, just enough to hear rattling and squeaking once you begin driving on them. I received replacement parts from Amazon but they weren't any better due to a flaw in the product design. I had to pay for labor twice when installing them, smh. Save your money/time and check the fit of the bearings before having a mechanic install them.
B002G1PBW8|5|Thanks for the quick delivery, fine product and great price.
B001BS9K3I|5|Came new in plastic and says it's genuine Motor craft.  Very fast shipping will buy again from seller.
B00M9ITQT2|4|The piece looks and fits fine.  Since it is chrome finish plastic I am not sure how long the finish will last.
B009JTCLDW|5|Great product.  Fits just right for my Lexus.
B00J3QP084|4|Good product for the price.
B000E2AQXA|5|K&N oil filters are a lifesaver in so many applications, simply based on the welded hex nut at the end of the filter.  Why more filter manufacturers don't do this is a mystery to me, especially considering how much time I've spent cussing at myriad machines I've owned while trying to remove the OEM filters for my first oil change...no more cussing once the K&N is installed because I know it will come off effortlessly with a simple turn of a wrench.
B004B61B34|5|Easy to install and exactly as pictures. Instructions were clear and precise.
B001O12368|5|Works great! I installed them in 20 minutes.
B000CSEWJA|5|good product
B0001XPC9U|1|Poorly made suction cup holder didn't work.
B00CSBUFOU|5|Thanks for the quick delivery, great price and fine product.
B0014YJFHA|4|VERY GOOD
B0078U7JG8|5|These are the best.  Master mechanic here
B0006301LO|5|Great product, worked well.<br />Thanks<br />Spectre
B00M9NJFXY|1|A little color pen,just good for 1/2 tyre! Expensive!!!
B00JMD4JNK|3|Definitely use manufacturer's sizing chart, fits perfectly! Nice helmet! Don't pay the extra for the Blinc Bluetooth, it's not worth it. Helmet to helmet is static-y, and overall functionality with phones is hit or miss at best.
B00LOZSDYA|5|Nice finish.
B00JRE38EA|5|These Leds are fanfreakingtastic ... bright & the work great inside my 2013 Mini ....
B0105O0KYG|5|Works great
B000C7S45E|5|fit like a glove
B00LNOTM0G|5|I went on a limb and got these for my 2015 tundra crewmax with not alot of faith in them being bright enough,but i was wrong. These things are legit and pretty bright. They even match my LED headlights perfect. I give five stars..
B00GBQYJZE|5|Sorry for an incomplete review, but I bought this pump as a spare. The pump is new and is identical to the one on my engine.
B0013JVZ7O|5|I like a lot.
B007Y882N8|5|Went in perfectly and has worked well since being installed.
B00HYJMHAQ|5|Item was as described.
B00I8R3VG2|1|Ripped when I tried to remove it
B00HQRVA9U|4|Great job and timely devilery!
B003YLMP1Y|4|GOOD
B0028JQZ5U|5|Nice sturdy creeper for the price and the adjustable head rest is just wonderful.
B00BMRRZ94|5|Works where nothing else will. Removing the plug is still a hassle but the tool is only way to get this plug out. Fortunately this plug is removed infrequently.
B00AFW0PIK|4|Great looking Hood Shield but the installation screws/material could be better.  I had to replace the hardware that came with this shield using my own hardware to ensure the shield stays on snug and allowing the hood to close fully.
B00VGL7E5G|3|The hitch is certainly versatile, but as with all Chinese manufactured products there is significant sloppiness.  Most significant in this case is that razor sharp burrs are left from the hole punch on the inside.  Beware to insure that you deburr before prior to using or you will be visiting the doctor for stitches!!
B0045WBVUM|5|Great
B00NND3NZA|5|Exelent
B003SS62PS|4|Nice auto fan for the price.
B00MJ458JI|5|I have always bought these for cars I own. These adhered strong to my Honda Fit and I have had no issues with them. Definitely helps in Florida to avoid the car from getting too warm while keeping the monsoons out.
B000NU2V22|5|Great
B001AIZ5HY|5|Works amazing. Have used this for many cars and everytime is perfect.
B0058GSWDI|5|as stated by previous buyers, this comes in the color black, which is what I preferred. the quality is good. and this is not a typical rubber mat. it seems of good quality. the only way for me to describe is maybe a cousin to a thin bath mat? it seems to be cushioned? almost changed my mind, because I thought it was too nice to put in my cargo area. but I placed anyway in my 2013 Honda fit. it is too big, but for the quality and price, I have no trouble folding over to fit. it is bigger than I thought. happy with my purchase.
B001PYI854|5|Great product, was cheaper to get the imported from the states than buy locally!
B00ARUQWMS|5|Quick shipping, good price and great product. Works perfectly
B00D9C2CDO|5|Worked out beautifully moving our daughter back to coll&egrave;ge!
B003R3RO0Q|5|Great for my Husbands classic car!
B00HNMLQAG|3|The tools were very handy in helping me remove my door panels, and also cost next to nothing.  However, the ends of the tools wore out & chipped off after only a few uses.  They definitely get the job done, but don't expect lifelong use.
B00AK9533A|5|These were great. love the way you install them. look good too!! little pricey.
B00GHT7LQE|5|This transmission pan is exactly what I was looking for. It's been about 8,000 miles after installation and it still works great with no leaks. Very good product!
B007HSMSYE|5|Absolutely love the decal! Great quality and great price. Thanks guys
B00KO32C8Q|5|Worked great. Bolted it on and away the kids went. The manual choke is a great bonus. I prefer it over the automatic choke that we replaced.
B005LXMXYW|5|super cool thanks Amazon
B004SRRY14|3|Fits good, really easy to install. Not made with high quality materials.
B0072UIU4Y|4|Once installed, it does have a lot of contact with my bumper. It is easy to install and does what it's supposed to.
B007JSGR9Y|5|This thing is awesome. It's amazing you get charged 50-75$ a visit to a auto shop to just plug one of these into your car. i just plugged it into the &#34;outlet&#34; under my steering wheel and wrote down the code issues and searched the error codes online. I was then able to clear the code as well.
B00ZDAR2DA|2|This product does not fit OEM specs. It is more narrow/shallow and does not properly seal due to the battery location.
B00KVL4QOE|3|It's a little on the flimsy side, but protects from the sun just as advertised.
B0074OWIX2|5|This was a perfect fit and it looks Great!!! These tail lights make my 2004 BMW 325i look like a brand new 2004 BMW 325i :)
B004GCZ4FY|5|The fit is a teensy bit small, but not noticeable!
B00R0AXOWE|4|It looks as described. I have not used it yet since it's still summer.
B00279OSDW|5|great
B00R1J66JM|5|Almost perfect well worth the savings!
B00QIC7XW2|4|Serves the purpose but takes a long time to come from China.
B0002ZGBRE|5|Not sure why more people don't use fusible links anymore? A fusible link protects the wiring itself from the battery or power supply up to the fuse or breaker panel. Can't tell you how many times I have seen or replaced melted wiring harnesses that could have been prevented with a fusible link.<br />Many people think the fuse or breaker in cars is to protect everything, but it's not. Those are there to protect the equipment and the wiring from the fuse/breaker to the equipment but NOT from the fuse/breaker back to the battery or power supply.<br />Would recommend a fusible link on older model cars & restoration projects. A general rule of thumb is to use a link approx. 6&#34; long that is two sizes smaller than the wire you want to protect coming from the battery. So a 10 AWG primary wire would need a 14 AWG fusible link.<br />When wiring cars, I recommend fusible links, reset circuit breakers (like ones offered by Blue Seas) and upgrading grounding systems.
B00PMXQFE0|5|well built light good colour
B000COCRTQ|5|They worked.
B00032K9R4|5|Look great on my 1966 Fairlane GTA !!! Great price and product !!
B000COBC6U|5|Got for my 86 K5 blazer, this with some LED lights really brightens it up (only needed one but after how good the first one was I replaced the one in the back too, it was yellowish).
B0092KVYGI|3|my second one ,, first one failed after year..good price
B00EDFM5QU|4|These work great, but are difficult to seat into light socket. Some that haven't read the reviews from others might think they don't fit but they do.
B004JBYW7S|5|Came with everything, including extra washers.  Has the &#34;lip&#34; that  fits the bracket to keep it securely in place.  Not much else to say other than it looks just like the original filter, except for the color.<br /><br />The bottom bolt will be VERY hard to remove.  Which is probably why they sell wrenches specifically for fuel filters.  But if you have the right wrenches you should be OK.  You'll need a 10mm and 14mm for an Integra.
B00CJUW3HW|5|Love it just what I wanted.
B009XRQK5U|4|GREAT
B0023XIKLS|5|excellent
B00NQHZ0WC|5|This was a very good purchase!!! The look AMAZING! Very bright, affordable, easy to install!! I wouldn't get any other DRL Light Bar besides OPT7. The peel and stick is very useful so I don't have to drill holes and mount a bracket, that's a huge plus in my book! Overall, AMAZING lights that I would recommend to anyone who is looking for DRL Bars. ALPHA!
B00DRHM9D4|5|Trunk spoiler looks great and paint matches perfectly.  Ordered the Black Sapphire Metallic (475) and looks like an OEM part.
B000BUQODG|5|This is a great addition to trailer, we keep vent open 24x7 when stored and moving, camping unless using heat/AC. When we open it up after being in storage lot, it now smells fresher and keeps heat down. Its no taller than the AC unit either, installs easily just have to keep track of nuts.
B009AA2FAY|5|Perfect fit and installed in minutes
B00K1XMCXE|1|Use once the Long reach pliers slowly become load them bend slightly so not meet at end.... Made in N. Korea or? ?<br />Garbage
B00GSAUHB8|4|Works fine the shade but it os a Little bit hatd tonfond and store
B000X21Z7W|5|This expensive mat was a perfect fit in my 2015 Forester, and very well made.
B006NES8XS|4|I read the reviews before I  purchased.  Just received them and put them on the car.  3 installed without issue.  1 kept popping off when I tried to install it.  To fix the problem, I took the retaining rings off my original covers and added them to the new covers.  Double retaining rings seems to have done the trick.  The final cover installed without an issue.  They look great!  The picture shows the 2 retaining rings.  Put them on each lug retaining clip on the back of the wheel cover and that should hold them on the car.
B00K6BGI90|2|Pump works great but wrong wiring. I had to switch plugs out wich was a pain
B00VMU5LQA|3|Worked great. But have a pink tint.
B000CCMKZY|5|very good
B00G620ZVU|5|Very decent for price
B0041CDORE|1|I just installed this powrpro on my 05 Roadking last evening it took about an hour and a half.  I had a tough time reaching the connections on the fuel injectors.  Reading all the comments about this wonderful product quickly turned to less thrilling.  I took the bike out for a five mile ride and during decel the bike was still popping.  I quickly called the tech dept at cobra and he told me it could possibly be an exhaust leak.  So I completely disassembly the exhaust system and found no issues.  So once again I took the bike out and no change.  I called cobra and this time no answer closed until Monday.  At this point I'm am not a believer that this product claims to be what is advertises. I was hoping at least very little to no popping on the decel.  Sorry at this time  I can't comment on any positive aspects of this PowrPro CVT FI 2000.  I will once again contact Cobra first thing Monday, until then I have no choice but to remove it and go completely stock exhaust and all.
B000BYEJSY|5|What can I say MOE!!
B00EKKJCM8|4|Good value.
B0081V0BQI|5|Great product. Installed a month ago and works great. Very well built.
B0001CKHYG|1|fits fine, doesn't do anything to protect my camper. I pulled off my cover and my camper was filthy, and the dust/dirt was baked on and left discoloration, I ended up having to hand scrub the white back. Into the garbage this went.
B0083CJAOO|4|good price and product.
B00FQXKFOC|2|Poor quality,received with one latch broken on the case, two of the adaptors broke on first use, I was able to put one back together with a new c clip, the other may or may not work again. The coupler on the hose snaps on to tight and is extreamly hard to remove. Not impressed!
B00JXAH7NQ|5|This is my second Shorai Battery that was put in a Suzuki Burgman AN650.  The first was a Vespa GTS250  Rapid install due to its lightness.  Build in bolt base made the wire attachments amazingly fast.  Included all the necessary screws possibly needed.  Powerful starting power.  My Vespa experience is that it starts with no effort and never needed charging even though off season.
B00HYD9VF6|3|Matched the color nicely, but very hard to get into ONLY the scratches
B00WWCFZWM|5|Amazing replaced my pile of junk hids for these 2x as bright replaced on 2005 toyota tundra took me 15 min with riping off my old hids and brackets this is super easy its just plug and play will never buy hids again thanks
B00CFALFXY|5|great quality, and great colors
B00A7E9P3M|5|Good led lights
B0008F671S|5|I wanted a 2&#34; receiver for my tractor and this worked perfectly.
B00LIDY5HW|5|Very cute forr my car
B007LICJ0S|5|Had one of these before that started to corrode and loved the style.<br />New car, new teeth!<br />Put them on the front as the teeth cover up tag year.<br />Besides, why would you put teeth on the BACK of a car???
B000GGL4JY|5|Looks very classy on my MB SUV
B009AA2GQC|5|2004 Chevy Avalanche
B0049C9LN2|3|Item different as described, it is non-greasable as stated in description
B002H5PW6S|1|Did not receive the lanyard pictured. Disappointed. Made cheaply.
B00513G82U|4|Better than expected quality for this price point
B00GWFKMY6|5|Work great!
B00JC1TLLC|5|thank you
B00BY24M3O|5|Ok
B009IKAARQ|1|Get this product if you don't mind constantly picking the cup holder on the floor and someone knocks it from the window.. Elongated the hook part using folded clear packaging tape and that helped a lot.
B00LNDIAMI|5|Works great/  Replaced light that popped off my camper while putting it in the garage.
B00APOCKBI|5|Good quality shipped quick
B0041388UG|5|Well made unit, I didn't need fold down but this is superior to the cheaper units that are not as tall, you need to keep the tire off the ground when going in/out of graded entrances! Looks well made and only a slight bit of wobble from lower square tube bolt, but I torqued it down more to stop it, see if that holds. The hole could have been smaller to avoid this. Holds tire great. Combined with the tire cover I got here too, looks great.
B004P9F8MM|1|Doesn't fit correctly on unit.  Came in wrong color.  Falls off repeatedly.  Poorly made overseas.  All around waster of money.
B004J6G3YI|5|So far, so good. I have about 500 miles on them and they are SILENT. Easy to install and seem to provide great stopping power. I would recommend these for what they cost.
B004940ZSK|5|Exactly what we needed
B0075XI71O|4|Good tool easy use
B00BCH4WWC|5|I use these for spraying phosphoric acid and bleach.<br />I mix up my own homemade rust buster (penetrating spray) from 2 parts acetone with one part tranny fluid.<br />These crater in shorter order spraying acetone.
B00P6OOAC4|5|Parts fit my 1998 Camry v6 perfectly. My car is a little higher on the rear because the front still has the old struts. Two months later parts still hold up well.
B005HR17RG|5|Works fine fits perfect
B002BFVOCA|5|Have used it for years! Never fades, even here in the Texas sun! If it gets dirty, just hose it off. Dries super quick. I am deathly allergic to mold & mildew, but with this rug, there are no issues.
B00BJJZQ3C|5|It fits perfectly
B00UC7OYKI|5|Arrived when expected, parts were what I needed to fix my 4 wheeler.
B00CKZUMTM|4|Bit pricey for what it is, which isn't much once you inspect it.<br />Easy to install. Very easy actually, just use a hacksaw.<br /><br />I sound like a Harley-Phag now; less &#34;close calls&#34; with idiots who can't pay attention on the road.
B0083LIKU0|4|All in all it is a nice mat for outside our travel trailer. Some flaws in the stitching, one side is worse than the other. This mat would work best on a cement pad. We put it on a dirt lot and when we sat in our camping chairs the feet of the chair left divets in the weave of the mat. They did come out when we straightened the mat. I wouldn't want to do that to often. I'm afraid that eventually the divets would become permanent. It's not as tight a weave as the one we replaced. I only replaced the other one because of size and color.
B000HAUWL0|5|I like the built in gauge.
B004SFKJIQ|5|Had to set up a prota potty at a ground breaking event for Fort Comfort Veterans Village on Route 66 n Arizona www.veteran-village.org and the nearest bathroom was six miles away - this worked perfect for our guest - potty and tent combo - perfect for the job
B00LG07MZE|5|Purchased for a Buick Enclave, it is a bit large but perfect for quick install/remove.
B004I0Y9SM|5|Fit perfect on the Dodge Neon and was easy to install which makes this a perfect purchase if you are in need of one
B00KQEHHQU|5|Excellent engine oil in convenient easy pour container.
B0002SRDR8|5|AAA+++ just as ordered!
B000EQTZU6|5|Worked perfectly
B00EB6ZC2K|4|Nice axles,
B0083H4SMI|5|Extreamly happy.  Works great and easy to install.  Good price and decent shipping.  Would buy again.
B00RXVDUZG|5|They are beautiful. I am very happy with this product
B009RC2HVC|5|I received my new tailgate latch assembly 3 days after ordering and was pleasantly surprised that it fits and works perfectly. I paid less than 15 dollars and it's no different than the $80 part from the dealership.
B003BZD08U|5|does the job intended
B007P72SRE|4|good deal
B00CHDFM0Q|5|Great.  Fit perfect.  All arrived as expected.  Wonderful.
B00HZB9ME2|4|They are pretty good decals. Look great. The only thing is that they have already started to peal/lift off around the edges only after a month.
B00KV1UDOG|3|Its a good quality product, but it's kind of large for my small SUV<br />Be great on a larger Pick-up or Full Size SUV
B00CM589B8|5|This is like the ones we used as a kid when we worked and the local gas station when we washed and hand dried cars. Cleans windows perfectly. Better than anything else. Must have to remove water to keep from spotting.Excellent quality.
B00332GN62|4|They fit perfect on the truck. I like them a lot they look good I just wish they would have put double Stickam tape on all of it not just 90%.
B00PV5GHHO|5|perfect
B00ZB5IVX2|5|Shipped fast! Nice product!
B005DUMLZE|5|Goodyear finished product. Cant find any bad on it.<br />I installed it and toked a ride with dynojets Powervision in autotune mode. It detects overall a bit more air capacity in the VE table. That promise a more possible torque.
B00HJ15AFS|5|This was for my friend the dog bone is a bit large and it looks silly but she loves it!
B004BVBK6W|5|Really well constructed material, difficult to install on round headlights (Hummer H2). Excellent choice though.
B000HYL20G|5|Very nice tool to have around to help keep tiny parts collected while working.
B002MF2FZE|4|They were  easy to install with the normal pulling and tugging at plastic car parts around head lights.  That was expected and would be the same for any head light.  The only difficulty I had was adjusting the passenger side headlight beams. The adjusting screw is difficult to reach.  The low beam was adjusted to its maximum height but was still too low.  The owners manual on my Hyundai Elantra had instructions for adjusting the headlights.  Not bad for after market product.  Note that on my car even the old passenger beam was adjusted low so it may be that the whole headlight box needs to be tilted somewhat, so I would not blame this on the headlight but the car.  If the beam adjustment was easier I would give 5 stars.  Not all after market products have the adjustment screw in the same location or orientation.
B000NCOKQK|5|Good product
B0041CE8TM|4|Works got idle droning down by reversing the Silencers.  FZ6 is a torque review little beast, any throttle and it goes a good buzzing to a roar in the helmet.  Better than that migraine giving pipes made in Colorado. And the race sound is nice for ladies lookers. People not so annoyed by my idle or cruising now!
B003NWSNPG|5|remove and replace broken unit with this one. no issues, as advertised
B0052XT13M|5|The product is in perfect condition and works great with Delta seatbelts. I do not know if it works with other airlines seatbelts because we only fly Delta. We have used our extender seatbelts twice and each time they worked flawlessly. Most of the time we do not need the seatbelt extender, but it give us peace of mind to know that if a seatbelt on the airplane happens to be short (for whatever reason), we have our seatbelt extenders in our carryon bags to us at our convenience. One does not need to be overweight to need a seatbelt extender. Sometimes airplane seatbelts become damaged and the airline just shortens the seatbelt to fix it rather than replace it. This can lead to a seatbelt that fits too tight even for a person that is slim. If one travels much by air (such as my wife and I), a seatbelt extender is well worth the money and peace of mind. It is not fun to ask a flight attendant for a seatbelt extender in front of the other passengers sitting around you. Having one's own seatbelt extender resolves this issue.

B0009IQZFM|4|Good microfiber drying towels for car.
B005M22432|5|great product fit perfectly well also came with gum.<br />great purchase
B008ESOQZU|5|Drained and refilled my Land Rover Discovery 2 power steering.  No change in the function but the fluid is now clean.
B00M78820I|5|Very happy with my sunshade!  Update.  Its just too hard to fold.  I don't have the patience.
B002669TU8|5|As described. Quick shipping.
B00OT59NFK|4|As stated before the hole for the temperature sensor is in the wrong spot iy is drilled for the front but the wire is not long enough if you purchase this product you will need to use a oil cap plug on the front hole and redrill the back to allow for the sensor other then that I have no other complaints I have seen an improvement in Gas mileage btw auto zone should have that plug and I would get a hole saw from lowes the ones they got there really suck
B002N5POF6|5|Works great.

B000KPW4TK|4|Fits well and and tends to stay where it belongs.
B00KGEW1M0|2|they have turned some sort of red color around the edges and where your feet go.  Very strange.  they are in a garage kept vehicle so no sun damage as would have been my first thought.  They aren't very thick either.  just not what I expected or wanted
B0058V5VJG|5|This is great not needing two separate fuse holders.  I would definitely recommend.
B000BR3BOY|5|Good buy
B0051MYLS4|4|Good product
B000XY17CI|4|Easy install. Took about 10 minutes for both pegs. Major improvement over stock pegs. Comfortable to ride with open or closed.
B00KQSM7VG|5|Fixed my issue 2014 grizzly 700 displayed error code 12 on pod.
B002MTTO72|5|The dyno proves that my engine is making more horsepower with Gibbs oil
B00KMBPA9I|3|I broke one the first day, oops
B00OXWZ60A|5|Worked as advertised. My f150 has no catalytic converters to improve the exhaust tone, and this set the check engine light off. This helped me pass emissions for much cheaper than a pair of cats. My check engine light is still off months later.
B0063U45K2|5|Perfect fit for a 2000 Beetle with the 2.0 AEG engine.
B0061SBRP2|1|cheap,  i can't believe adidas put their name on something so cheap
B00A66GYDA|5|THIS IS A MUST HAVE PRODUCT FOR THE DIY HOME MECHANIC AND THIS PRODUCT WILL SAVE YOU LOTS OF MONEY TO SEE WHAT THE CODE IS STATING WHEN USING THIS PRODUCT. I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT THIS A LONG TIME AGO.
B009XFDYNS|5|Bought it to replace the auxiliary battery in my Mercedes Benz E500.  So far I've been using it for several months without any kind of trouble nor efficiency drawbacks...
B00IMQQXLO|5|This was purchased for a friend at the dealership I work at. He could not find this cheaper anywhere. It was perfet for his needs and he was very happy with it.
B003DNJ728|1|Product described as water-repellent, definitely not. I bought this for my classic car that has a leaking window seal and this was the temporary fix for it, but it is pretty much useless since it leaks through the cover, through the window seal and into my car. I also searched car covers specifically for my car, and chose this one, but it is WAY to big. Make sure you store your car indoors if you want to use this cover, plus dont trust the car fitment guide.
B0006299I6|4|Perfect!
B00QYBSS2G|5|I bought this for my Nissan altima and I get complements all time! Loving it
B000E4OMXI|5|Installed myself in 10 minutes, worked great
B003U2KNZC|3|Pricey item with barely any usefulness.
B001RMT5Q0|5|Easy to install and adjust. Best purchase for both my Tauruses!
B00WO8XNOG|5|It's amazing this ever, just bought it for my boyfriend he's a batman fan, it sticks well on the console love it recommend this product to everyone, didn't take a great amount of time to get here like it says when it comes from China still got here fast. Don't think about it buy this product!
B00510GGIE|2|I loved them when I got them but the elastic is loose and its too big now and the color is fading...need some more.
B00475KM7K|5|Put it on the tank of my motorcycle  looks great !
B006X8BA34|5|Wow.. the picture supplied looks great BUT the actual grille looks even better! I purchased this for our dealership for a used Nissan to help move the car and it did! An accessory, at a small price that enhanced the car to move it! Well worth  the prices spent!
B00PXESV2W|5|Just as described & speedy delivery! Thank you!
B00B1M96RO|5|I would like to use my visa card
B000CAINDE|3|for the pice it is ok
B000ABADXI|4|Great quality screwdrivers and came within a few days of order. These would be great for anyone's tool collection or as a gift. I purchased these at full price for personal use.
B002UWHP86|5|It is exactly like the original 1973 Dodge van wiper motor.  IT fit and works perfectly although it was listed as &#34;does not fit&#34;.
B000FOJSHW|5|Good stuff
B000CP8EYW|5|Yes it meets my expectations.  In the past, I had my oil pump fail and I drove over 100 miles with only the 20W-60 protecting my engine.  The bike never broke down.  I'm definitely convinced that this is the best oil yet, especially for my '81 Harley Davidson shovelhead.
B005JJ0D22|5|Fixed a lot of problems I had been having for a long time, sluggish take off ,erratic shifting, poor throttle response. It's like a new truck.
B002PWJRWS|5|perfect
B0054T95ZS|5|High quality and easy to identify positive and negative terminals with the black and ref paint. Heavy and well built product from AC Delco.
B00DT8E358|5|THEY WORK GREAT FIT GOOD SO FAR HAPPY!
B0091OE6II|5|New, so do not know if they will last it not.
B00BLPT176|5|keeps the scratches off
B005KDO8U0|5|Received next day works perfectly
B00VASUYRK|5|Was installed w no problems drives perfect no complaints
B00PXZ919I|5|This is first DA I've ever used. Came with the stiff backing plate installed, so after switching to the flex backing plate and throwing on a brand new hex logic pad, I was good to go. Minimal vibration from what I experienced, and the handle fits comfortably in my hand. I read that some people had difficulty by accidentally changing the speed due to the way the handle is, but I never had an issue with it. I think this was money well spent and it looks and feels like a quality piece of machinery. I would absolutely recommend this to a beginner or intermediate looking to polish up your paint.
B00GGXFZ7I|5|Great product  shopped fast
B00AHA4YWI|5|Smells tasty and simply works. Sprayed my hex logic pads liberally with this cleaner and let soak in a sink full of hot water for 15 minutes. Ran water over them and all the residue came out, leaving the pads looking like brand new.
B001FIDNGO|5|I keep slamming my seat belt in the car door and these work perfectly to replace the existing part.
B008FUU53Y|4|Plates frames look great on the Tacoma. Only thing I was a little disappointed in was the fact that the &#34;Tacoma&#34; lettering is actually a metallic sticker, run you finger across it and you can feel it raised. My TX plates fit perfect in the frames and there were no issues on fit as other reviewers have had.
B00COE3Z8E|5|Fits our rear window perfectly.
B0009H519Y|5|Tested against two other aluminum polishes I had. This is far and away the brightest, also the easiest (less polishing off the haze)
B008I7OBKW|4|Over all, good.
B00IPS3IJO|5|Fantastic...only blade I will use anymore.
B00LIDY5HW|5|Product Just as advertised, very funtional
B00LHB08C6|5|Cute sticker. It was easy to apply to the car.
B00LBAC5S8|4|Truly happy with this product and a great addition to a Wrangler soft top. Only negative is the Manufacturer states you never have to remove the shade to close the top, which is true, but you do have to remove the 2 front spiderballs in order to latch the top which can be a pain to replace every time. Some of the rigidity and support is lost without the front left and right spiderballs but it does stay in place with just the center footman loop attached.
B00MJ89ZYS|5|Product
B00WGORBZ0|1|If an item is listed as specific to a model and year of a car, you would think that it would fit.  Especially at this price!  This sunshade is too deep top to bottom to fit snuggly in the windshield.  It can be kind of propped up with the visors.  I am extremely disappointed.
B000AL8VD2|5|good
B00HWNCFZ6|4|As described
B0018E6T0M|5|My hubby loves these!! Bought as part of anniversary gift :) they're exactly as described and seem durable. I would recommend this product to any OSU fan!! GO BUCKEYES!!!!
B00KB5G0EO|5|I haven't actually used it with cleaner yet, but it has already removed the streaks from the inside of my windshield that have been driving me crazy for the past couple of weeks!  I have no doubt that it will work exactly as it needs to!
B000IYPSOG|5|Perfect fit, seems to work well. not much more to say.
B000CITK8S|1|I was getting ready to order this or one of the more &#34;deluxe&#34; versions of the battery tender for my BMW  M Roadster that spends most of it's time under wraps. I guess all the advertising and puffery I have seen on the many TV auto shows had sold me that there product was the best. Whenever I buy something on Amazon I always look at the worst reviews starting with the newest in case a products &#34;problems&#34; have been corrected in an update or their product has become less reliable. You can usually easily pick out the ignorant ones or the operator error ones. However, when I ready the 2011 review by Sterwat S, I was dumbfounded. When I read the only reply ever posed by Deltrans &#34;Dawn&#34; I was double dumbfounded. I have no problem (other than the US apparently can't or won't compete with China in many areas} with buying non US made. But when I read the &#34;warranty&#34; provisions, the shipping costs, the review fee I couldn't believe it. The single, never changed response from &#34;Dawn&#34; sealed the deal for me. Any simple electronic item like this that can't offer at least a 2 year no question warranty, even if you have to pay shipping, is a product whose company is not very proud of it or its quality. I have a $5 charger that will do most everything the Deltran will do but thought I would &#34;treat&#34; the M to a new one. Well, I think I still will but it for sure will NOT be a Deltran product. Perhaps they should take some of the advertising money and invest it in a better product they can stand behind for 2 years or a &#34;warranty&#34; whose customer cost doesn't exceed the cost of buying a new one. This is simply corporate ignorance and a true Kiss M A to customers that have likely now become non customers.  FYI, I also caught my companies  proposed 100 battery tender fleet contract we were about to award to a Deltran retailer. With units, installation, etc that was a $110,000 contract that we will now rebid excluding any Deltran product. Good corporate sense Deltran!. Good corporate sense Deltran!
B000C9SR90|4|Fits
B00BAYQOA0|4|I'm mixed about this product.  They fit well, and look like they were designed specifically for the SUV (2015 Rav4 limited). As others have mentioned, there are no instructions which is OK for me this time. They do come with mounting screws, but I found that they were too small in diameter to secure the front mud flaps to the car.  The rear ones fit with existing screws in the car, no drilling!  The front mud flaps have a tab for the underside to secure it to the car but on my RAV limited, there was no where for a screw to go to hold it on. There was a hole in the plastic under the door sill but no where to secure the screw.  I went to an auto-parts store and purchased a package of 2  M6-1.0 Speed nuts with long flanges (Dorman 454110BP) and put them on the car before I mounted the mud flaps.  Then installed the M6-1.0X25mm  (Dorman 455930BP) bolts with affixed large washers, to hold the bottom of the mud flap to the car. Shorter screws would have worked as well.  I said I was mixed about this purchased, because I had purchased these on the 9th of August and had an expected delivery date of 24 August to 21 September!  When I send a message to the vendor asking why it was so long for a part that was supposed to be in stock, there was no response! They finally arrived on the 25th.  I don't think I'll purchase any other products from this vendor due to no response and very long delivery dates.
B00BJH3V0O|5|Perfect fit for my F150!... Love it.
B0077FJA20|4|Great price , but need a bit of modifying to fit factory brackets.
B00RHQBNGA|5|Now why didn't I invent these?  Ingenious.  Great way to utilize door cup holders.  Love, love, love!
B00MFFWZ92|1|Junk
B00K1CRO2Y|1|This is a Chinese-made part by a company called OEM and NOT the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) part.<br /><br />The picture shows a VW AG labeled part with part number, but this is not what you'll get.  The part that arrives has just a single number printed on the side.<br /><br />My 2007 2.0T had two different coil pack failures with a couple hundred miles of each other.  I replaced one with a Duralast, and another from a source I can't remember, and then decided to replace the last two with actual VW parts while also replacing all four plugs.  A couple hundred miles later, one started acting up again.  It turned out to be the one from a source I can't remember, and it turns out that it looks just like this &#34;OEM&#34; part I just received.  I assume this over-priced &#34;OEM&#34; part will also die soon.
B00HW58R92|5|I installed a backup cam on my car, and these tools came in handy! I'm glad I purchased them. They're really great for popping out car parts without scratching.
B000C3BB26|1|Contrary to what Amazon and Hayden say, this does NOT fit on a 2011 Ford F150 5.0 liter Coyote engine. None of the bushing for the engine adapter fit. I don't believe there's enough clearance for ANY bushing to work with the supplied engine adapter. I'll try to find one that works elsewhere when I'm ready to change the oil again.
B000MD4YKM|5|Goes together easy. Well made. Dispenses grease. The instructions were thorough.
B00VIVITHG|3|Ok but not as sturdy as original
B006R7AW6M|5|Great product. Took me maybe 30 to install it. Very easy to install. They are made of some hard plastic. So far have about 1000 miles on them and no compaints, squeaks, or anything of that sort. Will for sure buy again. (If needed).
B00HXO05D8|5|Quality product.
B00L9J2J6E|5|This product it Awesome. This is the second time that I ordered it. I strongly recommend this product.
B00T36HLYU|5|Fits snug...good view or rear with 26 ft trailer
B0007LVJ2A|1|Like others, when I needed to unlock, it fell apart.Don't waste your money.
B001F0IE7A|5|Bolted right up, works like a charm
B009CYB2YS|4|Great modular for the price. It feels solid enough, opens easy and the built in sun visor helps on sunny days. I gave it 4/5 stars because I was getting more wind noise that I would have expected. I bought my helmet according to the size charts and it fits snug.
B0066RY3UY|1|It fits great but after a couple months it started leaking from the seams where it was put together then it exploded.
B00J9PKYYE|5|Nice fit and style.  Looks good on the new Jeep Willys edition.
B002ZTNVB4|5|This fits so perfect. It was one of the first things I bought after I got our new van and with in a week it had already saved the van 3 big spills. And since the van has stow and go seats if you spill juice on the floor it's going to leak through in to the storage and be a pain you'll never fully get clean. Worth every penny even if it cost twice as much. Biggest issues are if you actually plan on using the storage compartments or folding away the seats it is a bit of a pain to have to move it out of the way. Not terrible but definitely annoying but if you have car seats like me those seats never go down and only emergency supplies go in that storage compartment
B00CG5RYEW|1|This sticker sucked I couldn't even put it on my car when I peeled the paper off it stretched and looked like s***
B00LBNL3VK|1|These bulbs are marginally brighter than regular bulbs, and pretty much the same brightness as a ten pack of 10smd bulbs that cost the same as this pair. They're closer to 6k in color. I bought these in February and one bulb is already burnt out. No issues with the 10smd bulbs that I've had installed longer than these.
B000FW62PA|5|Thick and sturdy, great for my long commute with the bumps. Stays in place for the most part, once it loosens up we just used some glue dots to hold it in place.
B00XXUFO7I|5|One of the best light bars really bright
B004DEBBPM|2|The extension was defective, the holes for the pins were offset, I had to bore them out in opposite directions (up and down) with my drill press and add weld  tacks to one side otherwise my receiver and kayak extender would have sat at a nearly 45 degree angle and it was sloppy, the weld tacks I added were to remove the slop so it wouldn't  move while turning as I drove.  I didn't bother to return it because I needed it when I received it, however after all of the work I performed on it made it functional which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of the 1 that it really deserved.
B00K74STWK|4|Works great, standing up well in the hot Arizona sun!
B00ONDM07G|4|This is exactly what I needed. It fits my iPhone 6 plus easily and I still have full use of the tray. It also has a mount for a dash cam. I have yet to use that, but could come in handy if I decide to get a GoPro for some trail rides. The only thing that keeps me from giving this five stars is the fact that there's no screw in point at the bottom of the tray if you've installed an aftermarket stereo. It still works as expected, but is not as locked down as it would be if it were screwed into the dash somehow.
B00E16M1S8|5|Fit my 2007 Prius very well. Would buy again. Review the instructional video clip before installing
B00CCYWPXC|5|Amazingly great stuff.  The label has a long list of bodily fluids that it neutralizes, and it really works.  This cleaner contains enzymes so it may not remove set stains, but it is the optimal product to use if you are cleaning up fresh stains from flooring or furniture.  I have even used it in the rinse water of my carpet cleaner.  One gallon becomes eight after you dilute it according to the directions, so it conveniently lasts for quite a while.  I have bad dogs so I've tried them all, and this cleaner is in a league of its own.
B010154KUY|5|MKV GTI these were an exact fit!! the bulbs that came with it are so so I had hids already installed and they fit snug they did need adjusting to get them right though I really like the adjustment bolt on these a couple turns and perfect also overall quality is solid the look and feel is better than the stock ones imo so I would definitely recommend these as a direct upgrade over stock fogs
B007Q1JKJS|5|As described this pulley fits my Chevy and so far everything is fine.
B00GZR4N0K|5|Bought for my 95 nissan maxima, it arrived on time and was quality well made product. At first i thought there was a problem because there is only one wire going in to the conector that attatches to the knock sensor. I contacted them and they immediately got back to me and reassured me that it was correct and was suppose to be like that. I removed my old harness and in fact it was identical. I installed it and the car started  right up. Running better than it ever has! Would recommend this to anyone and would buy it again. Saved a ton of money and didn't have to sacrifice quality! Satisfied customer!!
B000M0K8DM|1|I purchased thinking the photo was a  representation, of the item. The hose fitting is barbed and not An -6 an fitting
B007USCM7E|1|This is a waste of money and time. I recharged my car using this and I noticed leaks coming out of the trigger, connector to the can, and connector adaptor for the low line. Drips of freon coming out. Recheck seals and can but everything was tightly assembled. System was half full because everything else escaped. Sooo disappointing. For the amount of money this is so not worth it. Never will buy anything from this manufacturer.
B00TPKNREM|5|Very Quick shipping great starter for Cub cadet gt1554.Took about tens and was up and running!
B000E24APU|5|Worked as promised. My furniture looks new after using this product. Thanks
B007P4V7A6|5|Great product! Virtually a snap to install (less than 5 minutes). They're strong to lift the rear door/hatch of the van smoothly and hold it there!<br />Shipping was fast and packaged nicely!
B003NZ9E5Q|5|Great helmet at a great price, this is second one we've bought and couldn't be happier!
B000C9QPAS|5|Replace old one with no problem
B00CXADGQ0|5|Not very bright
B00B0Z15IA|5|This came sooner than expected, fit perfectly. Good item that's cheaper than going through a dealer.
B009Y7MJVS|5|Easy to mount, stays stuck and no issues going through tolls.
B0049KZJ4O|3|fit prefect on my freestar mini van. This was for the rear  though and needed the front. driver passenger side.  Does not come with the copper washers but still way cheaper then any parts stores.
B009FREAGO|2|I got this for a simple trash bag for the car. It works ok but the configuration is somewhat weird. It opens narrow at the top, but the base is set to expand and stay expanded due to the insert. So, even when not full it is bulky and intrudes on the back passenger.<br /><br />I used it a bit then tossed it. Looks kind of cheap and bulky for my purposes.
B000C9LOHW|5|works good
B0084UJHTS|5|These mud flaps are a really nice addition to my truck they fit great and follow the contours of my oem fender flares very nicely and block mud from getting on my nice chrome exhaust tip very nice product
B000HE6H3S|5|Great hose
B000C0WOY8|2|Part will not fit a 2001 expedition.  Waste of time.
B0146RKKYI|5|These boots are the best for the price!! I brought 3 pairs!!!
B00029JYS8|3|Died on me after a few months of usage.
B0001MQ7FO|1|This so-called &#34;battery saver&#34; was a battery killer for me.  On the first use, it overheated and drew my battery way down.
B00KCQSOAA|5|Good！👍
B00AXH5Y5G|3|I had to buy two of these because the first one broke a screw off in the mount. I believe it to be very cheap. Bad quality control.
B005XOZ63O|1|Was not cut to fit in the frame.  Broke within two days.
B000QJJ452|4|Bought this system about 2 years ago. Had it professionally installed and I loved it. It has basically zero drone inside the cab unless you're on a highway doing 70, then it will have a minor drone but nothing terrible.<br /><br />I recently had the same shop cut out the 50 series muffler that came with this package and install a 40 series. I wanted something that made my truck sound more like a truck.<br /><br />Good kit if you're looking for a moderate sound... Not if you're looking for that &#34;truck&#34; sound
B0048DYACO|1|Was wrong item for my car but was under the 2015 Nissan Rogue, had to send it back and pay return shipping
B00WAK23B2|5|I get compliments whenever I use this bag. Durable and rolls really well. Good amount of pockets. And of course it looks much cooler then your average luggage. Love it. I want to buy the smaller one and have the complete set.
B00171UG4G|5|I BOUGHT A GM PART FOR 1/2 THE PRICE OF AN AFTER MARKET AT AN AUTOPART STORE.  THE PART WAS ORDERED ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND RECEIVED THAT SATURDAY MORNING. THR FUEL PUMP WAS THE CORRECT PART THAT I NEEDED WORKS PERFECTLY. I WILL CONTINUE SHOP ON AMAZON IN THE FUTURE.  I'M VERY HAPPY THAT I DID....
B002BS5VYY|1|Sizes to small. Sub quality
B00AK00UZ0|5|Just installed! Fit great make sure you get proper tool to remove the top nut
B000QIXBIO|5|These are amazing! Perfect fit and easy to maintain. Definitely worth the purchase.
B00HJEGQQ2|3|I needed brighter bulbs as my bike is red and the tail light and brake lights were not bright enough during day light hrs. they blended in with the red on my bike. They seem brighter than oem bulbs but I had to file the contact points and around the radios of the bulb so they would fit in the socket. time will tell for longevity. I haven't had anyone ride behind me yet to confirm if brightness is better that b-4 but they should be.
B004HDY90I|5|Worked great, exact fit.
B008G35YJA|5|Makes the 2001 sequoia look brand new!!
B00EWIS2R4|1|I was not happy with this item
B0012PJXZK|3|MADE BY GABRIEL
B000P6UT1Y|5|Grear tool!!!
B0010E00T6|5|Another Great product from Fram no more smell and pollen to breath. 21/2 years old Pilot needed a simple and easy maintenance for all Honda Pilot owners check your filter go to YouTube for install guide.
B00EP1R7BK|5|Can't get enough of those Vols! Especially if you live in Georgia. Plate arrived in perfect condition, super fast shipping and the price was right too. No problems from this Big Orange Fan!!!! Now if we could just beat Georgia!!!! 🏈🏈☝🏼☝🏼👏🏼

B00CMBY4XY|1|Club CL506 worked fine for two uses until I closed it all the way for storage and it locked in place and cannot be reopened.

B002PQU5IY|5|exellent
B00ECKI4WA|5|Best hand cleaner ever. I purchased this after using another walnut shell based hand cleaner at work (Shell Shocked Supreme from a company in NY, but I couldn't find it to buy). I work in a male dominated industry as a mechanic. I hate hate HATE wearing gloves so I am always dirty with black grease. Greasy, grimy and kinda gross. I also hate the pasty hand cleaners like GoJo  and Goop. They are slimy and leave my hands dried out and feeling scummy. I love this Viva Green stuff. It used to take me a good 8 to 10 minutes to wash my hands and forearms with other hand cleaners, soap, nail brush and washcloth. I use about a quarter coin size of Viva and rub it in well, adding a little water as I go and it rinses clean. CLEAN I tell you! With one washing! I do follow up with a nail brush and liquid dial hand soap to get my fingernails clean. The whole process takes about 3 minutes now and I'm not red and raw from scrubbing. The Viva is moisturizing too... yay, bonus! It has a light scent, I find it pleasant though I can't pinpoint what it smells like exactly. Try it, you won't be disappointed. THIS woman is a customer for life!
B00CPJTJDI|4|Good price
B00TEC93KI|5|put it on my phone..love it
B00K4HBFRQ|3|Lasted a couple months before coating came off.
B00J4PLLNW|5|Look and work great
B003EOXI76|5|Worked perfect on my 91...
B00MB0EX46|5|Great looking but has only two screws to attach to the plate and car.  The upper two only
B00BUS3AKS|5|Great addition to our Subaru Forester.... Makes us feel more secure when placing items in the rear compartment.
B00863M98Y|5|Fit like a glove!
B00PV5CN22|1|Do not stick to the carpet l wanted the same floor mats I ordered the 1st time these mats slide and are not safe
B002LLE1ME|5|Was a piece of junk waited four days then had to update shipping to next day at a cost of $25.00 to get item shipped, then it worked for one week, went to gulf state park for four days and came home and controller quit working just like the last one. will use toggle switch to control steps from now on.
B00IW5EIQ2|5|Transmission was priced reasonable and shipped in reasonable time.
B007Y54456|5|We love these shades.  Have them for all the cars.
B000GU25XE|5|Great sounding muffler. I put these on my CB350 as the stock units were rusted empty. Gives the bike a nice mellow throaty sound.  Not poppy and raspy as other units seem to be.  Chrome is very good.  It will take just a bit of modifying to mount it to the original exhaust mounting locations.
B0060A8TNY|5|Solid quality.
B007V2CQ9S|5|This is a quality sunshade, and it fits perfectly in the windshield. It has a substantial feel to it, not like those floppy sunshades sold at the stores. Keeps the vehicles noticeably cooler and doesn't allow any sunlight to pass through the windshield. This keeps the dash cool and protects the plastic surfaces and the leather seats inside. I use mine daily.  It folds up nearly into itself like an accordion. It also looks like a custom product from Chevy.
B00C250JQG|3|Great looking product but runs a little small
B00SQ2GEJA|1|I bought one a year ago for $1,000.00 , and was charged $500.00 to install. The second one I've had, the first came with my trailer and lasted 4 months. I am a handicapped senior on S.S. so I  can't remove the unit myself  to send it back for repairs and just went through a summer of 100* + in Calaveras, County, Ca. I'm very upset and unable to contact Dometic directly but I don't expect a satisfactory reply or compensation for my trouble. I suspect that the units were made in China. If you folks at Dometic read this, please contact me via  Amazon if possible  Now I'm looking for a viable replacement.preferably another brand but the swap will most likely cause more headaches and cost me  more  money.<br /><br />ive had really stand by their e in less than a year. It  lasted about 4 months before tripping the breaker, now  I'm looking for a viable replacement,  I've gone through a summer of 100*+ in Calaveras County,  Ca. without an a/c and I'm very upset since I am a handicapped senior on S.S. and can't do the work to remove it or pay someone to do it for me  to send it back for warranty work. I probably would never buy one again unless I could be compensated for my time and trouble by Dometic --fat chance of that! I would love to see companies stand behind their products, but suspect that it was made in China.If you folks at Dometic read this, please contact me

B00802FHH6|5|excellent product from an excellent buyer
B00430CBSW|5|A little rough on the teeth, but it makes removing wax residue from door channels a breeze!
B0011T45GE|4|Worked as it should good product

B00374RAFY|5|Love these mats!!! Just got them a couple days ago and they look perfect in my expedition. Bought another set for my parents because they like them too
B0079KRFAW|5|First time trying  , don't know yet
B00KMUY0D6|5|great price
B000F20NT6|5|These fit the 6-speed MT 2004 Acura TSX perfectly. Grommets line up with floor hooks. They don't slip or slide or interfere with clutch pedal. No fitment issues at all. A+
B00C0SQ8KG|4|Very good for the price
B003GCSJAC|4|Took forever to get,  cheap and shipping was free. I wish the tip was slightly more pointed and the grooves more ergonomic. For what it cost it'll do the trick.
B000AMAE36|3|These lights are very good.
B00ECDCH7U|5|It is what it says, good quality genuine copper (which is getting more rare) so no power lost if your power source is marginal
B006S644ZW|5|Fit perfect and looks real cool
B001DKQNUC|5|Great
B000AMBNPY|1|Not very effective and more of a pain to deal.  Used them a few times, then tossed.
B000GZPCYI|5|Good quality product and easy to use. Works as described.
B00HKSMSQ4|5|Amazing product! Fantastic prize, the gloves were XL but they fit me good. I usually wear medium or sometimes even small
B00ZE9BKBA|1|This item is a P.O.S.!  First of all it leaks. And yes I made sure the washer was in place. The threads on the soap container are so shallow it  can't seat properly.  Then it goes through the soap so fast that you can't even do the first quarter panel without the soap running out.  I had my son scrub while I sprayed soap on the car and I still wasn't fast enough. As for quality,  it seems fairly nice in your hand all up until the time you start to use it then you see how cheap it is. I was going to  use it to wash my house also but it  isn't suited for that task either.  Lesson learned, by American... If you can find it.  Either way, don't buy this.
B009I2G89I|5|Awesome!
B00UXXJHTO|3|the fit is perfect but the white wears off in about a month
B00HVHVTH8|5|Wife loves it!  So much she takes her keys to bed now... I'm sleeping on the couch...
B000BZZQXA|5|Great rear rotors for the MKIV so far.  Especially for the price.
B000BPZ306|5|This is one of the coolest items I've ever purchased from Amazon. It worked beautifully soaking up an incursion of water from the water supply pipe that cracked coming into our basement. It took a while for the plumbers to arrive...the Absorber sopped up gallons of leaky water. It was almost fun wringing the Absorbers!
B00JK94XY6|5|serious supplier, recommended
B00JWSCSY2|3|Doesn't fit the bar it gets grouped with as well as it's a pain to install and has leaked twice. I would suggest not buying this one. I had a professional install it and it still leaks. Taking it back for my 2nd time to re-seal it. Over all consensus is to buy a roof rack and mount it to that.
B00475I4RK|5|This was awesome
B005JU5UEW|5|The BEST blades I have ever used.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|I have a 2011 Honda Accord Coupe and it fits perfectly. My car is black with a black leather interior so even in Pennsylvania the summer sun makes EVERY surface hot enough to burn your skin. The shade makes a significant difference in temperature, enough to no longer burn me. It installs in seconds and stays up just fine. It doesn't come with instructions, but the company actually emailed me to see how I liked the shade. I asked them for folding instructions and got several detailed paragraphs. I tried it,and although a bit cumbersome, it took maybe 90 seconds. Chances are however, nobody is going to fold it back into its very small storage bag on a daily basis anyway. It easily folds in half and stores perfectly right behind my passenger seat.
B0099WQOY6|2|The Side no is the adecuade for my.
B0009V1WS4|5|Great & worked well
B007KCYKHA|5|Nice fit, looks real pretty. Has the built in window washer spout. Replaces the old faded and cracked one. Happy happy.
B00H3TLBM2|5|Fan/AC/Heat (blower) was working intermittently in my 2002 Qx4.  Replaced Blower assembly and that did not fix the problem.  Ordered this at 7PM and paid $4 for overnight shipping.  It was at my door less than 12 hours later.  Installed part and A/C and Heat work perfectly now.
B00EYBHH02|5|Worked perfectly
B001763SRI|5|These Tom Tom Adhesive Disks met my expectations perfectly.
B000ZBHTAI|5|Slap it on.<br />Rub it in.<br />Wipe it off.<br /><br />This is a new car wax, a show car wax, not a quick wax.<br /><br />Simply put, this is top of the line wax and it won't disappoint. Just make sure you have flawless paint and clear coat. At the least clay before applying.<br /><br />If your clear coat is thin or your paint is swirly or hologramming, the wax will make the imperfections in your paint and clear coat stand out even more.
B00QXE76H2|5|Worked great easy to instal
B000FA91DC|5|Fit perfectly to replace the old one
B0048DXGVK|5|I'm delighted to have original looking floor matts.  These were what I had hoped for.  If the color is only slightly darker than the ones before, it doesn't matter and isn't obvious. I'm so glad to have made this purchase.
B00KONM33A|4|Fits a little  loose , good  quality  rubber.
B00BP5NQG4|5|Perfect
B00L2E2SOY|4|It fits perfectly with my car. Thanks.
B00SJTREE4|4|The pipes look great and very easy to install. Sound is good but would like it to be a little louder. It is a good comprise, neighbors should be happy, it sounds good when you twist the grip. Should improve as it burns out.
B00876OHF8|5|Perfect fit. Excellent product.
B00HCQA7BC|5|Very nice product and easy to install!
B000JFJLTC|5|Great tool works well
B001TLC12E|5|Great product
B001DYUKRK|5|Great item and super fast shipping. Very happy.
B00CGGXQV6|5|My second truxport and 5th truxedo brand cover they are simply the best my last one is 5 years old and still going strong
B005CLMYOW|4|Fit right up-so far-so good
B0009JKGKG|5|I've been using it in my 2004 Dodge Dakota for some time and have noticed that the engine idles smoother, mileage is about the same though<br /><br />I have 162,000 miles on it and it runs as good as new, if not better. I also use use it for my lawn mower and snow blower. Great Stuff.......
B00B7SJIC0|5|It worked perfectly
B00HWIZO6I|3|When I first used this product, I panicked because it turned the leather quite dark.  It did lighten within 24 hours, however within a couple of weeks it was back to the original condition of the leather that needed treatment/conditioning.  Did not condition the leather for very long, unfortunately.
B00GE9Y5IE|5|Very nice mud flaps.  Easy install on the front but took a little time on the rear ones.
B007KCXI0U|5|I bought one about a year ago. It's a perfect match in my opinion. Simple to install. I smashed it into a fence so I'm buying another. It's a good product at a fair price.
B010W2NSWC|5|Bought a 2013 r1 which came with an unkown hid kit with 10k bulbs on, which looked awesome but didnt light up the road at all. I ordered 5k bulbs, which arrived promtly, worked perfectly and do a much better job and the high beams look sharp and come on quickly as well. Very happy with the product and it is a very affordable replacement bulbs.
B00Z4VUKDM|5|Very good case. I just started using it but so far so good.
B004QMB07K|5|Thank you very much this product is worth the money
B00KRQWX7K|5|Just as described!  This looks great on my dark windows.  They threw in a 9-11 sticker that looks great with it!
B00EAPKFE2|5|Love it! Very satisfied!
B00ACFOCHU|5|Excellent 100%
B00NJFUV3O|5|Great buy
B00KTIHU0G|5|Awesome decal!
B004YTTM3Y|1|This is false advertisement, in the pic it looks like the colors are solid and bumpy. What i got was a piece of crap that is painted different colors than are displayed on the pic and rusty mounting hardware. Its a sham don't bother wasting your money. No stars for this product if anything its negative -5 Stars. I had to give it a star to post.
B000C2CLU8|5|exelente
B00EHIWRCK|5|very well pleased
B00EC0Z68U|5|works great
B005MHPWGI|5|These gloves fit perfectly and are very comfortable.
B00HLAGLLE|5|Exact fit for my '06 wrangler. Shipped fast and fixed my issue.
B00BDOCWMQ|5|Ive tried pretty much every kind of wheel cleaner from every brand.  This by far is the best and safest wheel cleaner.  The only bad part is the price.  It is super expensive compare to the good old soap and hand washing the wheel. I dont use this product every wash. I only use it for deep cleaning the brake dust off my Evo X wheels. After hard track day my white wheels are covered in dark brake dust. Sonax wheel cleaner can get 95% off just by spraying and rinsing ! you still have to use a wash mitt to get the 5% off<br /><br />Other products will get 60-70% of my brake dust off from spraying and rinsing.
B00ELHT5JA|5|Great trans fluid, smoother shifts, smoother acelleration, fixed hard shifts, and it increased my mpg by 2 (every mile counts)
B01237AQSS|4|I've recently spent much more on a heavy duty hammock like this one. The price was right and so far I can't see any difference.
B000BRFQLK|5|Very good product.
B00PP6CD9A|5|This part was exactly as described and a perfect match to the OEM part.
B004ZZVP2I|5|Easy mod and felt the difference on a 2011 WRX
B0031HWSIG|5|Cheaper than the local auto chain parts store. Perfect fit. No qualms.
B00KPWBBLA|5|Easy install even a girl can do it. Love the product. Would definitely purchase from seller again.
B00407TVXG|5|It's a perfect match to the factory paint. Never thought I would give 5 &#34;love it&#34;stars to a can of paint.
B001KXIHFG|5|Love it!
B00F8LEB9W|1|Great looking but don't work!  For me they would pretty much only work if you're in your vehicle (and that doesn't do you any good does it). More than a foot away and they don't work. My friends laugh at me when I literally have to be right next to the vehicle to get them (I bought 2 pack) to work and even that sometimes takes 5/6 tries. Very Disappointed!
B0027OSKC2|4|Looks good on my H2
B00ABYVT64|1|All of them stopped working within 5 months. I don't even understand how they could have broke. I just had a water vinegar solution in it and only used it once a week.
B001AJMOLS|5|perfect fit and are easy to install and remove.  Look like original equipment.
B00QEV0ZBI|5|nice
B00032KC3K|3|This item is cheaper and smaller than the normal screw caps, and the color does not look dark enough black.  I kept it anyways because its too much trouble to return
B002Z32OHW|3|I purchase this Unit to read and calibrate the RPM from a GX390 and GX200 Honda engine i have, Really I could not get a reliable reading, it was jumping all over at idle and at MAX (+/- 3600 RPM) the reading was crazy so the unit in my opinion was no good at all. I was geting ready to return the unit.<br /><br />Then reading the review I found a Review from Mr. Pelesl, He say in his review that He open the unit and solder a jumper on the board so the Antenna is connected, so I did exactly that , Open the unit found the part where the Jumper was open (or not connected)  and made a Jumper with a little of solder.<br /><br />After that the unit is working great and is very reliable readings , Why they don't have that Jumper I really don't know, But I suggest that You do the same.<br /><br />Hope this help
B000BNU54M|5|bumper fit great. had to use my existing brackets. The snap on plastic cover clips are delicate so when you snap it in make sure they are aligned. Looks great. Shipping was fast and good customer service
B00YI3IGA6|5|I love my new ShadeSox.  Now my fur baby doesn't have to sit in the sun.  I will say that I have to be extra careful when checking my blind spots as these are pretty dark.  But I still love them.
B000WEMJRQ|5|This is just what I needed and fits perfect!
B00J06M77Y|4|This is a very light ladder.  I bought it for the grand kids to be able to climb back on the pontoon in deep water.  Although it is rated at 300 pounds it is, in my opinion, too light to be used by heavier adults. For the price of 100 dollars it was ok.  I'm curious how I'll replace the rubber latch that holds the ladder in place while the boat is under way.
B001BS9VR8|5|Was delivered promptly and after installation the rough idle and hesitation vanished. YouTube videos helped with some tricks.
B00VK0ATNC|4|Showed up at my door earlier than posted and quality items. Would give 5 star if when shipped lights were marked what colors each one is. Half red half amber.
B0042VTYSW|5|Hopefully it will work very well if I would ever need to use it.
B001UHQXQ2|5|Excellent value. Use for claying and as instant detailer at  Upholstery shop. I was buying what ever was on sale at the local auto shop average cost $7.00 a bottle 16oz.<br />Works great!
B000EDOSN8|5|great
B005JCQ7V0|4|Very Happy with these tie downs.  However, I opted to upgrade the screws and took one of the screws and matched it up with one as similar as possible with stainless steel.  The screws that come with the cleats is a self-drilling design.  So I had to predrill the holes with the SS screws.  Also I used a polyurethane caulk to bed the cleat as I attached them to my truck bed.  Somewhat messy but really will extend the chance for rust to get started on my truck bed from drilling the holes.
B00C0SQ8KG|4|So far... so good.... super bright!
B00LWGRBGC|5|Great purchase.  The product, supplier and shipping were all great.  Thanks,
B00N20Z5H8|5|Very helpful tools
B000VU57YS|5|great fit but would be nice if it included tailgate mat.
B00513G82U|5|Can't beat it for the price, had to engineer a mounting system in order to utilize my saddlebags. Have it on a hinge and locks with a seat pin setup. Works great, very functional!
B004K9ETMM|5|great grips, look great on my bike, i got the black one !!!
B005G9CN3C|5|Have purchased similar products in the past and am very impressed with the clear lighting and durability of this interior lights.  The kit came with a few extra lights that may be for the license plate.  The only drawback is there are limited or no instructions, otherwise these are well made, low priced lights, that exceed expectations, produced what is promised.  I would and have recommended these lights made by Classy Auto or Auto Goody.  None have failed or burnt out in five vehicles I've installed into.
B008O9DV78|5|Fantastic operation!! REALLY cleans the tank out!
B00M9LY7OI|5|Looks like a great improved design with the O-ring seals. Giving these a try for the first time & hoping for longer lasting bearings.
B00GSAUHB8|5|This product is exactly what we hoped for. Simple, easy to use, effective, and affordable. No deception here. If you need a sun shade, this is the one.&#34;
B003S1RQ2S|5|Seems to be working just fine in my security system.
B001UOYNK8|5|Love this!! Removed all odor from my vehicle. It had been smoked in previously.
B001KVW6EQ|5|Loved it, works great. Not a second glance from anyone. So nice not to have to ask for one, flights are much less stressful.
B00KRO0UO0|5|Just as described works  perfect I would recommend this product to family and friends
B00SG1G9MI|5|I have ordered these several times for 3 different cars. They last for quiet a long time before having to be replaced. They really protect your factory key fob too!  I love all the different colors. I do hope they come out with even more colors:). This is the only company that I can find with a good selection.
B00GSAUHB8|4|just right for my Prius.
B00KSZ5F5C|2|I work in a graphics and vinyl shop, which we primarily use 3M vinyl for vehicle wraps, so when I purchased this, I was a little worried about quality, and for good reason. First of all, I have no complaints about the look, or feel of the product, it's rather good! But my issue was the adhesion. I bought this to wrap a few different things, some interior panels, as well as exterior parts of different cars. This is where I started having issues, the vinyl stretches pretty well with heat, but I found that it just didn't adhere well at all! I cleaned all my surfaces thoroughly, like I normally do when installing customer wraps, but it just did not want to stay down. I thought it could be just having issues on a painted surface of the car, so I then began to wrap the interior parts, which are not painted, but are some form of plastic. Again, I cleaned and prepped the pieces, applied the vinyl, and for the night, it was perfect. Next morning, it was lifting in all the curves and edges where it had been trimmed, and was basically just not sticking.<br /><br />I could be doing something egregiously wrong, but after 3 years of installing vinyl on all sorts of cars, planes, and other random objects, I feel like I knew what I was doing, but was just let down by some poor adhesive properties of the vinyl.<br /><br />Luckily, it was inexpensive, and all I was really out of was some hours of my time, but just a word to the wise: cheap is cheap.
B00D9C2CDO|4|I bought this assured I had 4 sides of racks on my SUV.  When I went to put it on I realized that the side racks were flush with the roof.  No worries, though.  We packed the heaviest and biggest item in the front, and secured all 8 ties to the front and back racks.  No problems at all, and it rained the whole trip and no leaking.  Very pleased with the performance of this product considering it is much cheaper than the other options out there.
B002KHJCF0|5|They fit perfectly and so far there is no rub off on my heels.  They also have no lingering odor.
B001H1I40O|4|Good product
B0017ODSAW|5|Very bright. I had to replace all my bulbs because it looked funny with this one being brighter than the rest.
B0048J1M6A|5|perfect part and fit properly.awesome.
B00AUFMGBG|1|My experience is the same as other reviewer. The front deflectors were installed and i love it, but the rear ones do not adhere and keep sliding down, which i believe is due to tha small gap in the rear glass and the double sided tape came off even before the install. I highly recommend getting only the front deflector package which is also listed and available on Amazon.. Wearhertech knows rhe issues and its still in the market. They should have modify it to address the said issue.
B00JNZRTD4|1|Waist of money no pattern and doesn't put out enough paint with tip backed all the way out maybe a primer gun but not for sealer or base for small jobs only
B011Q18D14|2|who is OxGord? all i got was an old fashioned Autel MS300. no instruction book. no code book. no CD. no battery to remember the codes. no code descriptions. I DON'T LIKE PAID REVIEWS.
B001A049SI|5|Fit my sonata and less expensive than dealership.
B000BYB8EC|5|Arrived fast and as described.
B00EZYLIM6|5|LED is awesome.  Last light melted plastic as it was too hot.  LED stays cool and the light is bright.
B006LIYLL4|5|They look awesome. Put them in my fog lights on my 03 cummins. Really sets it off
B001TJZ6IC|4|The seat covers are great except for the back seat cover piece. It was not as easy to connect near the head rests.
B004XJ0EF0|5|I have found that you can never have to many of these.  We are always loosing them if we switch seat to another vehicle.
B009LLUVHG|5|Very,Very good
B00CUOLQUC|5|Easy to install.
B005C5A8VE|5|worked great on a 660 Grizzly made lot quieter
B00I8TZ0O6|5|Good quality but makes a difficult install. No tabs on the outsides of the pieces to be able to grab the pieces and adjust them. Other than that though good quality.
B004CMMFK0|5|Great Product. Very Nice!
B0097A9PDC|5|Great design and well made. Should be OEM in every vehicle...
B000CPCBEQ|5|So far so good. I had to buy 4 for my standard Transmission
B00II8HHP2|4|The chrome covers fit just right.<br /> Make sure to pre-fit.<br />I would recommend .
B000B66NVS|5|more than met my standards, very easy to use
B00Q3CL4EA|5|I've been a Superman fan since childhood and I couldn't let $18.90 pass for this awesome seat covers.  Fits my 2006 Toyota Tacoma perfectly!
B00O83I5AW|5|Fast shipping and great product!
B00LNN3MRQ|5|Easy to install. Improved the trigger pull on my gun. Recomended!
B00VWKKCAA|5|Looks great on my fiances hard hat.
B00THH9GQG|5|The seller was so nice. They gave me a credit because they didn't get to my order quickly enough. It was very thoughtful and I am really enjoying the decal. It's good quality vinyl so it should last a while. THANK YOU!!!!
B00CPKV8JU|5|The wife loves it!!
B00P3SM34K|1|Handle broke on 2nd trip to the dump station and the wheel covers came off..!!  I would have returned it if I could have, but it was passed the 90 days...  whatever...  We have a small Thetford Tote and it works great so we thought the company would back their product... Wrong..  This is a total waste of money.  It is not constructed to hold the heavy load.
B007NMETW8|5|Perfect match.
B0073ME4P0|1|Stated it would fit my 68 corvette but filler neck and hose placement was way off
B007JZ9MU8|2|Corroded and pitted quickly, even with heavy waxing.  Had to replace with stainless steel.  Extremely disappointed.
B005J6JRMM|4|We had to return it because the receiving part is too narrow for our seat belt &#34;prong.&#34;  The male end fit perfectly and appeared to &#34;catch&#34; well, but we didn't do our homework and check by vehicle model.<br /><br />We want them for the back seat of a 2008 Infiniti FX35, because the grandkids can't buckle by themselves; the receiver is buried in the seat fold.<br /><br />Disappointed that we had to return!
B007OTH02G|5|love it
B00CUN77XS|2|Too large for my 2015 honda accord key. No hole to put the actual key in, had to make one. Did not fit at all. Expected it to fit snug on the key.
B00V9T0HZ4|5|Got this truck rack for my Tundra and it's great.  I had no issues with the packaging and everything was perfect out of the box.  Assembly was very easy and the system looks great on my black truck.  I've purchased a few things from ROLA and the value for the price is very good. Highly recommend this product!
B000BRV5XS|5|Using this as my go to everyday lube for firearms. Fully synthetic so it does not break down or degrade. 50W so it stays put much better and seems to last longer that a 10-30 or other motor oils. Not sure about it's rust inhibitors so for longer term storage I stick with Balistol but the firearms I use regularly I am pleased.
B00NJ9MZH0|5|Bright lights harley passing lamps
B001OM8ED8|5|looks great on my blacked out 05 navigator
B010APNNAS|5|Good to fill up your motorcycle tire. Do not recommend leaving it on or else you would through off the balance of your tire.<br />These could be left on huge mudder or truck tires without that effect.  Much more reasonably priced vs alternatives here on Amazon.
B000E24APU|5|for a low traffic area, this product worked perfectly. I dont imagine it would be a permanent solution for a seating area. Fortunately, I just had a to fix a corner of a leather ottoman that my dog chewed....it worked great.
B0013RIOSE|1|The casting is terrible. 4 of the bolt holes have no sealing surface around the inside edge and everything I have tried won't seal the cover. It is very heavy and very strong but is worthless if it won't seal. Through my own fault I missed the return or exchange window so I'm stuck with it, my recommendation is to thoroughly inspect the item when it arrives.  Update: I ended up welding more material around the holes that had little or no sealing surface and fixed the problem.
B000VKT08M|5|very nice
B000C2G5ZA|5|Great to have in the toolbox when you suddenly need a new gasket and don't want to order a whole new set. Need a very sharp tool or punch to cut without tearing. Used for intake/carb gaskets
B00MG687JW|5|I want to say that I did a lot of research before I bought this product and I bought it because of its capacity not just because of the amount of jumpstart amperage it has. Even though it has more than  most. The capacity turned out to be all that it said it would be an even more. I jumpstarted my six-cylinder Buick six times without a single recharge to the battery . Then went on to start my old tractor four-cylinder diesel tractor and it turned over very nicely. I would recommend it to anyone who has a bigger engine because of it can start my six cylinder Buick then go on to crank my 40-year-old tractor over a half dozen times it proved itself to me..
B00E1ETJNU|1|Don't buy will ruin your car, caused bad rust and scratched my car .. See picture I've attached
B00EPA7CZC|1|Lasted about 3 months. Water in lamp. Drove the vehicle in one rain storm and bam ! Water in the lamp.
B000Z0HVHA|3|Works as advertised
B001GEKASQ|3|Great product, great fit and good quality. The only problem I had is the antenna hole which you have to cut yourself. They provide a grommet that is meant for 1/4 inch thick material, not the thin material of the cover.  I removed my antenna, installed the cover, marked the position and cut the hole as directed. I installed the grommet which was worthless as it did not clamp up on the fabric. Then I installed the cover over the antenna first as suggested. When I pulled the cover over the mirror, the cover ripped wide open at the antenna.  If you have an antenna but want to use this cover, I would recommend just removing the antenna and everything will be just fine.
B007GREP2Y|5|Great product, looks really good and extends riding time.  great service and fast delivery. Awesome guys
B006QMIKIK|5|without this i probably would not have liked my car. friend helped me install after we viewed a you-tube video. Completed without hassle and arms have thanked me since.
B000BUTDCA|5|This was perfect for our needs. The handles seemed superfluous when I was ordering, but they really make this easier to hook-up and UN-hook. We just bought our RV this spring, and we have purchased most of our items from Amazon for it, and have yet to be disappointed.
B0006IX87S|3|doesn't seem to really be a microbial type of thing which is more what I wanted to be sure of, some of these campgrounds wells are over some pretty sketchy looking farmland , who knows what has been in that soil for years !!!!
B00QXE76H2|1|Until they fix this issue they are getting a bad review. This thing is a pile of crap!!! Cables keep coming off, motor sounds like a blender full off rocks( I'm sure cables are binding up inside), was shipped with a broken piece..... A 50$ pile of dog sh!t. I will change my opinion if they send a better one FAST!
B004084DBU|4|Looks well made. For the money you would think you would get a tool box decal.
B000C9N24U|5|Fits perfectly. So far, no complaints
B00ZS9S1LS|5|Nice
B00LNOVMG8|5|Amazing Product. Bought it for my 2007 Ford F150 XLT 6.5 Foot Bed. It makes it look brand new. It's very easy to install in warmer weather and fits great. The shipping was right on time and it was an amazing price compared to others
B007ZGBLNW|1|water gets under the lens, not sealed very well but its bright
B0007IKG1I|4|Cheap, but useful if you rarely use them.
B002U729UA|5|Only stuff that goes on my Black HARLEY for the last 14 years
B001JT98W2|5|Keeps track of his paperwork, and easily kept for any emergencies.
B001E4E0ZW|1|This came with all of the hardware except the pieces to secure the license plate to the bracket.
B003CJORQE|5|great
B00DCCWFP6|5|All good :)
B000BYGD2O|5|Worked great in my truck.
B001AIZ5HY|5|Good value.  Don't know if husband has used it yet.
B00PZUQCAC|5|works exactly as i wanted too  two thumbs up!!!
B00KGIDFNU|5|Purcased this to replace the starter on a 5.0 mercruiser.  Fit perfect and the moter cranked right up.  Excellent price
B001O0GHCA|5|Nice feel, shape and solid color. Fits my 2011 maxima. Does what it say it does. No one is breaking these off!
B003G0KO6G|4|good fit
B0027UPPK6|5|I'm still using this product after a year. I'm using it for my tilt and trim on the back of my boat. So its get used a lot.
B005V9OR40|4|Easy to install. I had to shim they crew clips a little with washers and then the screws in the kit were to short, so that sent me hunting for screws that would work. Good update for an older truck.
B003VGL20W|3|I was kinda pleased. I received the shipment in  two parts and they are slightly different in color.
B007VWYEF2|4|Great price ..hydraulic fluid is hydraulic fluid. delivered quickly and price was terrific.
B00HZCNL1Q|5|Looks cool on my rifle case. Sticks well.
B001O77CMW|4|The Bestem T-Box appears to be robust and well made. The travel trunk detaches from the base plate using one key that also opens the trunk. The trunk has a built in handle that allows you to carry it in one hand like a suitcase. However, my biggest disappointment is that it will not hold two full face motorcycle helmets. It probably will hold two open face helmets, but definitely not my two full face helmets. Also,I installed this trunk on Honda CB1100 luggage rack. The supplied universal mounts did not work on this particular luggage carrier, so I had to re-drill the base plate and purchase new screws to attach the same to the Honda brand luggage carrier. Although this was a minor inconvenience, its a much tidier and better looking way of installing the base plate. Finally, I consider this motorcycle trunk to provide good value for the price paid.
B00HDBV634|5|Pretty awesome wheel covers ! Made my old car look more modern . Came when expected, very satisfied.
B00MB2I7YQ|5|Came early, exactly as I wanted. Was true to the picture. Stuck it right on the car. :)
B005EY2X16|5|Works perfectly
B00OFPWP54|3|The one I brought only change 2 color,green and red no yellow ! They still look nice.
B00NOAJK1S|5|Great item.  Extremely bright and easy to install.  Highly recommended.
B00ZRJCYQ2|4|I haven't used them yet, but the look and feel sufficient to do the job.
B00CF721SK|5|The price is outstanding!  The rotors are a perfect fit,  and so much better than OEM!!! These rotors and pads are of excellent quality. I'm very picky and want the best product for my money.  So thankful for find these on Amazon.  I would buy these again in a heartbeat!
B0070NFGMC|1|It worked twice. That's it. Twice. It is cheaply made and I wouldn't waste my time with it.
B00KTIVX68|1|Works as advertised, easily programed.  Update  8-28-15 As easily as these two remotes were to program, the buttons just as easily wore out. They still click but nothing works, changed battery still nothing, opened them up to check the hardware, and there visually fine but inoperable.
B00HSKTKW4|5|Excellent fit.
B0016NBBQW|5|cleared my P0420 dtc code on my 2002 toy 4runner after installation.  saved me a lot of money for DIY since dealer and independent mechanics wanted new catalytic converter installed for $1000 - $2000.
B00I796HS0|2|It is tiny.  About 2 3/8&#34; long and 2 3/8&#34; diameter.  Smallest Subaru oil filter I've ever seen, and I've owned and changed filters on 5 Subarus since 1975.  Probably the first oil filter I've seen from anyone without a rubber gasket.  At least it was cheap.  Hope my engine doesn't revolt.
B00URUIKAK|5|Amazing product for price. Real value. When searching online could find enough pics so took some of my own. Used layers on inner and outer skin of doors. Put liner over and works great
B0007TV6M0|5|So easy to use and great for leaving in the trunk for the drive in car wash do-it-yourself places. I have a towel and a few of these in my car so when I go to the car wash my car always gets a wax. It is quick and easy after the car is dried. I use it on my jey skis and boat too!
B0073AMBLQ|5|perfect fit for a 2014 toyota sienna
B00BSCFETQ|5|absolutely fantastic
B0073AMK62|5|perfect fit for a 2014 toyota sienna eight seater
B00M8M5LWK|5|This looks so cool! It came very fast too!
B0149STDXS|5|This is vital for any handyman. If you have misplaced your regular tool, you can't go wrong with having this spare kit as a reserve to get your DIY done.
B0001MQ7EK|5|I love this product. I recently took a 3-week trip out west while temps were in 90's every day. I bought 6-packs of water and kept them in the cooler which I kept on the floor behind the passenger seat. I would stop at a rest area and pull out a cold bottle of water instead of paying a dollar or more at a vending machine.
B009F4JHHO|5|Car diagnostic OK.
B00YBGAU2W|5|The tray was a perfect fit. I am so glad I ordered it!!
B009LOO1DS|5|good replacement
B0025B4EQ8|5|Worked perfectly on my 2005 Mercedes E320 CDI
B00YC04DZW|5|It works
B0042J8EN0|5|The sideskirt was falling off my 300 Limited. Arrived very quickly.  Just what I needed!  Skirt panels are now secure.
B00IEYDSHQ|5|Exact fit! They look great and it feels great knowing I have new tread and wheels without rust to run on again.
B001T8J4YK|2|I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  He had been wanting this for his F250 to see if he could get better gas mileage.  This didn't seem to have any effect on the gas mileage but he does like the driving coach.
B00LEBLI82|5|Saves the plastic light covers from getting brittle over time due to heat from incandescent bulbs.<br />Great LED replacents. Decent price. Bright white light. Uses only a fraction of the wattage the original lights used.
B00A9UXOJ0|5|none
B00NO0QZMU|5|Keep things just as they rolled out of the Honda factory with this oil.  As the bottle says, motorcycles are more demanding than cars - make sure you use gn4, and you won't have a problem.  Used this in my classic CT70, and my Honda Grom, both of which rev high and work hard.
B000C9DPZ6|5|perfect work well.
B00VFFRY8U|5|It's a great sticker, I wish it was a tad smaller, maybe 2/3 its current size but I knew the dimensions when I bought it. Clean cut, applied well and hasn't started peeling at all. Awesome looking vinyl decal. Love the ME series and this is a cool way to show it. It also helps me easily pick my car out in the parking lot.
B001UCGE4S|5|Sealed good
B007EA6QMA|5|Awkward to get some bikes on but my hubs made it work.
B003VASL8E|4|This is just Vinyl glue.  I was hoping for something that actually filled in a worn spot.  It does certainly work to repair a torn area, and will bond the pieces together.
B003VMU180|5|Love it
B004AJA9M6|5|Looks great on my 2009 Tacoma TRD 4WD. If your not machanically inclined ask a friend or a professional that is. Not hard to do.I did install mine by myself with a bad back. But I know how to get around when I do not have those extra hands.The winch holder is ware you my need a machically inclined individual.It needs to go on first before the grill gaurd.Radiator needs to be disconnected from its holders to add supports to make an easier install.Patients!!!!!!!!!!! Read the directions not that bad.Slow and easy.Make it fun.
B00377QYLC|5|These work perfect! I used them to put new stereos in my daughters' cars (1997 Volvo 960 and 2000 Volvo V70).  I was able to do all my splicing sitting comfortably at the table, then went outside, plugged them in, and - perfect!  Great product!
B00UIUPH2S|5|The lights are just as described, bright and amber as depicted in the photos.  Very good customer service and quick to respond!  installation is straight forward and simple.  The wire harness is not complicated and is literally Plug & Play.
B007OX6E3S|5|I originally purchased the Innolife adaptor.  It was very poor quality.  Thea adapters are a much better item and work great.
B0083IAO5M|5|i have several of these and have given them as gifts, they are a blessing when you have a flat
B00KZD8KT0|5|The item arrived on time and as described. Really easy to install... took about 5 minutes for both. They look really cool. Everybody who gets in my Mini comments on them. The seller reached out to me a couple weeks later to check if the item arrived, see if I was satisfied and even offered a promo code discount to buy another set for my back doors, which I did. Great customer service to compliment a great product.
B00NVUHJSM|5|very nice
B0000WS5VY|5|none
B00B9DEDNC|5|Cleans without water.  No mess, and cleans effectively.  Also has pleasing scent.
B00EW6LDLI|5|it was pretty easy to apply and looks great on my car!
B00GC3RBTC|3|Really need to make sure you get good glue to hold the side pieces in place, they tend to pull up after a while...
B0087YCMCA|5|What can I say. Good quality brand, and it's an O-Ring chain. It will last an easy 10,000 plus, off road miles.
B000C5UFQ2|5|Fixed the check engine light
B00EPMWP66|5|Solid, heavy rubber.  Good quality.
B00F7GZI68|4|Great product just wish it would have been a bit bigger
B00KHFX84I|5|Very nice!!
B0007IMBIO|5|Great product, did its job.
B00JA2JS2A|5|Arrived fast and as described.
B00P32EQKU|5|Nice..!!
B004A55HCW|5|best price
B0002YP8MO|1|I used an entire can and it hardly covered anything. It was also difficult to spray. I tried Rustolleum after that and one can was more than enough for the coverage I wanted. I couldn't believe how much better it worked! This was a waste of money.
B00FY3WE2K|5|Good quality product.  Fit was very close to original.
B001D9DP0E|1|3 months ago replaced two bulbs on my mazda 6. Couple days ago see no reflection from one of them in the shiny bumper of some other car.
B00EEG8O6S|5|Amazing product. Great fit and look
B009PIKHYW|5|It is great. They for my 2014 Ford Escape perfectly.
B00NHJE5RA|5|Arrive on time plus quality its very good no difference between original and this one.Highly recommend.
B000CK5ISM|4|Raybestos is best. they aren't kidding. Only way you can do better is to find some NOS asbestos brakes.
B00EEGA4IY|2|did not fit
B005DJFXY6|5|These will come in handy when I ride my motorcycle in the rain.
B007YLIK2S|5|Good product, fit very well and recliner is now fixed.
B00BYGMEGC|5|I installed these pegs along with the Kinetic grips on my V-rod Muscle.  I like the looks, and they are almost double the size of the stock units.  They are a great fit for my size 12 boots, and you can adjust the angle for a perfect fit.  One note; once you decide the best angle, it might be a good idea to install blue lock tight when you tighten it down.  There's no vibration going to my feet, and they are big enough to rest on comfortably and not have to search for them when taking off from a stop.
B000TM7HXC|5|Use it all the time... Works great
B001G7OVGA|5|Easy to install. Works perfectly on my Volvo s40
B003554TB8|5|We were able to pack a lot of our vacation gear in the bag, leaving the space in our car for the coolers. Easy to use!
B00EEKMFZA|5|Nice starter solenoid relay thanks I recommend this solenoid for any VL 800 Volusia.
B000S2MP1C|5|Great fit and easy fast install I couldn't be more pleased!
B00IX5MOD0|5|Wow! High quality product! Super breeze installing. Last purchase I made was from a different manufacturer and although it worked, it was the worst build quality ever.<br />I was pleasantly surprised to note the high quality packing and build.<br />Absolutely recommend this product.
B004C444PC|5|Very nice gloves that appear to be of good quality. I will have to see how they hold up before I give my final analysis.
B001G77WRU|5|reserve part
B00SZK1VXC|1|Install was easy. Did one night of driving less than 30 mins the bulb already started flickering and just died!!! i'm currently going through customer support to get a replacement. i will give this H1 OPT 7 another try. and hoping the LED lives up to its sellers description 60k hours plus!!! I will update review after replacement bulbs arrive.
B000B8WCA2|5|Important part of my body work arsenal.  I only use 3M wetordry sandpaper.
B00EPDKXB4|1|Completely dissatisfied in this product! The stitching is very poor!
B0024KM7OG|5|very good adapter for disposable liners
B0073WEZU4|1|Looks good but reception is really poor compared to traditional antenna
B006WHKKGY|5|works perfect
B007Y583FI|5|great
B00ZZRP0VM|5|I received the AWEEK Auto EPS 12V 16800 Emergency Jump Starter in exchange for my unbiased opinion. This product is perfect for all of your family's needs. It has all the accessories you ever possibly need. All nicely inside a durable handy zippered case that holds everything included in the kit together and organized. I love that it fits perfectly in my sons car. But it also can be taken out and be with me on the go when traveling. It really can jump start a car if need be. The first day it arrived we used it straight out the package to jump start my sons 1998 ford mustang several times. It works on Gasoline-powered as well as Diesel vehicles. It is very handy and includes a LED flash light with emergency lighting options. It has protection features that protect against over-current, over-charging, and short-circuits. It features many accessories for many needs such as charging your cell phone and laptop. This product has come in handy and it is a product I highly recommend to everyone even if you dont own a vehicle it will come in handy and get lots of use.
B00WMM6V8E|5|Perfect for car. 30min install car runs great
B0073JDIFK|5|I love these, they are great
B00B9EZF5G|5|Fast delivery and it fits perfectly!
B008GGJIHG|5|Love those lights, after slight modification on my  E60 2010 535i ( they're a litlle to long ) they work amazing for about 2 months so far.
B00QSNZ18Y|5|These were exactly what I needed and the seller really went the extra mile to help with the mistake that the post office made. Thumbs up!
B0031GTXQW|5|Great products at unbeatable prices.  Expedite delivery. Superb customer service.
B00QAMKNYK|5|Great to have in the jeep instead of looking for tools to fit.
B00BJ4EDQS|5|Bought this part to solve a CEL that's been nagging me for a few weeks, DTC code p0456 very small EVAP system leak.  These very small leaks are usually due to loose gas caps but this one kept coming back no matter how much I tightened my fuel cap so I did some research on the internet and found Nissans among others are prone to having this vent control valve fail.  The part hangs off the charcoal canister underneath the rear passenger side of my 09 Murano and is accessible without putting the vehicle on a lift.  I popped my OEM unit out, no tools needed, cleaned it up and tested the spring which moved easily.  I then checked for continuity across the electrical terminals and that also checked out fine.  So next I put a 12 volt power source on it and --- nothing, the solenoid was dead.  Bingo.  Nissan has apparently had a lot of issues with these in various vehicles and has even redesigned the unit a couple of times.  This Dorman part looks a lot like Nissan's latest redesign but for around half the cost.  The older version is still available, Dorman part number 911-503, for around fifteen bucks less but I figured I might as well update it while I'm at it.  The old part was 100% plastic, this newer version has a metal body surrounded by a plastic shell apparently in an effort to make it more durable and resistant to damage.  Refitting the new part took some effort.  The rubber o-ring doesn't seem to want to compress enough to allow the part to slide into the charcoal canister and engage the tab locks.  After quite a bit of fiddling and cursing I ended up lubing the o-ring and the part slid right in.  Quarter turn to the right, refit the hose and electrical connector and you're done.  I cleared my DTC codes and drove the car a bit then let it sit for awhile so it could run its EVAP system pressure test.  Couple hours later I checked and all monitors showed ready to go with no codes.  Problem solved.  Don't worry about ordering a non-OEM part, this Dorman unit seems tobe built well and really can't be any worse than the failure prone Nissan unit.  One complaint and this has more to do with Amazon's delivery policy.  Most items I order from the internet that get shipped from Southern California to my home in Northern California take at most 1 or 2 days to get delivered regardless of whether I select economy ground shipping or something more expensive.  But Amazon's economy shipping took 8 full days to deliver this item.  I could have walked the item from L.A. to my home in 8 days.  It's as if they're deliberately dragging their feet and delivering more slowly because I live too close to the shipping point and they want to get me to pay extra for express shipping.  I don't know of any other retailer who does this sort of thing.
B00NH36786|3|Decent paint gun for the price.
B0085IJNNY|5|worked out great
B00395444G|5|Works and looks great.
B00X7CC07E|5|Nice kit for JW Speaker 8700 installation. (installed it on Road King 2004)
B001CO4WA2|1|has only two months of use and started to dump oil or epoxy and heated too
B004AIHKT2|5|this little jewel worked like a champ, built much heaver than original, which was plastic, a lot riding on a very small plastic hook for a sprimg that has to work every time to get the gear lever out on park, the replacement was metal and the hook bracket  is built considerably heavy and it was only 12 bucks and change, this is a job that can save you lots of money with just a little time, jut look it on youtube, lots of examples to look at and learn how to save some money
B00ADDR8WC|5|loving it,  got it for my little boy and girl  sick!
B00063ZPOM|5|Great tree
B00F4DKU2G|4|Everything needed came with the kit. Fit better than expected and sounded even better. For the money you can't beat it. Very satisfied.
B00429NKWK|5|Works great requires a bit a work headlights looks almost as good as new
B00CTUSEMU|5|perfect
B00AFBXQNC|5|Very fast shipping. Very professional. Great shampoo! My recommendation
B008DIZ1S2|5|LOVE THIS! Very classy, not ghetto fab at all! Perfect for the girlie girl!
B00BD9RI6G|5|Fantastic workmanship! As my interior is blacks, greys, and billet aluminum this is prefect. &#34;Dressed&#34; it up a bit to further match my interior by finding some black o-rings to fit in the grooves .
B0002NIK3E|5|Arrived quickly and fit the spare tire well..
B007KPSEWY|3|This gasket set fitment was correct.  However, the primary cover gasket protrudes from the cover.  Doesn't look right and could cause leaks in the future.
B001DRLO4U|3|My mechanic installed this for me yesterday... would have been a &#34;direct fit&#34; except the flange end had been welded slightly off-center by the manufacturer thereby reducing the available inside diameter of the pipe... as such it would not slip over the male pipe from my VW like it should have.  Mechanic had to torch and re-weld a bit to get it to work.  Took him and extra 1/2 hour (which cost me an extra $40) to do the job.  Seems like a well constructed, high quality catalytic converter otherwise.
B000HRWGKS|4|I bought 2 of these, one for me and one for a friend.  Mine has worked great.  My friends melted.  They were running the AC and accidentally ran the microwave (while on a generator).  Unfortunately the outlet didn't trip, so it got extremely hot and melted the puck.  I've heard other issues with these because they cram a lot of copper into a small space.  Mine is still working though and we're just careful not to overload it.
B0023VDAVU|5|like
B009G7OL7G|5|For the price this product is absolutely amazing it holds the rope in place perfectly. I also bought the product shoreline marine goop with the item and I love that as well. It holds the Cleat. Down on my canoe perfectly.
B008F8Q86E|5|Worked just great!! I will buy more when needed!!
B00TL9R9J6|5|Fun
B0024E6QX0|5|Made a huge difference in the heat coming into the camper! Highly recommend buying these.
B00D5CGET6|5|The starter is identical to the one removed only it works! Easily bolted on. Came 1 day sooner than expected.
B00NH1W52U|5|Great product for the price...
B00UNRUJ7E|4|thanks
B001O0AMNK|5|Fits my Helo Wheels great on my eclipse 97
B0002CADSK|4|Direct replacement for a Volvo Penta 740 B V8 330HP engine
B008KY5ULW|5|Nice meters, came fast. they are accurate. Bought several.  All read the same....
B0093RRSXS|4|Good
B003Q8UJCM|2|decent.  I like the logo and the function.  Wish the material was more substantial.  If towels have thickness this is on the thin side.  I sweat like a pig and these don't hold it all.  In 90 degree weather, 80% humidity- it's gotta be able to handle my pig sweat.
B001CEG90I|5|Fits good
B00V5Q9G3A|2|Cheap, and doesn't fit right on my bars, quick delivery though
B00NLULY9M|4|These did not work in my 2013 Mini Cooper R56 JCW. It threw an error code since the ECU monitors bulb out conditions. JDM Astar was excellent in email replies and suggested the correct replacement Canbus bulbs while quickly refunding for these being returned. These are great and bright, just didn't work in my car so got 4 stars.
B00ZOKJVAG|5|Works perfectly no hassle
B000EQLCTI|1|The gasket fell apart and wasted $80 if atf fluid, Auto Zone has a rubber gasket with a premium filter for less money
B001TF7V5C|5|Great Product. Very Nice!
B00WIV15SU|5|Good quality and fast shipping
B003UWY4C0|5|Great Product. Very Nice!
B00QK3ZXCQ|5|Really great wipers
B000HBNU9U|5|I LIKE IT
B00FHSOF0G|5|Great prod and sizing was correct
B008CE09PM|5|Arrived fast and as described.
B00MB0D3QK|4|Bought this here on Amazon due to price. Overall good quality and I use it every day.
B00CGAERCE|5|Everybody loves my zombie Jeep wave hand.
B004XN57UI|5|Haven't installed yet, but appears to heavier and better built than the Marinco that I put in my last camper.
B004YK4S1O|5|Nice and heavy
B009S2ZQNM|5|I bought this abut a month ago and so far it is holding up to what it sad. I love the fell of it and looks grate on my 96 F150 XLT 4X4. I even use to shut my door. easy install, they say you have to take door panel off but you don't  took me 1min poor door.
B00A448NYW|1|Product was good, for about 2 months. Randomly stopped working. Inquired about the 90 day warranty that iJDMTOY is supposed include with all their products. But because my item was shipped via PRIME, Jay from iJDMTOY claims it does not cover my order. Only wanted to replace the defective control unit, not a refund. He still gave me a hard time all because I chose to get it faster with my Prime membership that I pay $100 a year for.
B00D42AFS8|5|I bought this item for a &#34;just in case&#34; situation. I left it charged in my trunk and hoped that it would come in handy. I used it a few times to charge my phone in emergency situations. A few weeks ago and many months after I purchased it, the unit performed flawlessly. My car battery was dead, I hooked it up and my car started right up. This thing works great and the people around me were asking where they could get one!
B00NCR2UCY|5|I got this for my electric wheelchair and its perfect. I have headlight,tail lights and now turn signal and strobe, its rechargeable too.
B006VB8JTQ|2|I followed the instructions on how to properly do this and even after the third try it still didn't come out shiny instead it came out hazy. I did everything in the 9 steps but still no luck. I would spend your money on something better quality. These items are cheaply made and are only good for use on one car.
B000R5KT7W|2|The spring clip and retention ball broke on the 2nd use.  This is actually pretty serious, as it could have fallen into an oil hole or coolant hole and caused serious problems if not removed.
B004J30GJY|5|GREAT
B0052XN2RI|4|The fitment is incorrect. I have a 2011 FX4 Ecoboost F-150. According to Amazon it fits, but it's wobble, wobble... the clamp is going to break if I do more. It looks great. I am sure the local muffler shop will spot weld it for $10.
B00I9TNKX8|5|Delivered extremely quickly and nice packaging. All lights worked correctly the first time with no hiccups, great price for the quality
B00Y480W3Y|5|[[VIDEOID:a24bf324652de3aa7a7496c956884350]]This is perfect to charge and leave in your car. If your car battery decides to die on you, then you have something that will quickly rectify that situation. You charge this before you put it in the vehicle, and every few months take it back out and recharge it. And you will never be stuck, you won't have to call a tow truck service for a jump, or have to you ask a stranger to help you.<br /><br />This is also great to use as a power bank if your phone dies, or any of your other devices. This kid actually comes with adapters for all different kinds of phones, and laptops, computers. Game systems... Just in case you have your kids with you and they get bored.<br /><br />I like the fact that this has a emergency light. Being able to have everything in one set is really cool. The LED emergency lane has three different modes, the SOS is really nice, but the high mode is exactly that. After I charged it and hooked it up, I wanted to blind my husband for a minute. He told me to stop shopping so I thought that that may have warranted a moment of blindness. OK, this can last for up to 120 hours with the emergency light! I didn't even know that that was possible, but if you are ever stuck in a emergency situation, knowing that the light is not going to go off is going to be a comfort to you.<br /><br />I would recommend this, I think every one person who owns a vehicle needs to have this in their car.<br /><br /> I received this product at a discounted rate. I chose to do the review on my own.
B0033PFZ4U|3|The seatbelt covers are really thick. They kind of get in the way. You have to keep repositioning them every time you put on the seatbelt because it's too thick to slide up and down on its own.
B00DUFC8ZM|4|It's a bit big for my car.  All other factors are great!
B00BI170BC|5|This is the only product that I will use on my boat cover.  Great stuff!!!!
B0029TQDLA|5|Very easy to hang, very much like them!!
B00D3298A0|5|These mats are so durable for the time that I've had them installed! Love how heavy duty they are, great to handle dirt and sand! They were easy to install and fit Perfectly in my 2012 Toyota Camry! Can't wait to test them out in my Suburban and see how they feel. Might have to get me a second set! Already had to clean them because of my nephew but they were so easy to wipe of with a little warm water! Don't particularly like the smell but that'll go away with time (:
B00TQ07IOQ|5|Really really nice and great price
B0001MQ7E0|2|Sure don't cool to 40 degrees below ambient temperature, lucky to get it to 30 below ambient temp!
B000WEPI4M|5|It fits perftectly in my RAV4 SUV - Love it!
B00Y5O15GA|1|Very cheap, don't buy
B00PFI7A3W|5|Work and look great!  Easy installation except for the gas pedal which required me to drill holes.  This is no complaint since I purchased these for a Mazda instead of a Honda.  Great buy!
B00GRHSU5C|4|Well made.  Great option on a budget.
B009J6AAGU|5|Hard to find. Works better than any other product I have tried.
B002UC4XPY|5|Easy to install, set up and use.  Consistently as accurate as I would expect a non-precision instrument to be.
B0099TWPC4|3|I did not have a chance to &#34;test&#34; it out before having to strap & go. Seems to be a recurring  theme with biker types... My biggest complaint is 1 side of the adjustment buckle broke while I was trying to tighten it securely to the sissy bar.that made keeping 1 of the 2 main straps tight wasn't happening.the other thing that I do not like is the inside of the part made to slip over the sissy bar is lined with a cheep thin material that tore off the 1st time I took the pack off the bike. In my opinion, this is a good middle of the road pack. for the price I am satisfied. the problems where solved with a phone call. It also made a great backrest and I still felt fresh after 400 mi. :-}
B000VS7EUU|5|Item easy to install on my 2011 Patriot! Looks good! Make sure you use screws after drilling 4 holes to secure it! 3M striping is nice but I like the re-enforcement of the screws. I did not have to remove rubber strip on Jeep! I am very satisfied with this item! Make sure you register it for lifetime warranty!
B007XE5LTG|5|Work great!
B004JO9FGI|5|My 19 year old daughter LOVED these!  My husband LOVED the quality!
B00HZ870GM|1|This didn't work for my car like they told me it would.
B00893H7G0|1|These did not fit my 2014 subaru outback as it was supposed to.
B00INL0Y2M|5|So far so good
B000C5SGEU|5|I was a little suspicious about if it would fit. But it does it's the exact one for a Montero sport 2001. Buy it for shore.  I will have it in my list just in case I need it again.
B00FLY938K|4|So far, I really like the performance of the amp.  it is giving my 2 6x9 marine speakers plenty of power and sounds great!.  I was hesistant buying the amp though, since it is more designed for a motorcycle but i ended up using it to amplify my two jbl marine speakers in my 17ft bass boat.  I decided to go with this amp because it would give my speakers more power than a traditional cd head unit that gives off 22rms typically, and it has bluetooth, radio, usb, sd card, and an aux cord hookup.  By just buying the amp and the speakers, i saved money not having to buy a head unit and got more power out of the speakers in the process.  My speakers are 100rms per speaker, and 300 watts peak.  Remember, RMS is much more important than max wattage this is the one that really determines your speakers/amps power.  Because it is not listed, i will let you know that the amp is 75 watts rms per channel.  A few things regarding the amp, there are no direct speaker hookups on the back you have to use two rca connections which was a pain in the butt for me.  But this is my fault since i bought an amp not specfically designed for a boat.  So i ended up buying speaker wire, and then used connections to hold the speaker wire to two rca adaptors and it worked perfectly.  If you go to radio shack, they will know what you need which is what i did since i am in no means mechanically inclined.  The remote works good, but it does not work great through obstructions. A few cons, the bluetooth is old school! bluetooth with an antenna hookup, same with the radio.   I tried hooking it up and it sounds decent, but when the music is softer interference and weird noises occur.  What i ended up doing was buying a bluetooth reciever for 20 bucks that hooks into an aux line and it works great now!  Also, Keep in mind, the EQ does work on the amp, they have 5 or 6 eq settings like rock, rap, etc.  but it can only be changed when you are using an sd card or an usb connection.  Once you change the eq on one of those two connection types, that eq will save and work on the bluetooth, audio input, and radio setting.  Its kinda weird and also annoying lol, not sure why you cant change the eq when using the other functions but this is not a huge concern.  I usually just leave the EQ on the pop setting seems to sound the best. So far, i am super happy with the amp.  I am suprised they could power my 2 6X9s with so little ease!
B002FPC85I|5|Perfect, no issues at all
B00TUSXIFW|5|Easy to install. It's been two months, no problems. Went to auto parts store and they wanted over $100!
B00QXU3LRU|5|All good really works good,and deliverey was alsom.
B000CA55YO|5|Nice
B006OEJVRO|5|I can now tell which car is mine in a crowded parking lot.
B00P9OF04I|5|Just got this in the mail today (thanks Amazon Prime!) and tried it out. I've used the 3M kit with a corded drill on 3 of my cars over the years, and just cleaned my '98 Contour SVT headlights with the 3M kit last Winter. Even after sealing and waxing the headlights they were already rough looking now in late August. I have to say, that even if this Mequiar's product only gets me by for roughly 12 months, I'll probably be using it again. Very little effort required and the results blow away the result of the 3M kit. I spent about 5 minutes per headlight between scrubbing them with the included pad and liquid, cleaning the dry headlights twice before applying the clear spray. I spent 10 minutes per headlight with the 3M kit using all the various sanding pads with a corded drill, and the clarity doesn't compare to the Mequiar's kit. I hope it gets me by for at least 9-12 months.... we'll see!
B00TEICVHY|5|fits center console opening perfect on 12 Tacoma. I use to charge my devices without the need for separate car charger. does two galaxy phones at the same time effortlessly. this is lighted with a small blue led. which I didn't realize until I had already wired it to battery, so the light is on constant(can not be seen when cover is in place)
B00IX23ZFO|4|I am getting better gas milage but I changed other things at the same time. Easy install and cheap. Jeep wj 4.0.
B00M3TZT02|2|Bought for TuneECU/ Triumph Tiger.<br />Can't get my laptop to recognize the correct usb port routing.

This product fits UNDER the shelf.<br />  2003 Toyota 4Runner Notes: Gray; w/Optional Cargo Shelf Only; Cargo Liner Covers Full Floor When Shelf Is Raised;<br /><br />If you want to cover the TOP of the Cargo Shelf I ordered  the following Husky liner - it covers the entire back including the the little side cups by the tail gate.

B002NY5FHE|5|Great Product. Very Nice!
B008BYQBUA|5|nice winch.....but its a warn it should be.cant go wrong
B0043G7FV4|5|Excellent package.  My son got this as a birthday present and he worked on his car himself.  He's a teenager who drives a fast a furious type low rider Honda Civic and he cares more about looks then maintenance or safety so I was happy to push him in the direction of keeping his car operational and safe.
B00T85ANNW|4|The feeler gauges are very satisfactory.  I would just mentioned that they are packed with quite a bit of machine oil on them; be careful when you take them out of the plastic &quot;case&quot; if you want to avoid staining your clothing.
B007EEVKZE|5|worked as promised.
B0047AKKAE|3|Despite the nubs on one side intended to cling on to the car's carpeted floor, they do move around like others already mentioned simply the nubs or spikes are not look or hard enough to bite into the carpet...but still better than the alternative of not having them in raining muddy days.
B00T5G53ZM|4|A few years ago I spent over $100 for a similar item, but it only worked with a propriety software / display device and was very limited in what it could do.  This unit provides the same data and works with multiple display options (I'm using the Torque program that was included with the purchase on my Android tablet and it's suiting my needs well).  It's a perfect tool to have when fault codes show up, and can provide some interesting data on driving habits when using the logging function.
B0041CABR0|2|Just a headsup, they say it comes w/ 360 in a box but you'll only actually receive 10. 2 stars because they are wheel weights that look like they'll work just fine, however it's terrible value for the money.
B002P432IG|5|Arrived fast and as described.
B00EY2QL1M|2|The wiring was for the Genesis sedan, not the coupe.  When I got it, the product description stated &#34;coupe&#34;.
B00XV4W686|5|Bright, work very well on VW Jetta 2.0 T FSI  (front turn signals) Not listed as CAN BUS friendly however work fine in 2008 VW Jetta Wolfsburg
B000M5Y720|5|Definitely a great improvement over the OEM HB4 low beam bulb that was installed.  Beam pattern in wider and shines out in front further and produces much whiter light. Cant speak to logivity yet but visibilty is worth a shorter life span.
B000C5I6H2|4|The kit had what I needed in it, but next time I will buy just the clips for the tail gate rods.
B000C9XZ6K|4|wix always a quality product.
B00F4PB8IY|5|Great product.  It is difficult to find a cleaner that is not also a conditioner.  I will order this product again.
B0086QCANU|4|nice stickers could stick better though
B004RCYXCS|5|Worked perfectly as replacement for the seized master cylinder on my boat trailer. It was very easy to change, all parts were included.
B00QYKZHFS|5|A good brand and great shopping next day. But I got defective bulbs. Hopefully they handle the exchange well
B004IA3YQK|5|this is the way to go for higher temps 65w-100w lamps
B00C80HSU0|4|I was expecting this light to be just a little bigger, but after I mounted it in my vehicle it is perfect.  Great flash patterns, will work wonderfully for my small town volunteer service.
B00JDPP06M|5|Great helmet  I would buy again.
B000C5GAUM|5|Great buy
B00II8HHP2|5|Easy Install Looks Great
B007O5GX14|5|The wire harness was the wrong one, it didn't fit my 08 f150 but it came with the extra cable to hardwire it, so I cut my stock harness off and hardwired it. Works wonders
B00AJTIQSU|5|Fits as expected.
B00NQ19AG0|5|Super easy to install, reliable quality. Just what I was looking for!
B001CEG90I|4|good fit for both my 2014 Sienna and 2012 Lexus CT200h.  I do see there is a reduced airflow like other reviewers on here but not really noticeable.
B00I1MVEVI|5|Buy this product! It delivers!! I've had 2 jeeps, both w/ $650.00 plus K&N FIPK Intake kits. K&N is awesome for sure. But I got to hand it to this Intake Kai out of California. I am mechanically inclined, but I am no mechanic. The instructions were step by step and easy to follow. My one grip is that they looked like they have copied way too many times and the pictures are pretty blurry, but good enough to get the job done for sure.<br />  I was skeptical having only used K&N b4. But I am on a budget big time! This was only $91 and change, so instead of over 4,5, or even $600.00?? What the hell right? It's awesome! Install was smooth. My censors mounted right up to beautiful intake tube, and not to mention??? It totally performs!! It's loud as hell. It sealed perfectly! (For all you novices, a true cold air intake should be totally sealed w/ exception to the filter cone or you will lose some HP.) this thing looks rad, and actually puts the the filter far enough away from the VERY hot 4.7L V-8 it's made for. It shifts the cone almost to the fire wall. The rubber and foam the heat shield comes with is plenty, I may &#34;wall off&#34; some more gaps and holes of the shield to block even more heat, but I'm not sure how necessary that is. All I can say is, some of the stuff sold online for &#34;after market&#34; performance parts, is always you get what you pay for!!! This? Knowing what I know now?  Made me a total believer! Even if you have the money to blow?? Don't! Buy this intake instead, help this seller out! This was an amazing deal, and it is totally even, if not better than his competitors and drastically cheaper! Good luck!! Go Seahawks!!
B000TXYDK6|1|Same as the Haynes manual.
B004JA9EJ0|5|Exact fit.
B006WHQ5JA|5|Fast ship works great
B00K8XD7LS|5|Awwww yis!
B00AH820SU|5|no problem
B006FSUFX8|1|Does not have the chip and will not start car..opens door only
B0089LT6KM|3|fit perfect in 2013 Honda fit with easy installation after checking out a youtube video. nothing different from other similar products but was the best deal when I purchased it.
B0007ZHA92|5|Installed on a BMW motorcycle to see the blind spots behind in heavy traffic. Look OK and mount easily.
B00P99KKAM|5|I It, super happy... It looks amazing..
B00ANSQZFI|5|These are stunning and go with the rest of the iridescent pieces on my bike. They are sprocket nuts so they only stay pretty and shiny if the bike is sitting. If you ride often they get super greasy. I'll have to take an old toothbrush to them before I show at Motorama.
B000COMXI6|5|Best quality product. I had ordered a Chinese built TireTek gauge which I found faulty on arrival and cheap quality while similar price. And I had to return that and I got this. Looked awesome straight out of the box. Must have for any Truck driver in his tool box.
B004K25GMQ|4|I bought this after realizing I have an $1800 item sitting in the garage that was starting to get items stacked on top of it.  It just makes sense that it should be stored in a case and kept out of the way.<br />The fabric is tough with sturdy zippers.  Overall I would say that the case is well thought out and built well.<br />The dividers for the windows are thicker than your typical fleece blanket.<br />It holds the larger windows on the MY14+ 4-doors just fine.<br />I would give it 5 stars except it does have one very slight issue.  By no means a show-stopper, but if this was a perfect product it would have a pocket for the window frame and rear window hardware.  The bag is roomy enough to hold it all if you don't mind the smaller pieces just flopping about inside.<br /><br />I consider this a must-buy for Wrangler owners that would store the soft-top for any extended amount of time.
B0022ZFP6U|5|Highly recommended
B00AI3XVGE|5|quality chain for the money especially for a low budget project
B000A6TIFM|5|Very fast shipping and very happy with it.
B00ZKUTDZ8|5|So happy my item came
B000C2YC6O|5|perfect
B00VP9SQLA|4|Cool
B001BCLW6M|5|Cheap and fit perfectly. Mirror was clear and sharp, not like a &#34;fun house&#34; mirror like some reviews said.
B003COQAKA|5|Great price, great product!!
B000C9GYOA|1|the control unit that came with my suburban lasted 15 years. the replacement did not even last one year. for the price one would think at least a few years of service would have been nice. the A/C button light goes out all the time and I have to keep resetting the button, another bump in the road, reset A/C button.
B004FJPS5Y|5|OEM Product- fits perfectly on the Odyssey! Make sure to grab a set of the 08L04-TK8-100 Crossbars to have a complete set. Installation took about 1 hour total.
B00030BFQA|5|Works great try it out first day
B002UC2QOO|5|Good replacement, and works as expected.  I replaced a plastic one, and this one should last the life of the trailer.
B010G0QTC6|5|First time ever using a DA or any kind of buffer, was nice and easy to operate. Used on 67 firebird that had been freshly painted, after wet sanding i cut and polished the car, came out GREAT! so again, easy enough for a first time user.
B00NVK71OE|5|I got this for my daughter to give her uncle for his birthday and he love it. He said its one of the nicest key-chain he ever had and perfect for his Mustang GT. It well made with the red that matches his mustang gt.
B00LBICFNK|5|Great product,i tested them for about a month on my 2010 Bmw 535i and no problems so far. awesome customer service. Thank You so much!!!
B000KL3AJW|5|great value for the price
B004V5YR68|5|Works great - love it
B00HS5KQJA|5|Very good and on time with delivery
B00D11F78A|5|good item, good seller
B00GS2CZG6|5|I've had this for about a month now and it work great on my 2005 Ram.  100% waterproof as advertised and it keeps the dust and dirt of the paint.  Also, the inner lining is soft so it won' scratch the paint.  It survived a thunder storm with high winds.  The strapping to hold the cover in place work great.  I plan on ordering another one for my 73' Duster.  Very happy with this product and it gets my stamp of approval!
B001CEG90I|5|Fixed the smell inside my van thanks
B00G620ZVU|5|awesome and great price, Liked them so much I bought another  set.
B0049HKFIM|4|Excellent product.  Perfect fitment. This is the newest edition according to online sources. Had a check engine light for gas cap leak. All fixed now.
B00HRY8HH0|1|This part not fet Cadillac CTS 2008 to 2014 because upper mount for shock is high . You can not but the nut  The head for  sen sen is to short than original
B008P04QKM|5|This mirror is an exact replacement for what originally came on my Chevy Uplander from the factory. Installation was straightforward after removing door panel. If you feel uneasy working on door panels the seek a mechanic. I am. Also order some push fasteners (about 10) because you may break some.
B00RV417XM|5|The light is super bright and super crisp, brighter than a stock 1157 incandescent bulb.  I also bought an aftermarket signal relay flasher unit to prevent hyper-flashing.  Important note regarding the functioning of these bulbs: they are voltage level dependent for color selection.  What that means is that at partial voltage, they run white, at full voltage they run amber.  So if your parking lights normally light to full voltage (ie. full brightness), these bulbs will light as steady amber, not white.  Then during signalling, when the voltage is zero/full/zero/full, you will get off/amber/off/amber.  You will only get the white colored light during partial voltage (when your parking or signal light is on but not at full brightness, and you are not signalling). If your signal function goes full-bright/half-bright/full-bright/half-bright, these lights will signal as amber/off/amber/off as described.
B00WVJR0D8|5|WOW this is one bright LED headlight and looks the business too. It seems well made and the ballast is small about .25 in thick and only 1 1/2 inch square, and can be mounted almost anywhere. You can hear the fan (its just a quiet buzz) with the motorcycle off but once you start the engine you can't hear it. This is one of the only LED headlights with a 2 year no questions asked warranty! This LED if you ask me is much better than an old Halogen bulb! However there isn't much difference between high and low beam but there is some. I recommend this bulb if you want to keep the stock look of the bike yet make a major upgrade to your lighting!
B008OLRZ4Q|5|Fit my NC1 MX-5 and matched the OEM nuts.
B00L9NEI2I|5|Look great and work great. Directions are a little sketchy with little details. But theyou look great on my mustang.
B00JG95RWC|4|Got this lift a few mounts back and had to get long ublots then what was provided but that was only $10 or $15 at an auto parts store have enjoyed it sence clears 31s fine with no scurb It was under $100 to get in installed to
B00QSLNKI4|5|good replacement for the price. Didn't feel like paying for OEM of $85+ shipping. This does the job just fine.
B005JDSU1Y|1|junk, will not come off anymore after a few weeks in rain and weather....Aluminium will corrode into your brass thread valve stems.....had to ruin the valve caps to take em off.....JUNK !!
B001GP790W|5|its a great product . i have a black car and its great to touch up.
B001PT7XBE|5|Excellent! Used it for my new 1800 watt 5 channel car amp! Easily turn off and on circuit from under hood . No more than 18 inches from battery . Well built . Best I've seen . I've purchased 2 now!
B0041TQSK2|5|as advertised
B0071I34PW|5|I was satisfied. Thank you.
B00PYENX1U|3|Good plasti paint, It was ok when I applied to my rims not really the color I wanted yet I still used it.  My rims did look ok.
B00APOBCTE|4|Looks great, but I wish it held the plate securely on the bottom.
B00YB2SUZK|5|Match my stock foot pads and a lot cheaper than Harley's. Look great and good quality.
B00F66VURA|5|Perfect fit, great price for an item that breaks often.
B007CVSE30|4|I had had it with these truck web covers that had hooks all around them.  The hooks drove me crazy when I tried to unfurl the web.  The hooks were catching on the web in every possible way making getting the net over my load a frustrating affair.  This is a very heavy duty web.  You supply your own tie down items which I am happy to supply.  I am going to have this web net for years.
B00QN864YE|2|Well, I love the look of the frame, but the design is just cheap stickers.  I don't foresee these lasting very long through rain, heat and carwashes.
B003NHH6LI|5|These are better than factory lift supports in my opinion. They will lift the hood up by themselves. Strong Arm is the perfect name.<br />When installing them on my 02 Dodge ram 1500, I couldn't get them to simply press/push on the stud the way the instructions implied.<br />I pulled up on the metal clip and pulled it out too far thinking it was ok, it would pop back into place easily. In pulling it out to far, it bent the clip a lil and wasn't holding as well as I would have liked but I think it will be ok.<br />I wish they would have mentioned this in the instructions.<br />The second one I just took a flat head screw driver and put it in the slot under the clip and pried up just enough to get it to push onto the stud. That is what I recommend to anyone that has the same trouble.<br /><br />Love these....
B011Q18D14|5|Very nice code scanner. Actually worked quite well. Before acquiring this scanner, was having some engine sputtering issues with a 2005 Chrysler Town & Country and had tried various things. Tried changing the plugs, plug wires and the fuel filter. Still having the same issues. Granted those things needed to be done, but that didn't solve my dilemma. After receiving this, hooked it up and found out it had bad compression on cylinder 5. Stuck rings was the issues. Took it to my local shop and had it fixed and returned rather quickly. That was the issue and this little scanner helped figure it out. Now the van is back on the road again and running great. Great little ODB II Scanner. Worked like a champ.<br /><br />Solid little design and build on this. Obviously, it's no high end scanner by any means. But it does work and works well. Everything seems to be decently made and the unit, cable and plug on this are very nice quality. For the price, this thing is great. I was truly impressed by it.<br /><br />I... Read more
B000C18Q3A|5|I have always purchased Sylvania headlights and they have always performed well also. If they don't last long in your vehicle, perhaps you have a voltage problem. They always last in my vehicles
B00BJLXODY|5|I put these plugs in my Stihl, Husqvarna and Toro engines, and each performed admirably.
B000FGI34E|5|Works great
B00XVC785Y|5|I bought this at Costco for much cheaper and it works great! Sure its a little tough to mount but I mounted mine with zip ties to my peg board and it holds strong.  The product itself is great but if you aren't somewhat skilled it could be difficult to mount.
B000UDL8AS|5|Great purchase.  The product, supplier and shipping were all great.  Thanks,
B00BAZCPW0|5|These bulbs are just what I needed.  Use in my motorcycle driving lamps.  They are white light.  I would recommend.
B000EQ74BI|5|As advertised, quick delivery
B00849PGZI|1|Does NOT fit on a 2011 cbr 600rr.<br />Although it say's it does, it doesn't. I'm sure it doesn't fit on any cbr 600 from 09-15, I could be wrong, but they haven't changed much so I'd assume it doesn't fit. No clue on the 1000's
B010QU0SPU|5|As advertised, quick delivery
B007RW2WUU|2|As others have mentioned the gasket is too thick.  After much pushing and prodding, I finally got it to fit my 2011 Hyundai Tucson.
B00L4N4594|5|great product
B001AGE2WK|5|This solved my faulty injector problem and the check engine light hasn't come on since installing it. If I need injectors again, I would have no problem using these.
B00CB4YHO8|5|excellent, highly recommend them
B002GUYW7O|5|It worked it is perfect.
B003HBWM96|5|Love it!
B0128SDK9E|1|Very disappointed. Already fogging imside

B00HLACXTS|5|I bought these for my boyfriend for his banshee and he loves them.
B0002LWET2|4|product works very good
B00480J4KA|5|Mechanic quoted $180, I bought this for less than $40. It works great!
B007KSY5W4|4|Perfect replacement for an RV exhaust fan.
B009G5ERVS|5|easy to install fit perfect
B0101A0C38|5|♡
B001B16NP8|5|Came intact, I have been using this for years in my 2001 7.3L diesel 14 years old and still no smoke. There's no sediment at the bottom of the container, none. A very clean oil out of the box.
B00KJGPN2K|5|good and fast
B00JJ68AJ4|1|Hard to assemble, I gave it away
B000JFJM14|5|Just as described works  perfect I would recommend this product to family and friends
B000WJX6IM|3|I've only used it one time.  I'm not entirely satisfied with it but I hope to rate this product HIGHER the next time I use it.
B0002Z9QO4|5|Worked Great, two on top of Yukon
B00LEBLI82|2|Replaced the 1156 incandescent bulbs in my motor. Very disappointed😧! Bulbs are whiter than incadecents but the brightness is very low. With incadecents one or two bulbs would light it up.  Need to turn on up to six of these on,  to do things like work crossword or play games. Only payoff is less heat generated.
B00C7Y3XDS|5|Fit perfect quick shipping
B000LN4IQS|4|Direct replacement for a Volvo Penta 740 B engine
B0009VA8MK|5|Fits my Honda Accord 2004 perfectly.
B00VSAJI5E|4|These chrome  side steps from Black Horse are awesome. They fit my 2015 Nissan Rogue SL very well. I love the look. Now the bad, the included instructions are a JOKE!! I was an engineer in the Navy for 21 years and it took me a while to figure it out. Also the write up say no drill instalation, but there is one bolt that is optional. After 2 hours I got it done by myself and really like the finished  product.  Would have given it 5 star if it weren't  for the very bad instructions.
B001KO15UY|5|Perfect fit & replacement to the Cycra Probends at a great price.
B000NZSR5W|1|I can confirm the other reviews that this product is low quality. Purchased this early May 2015 and the one light was not working. Returned it for replacement which was great, but this past week one light failed again. I am going back to OEM lights.
B001AVVZ66|5|Strong & durable steel sprocket at a great price. Perfect fit on factory 2013 KTM wheels.
B000CO94E2|1|Button/switch is fine, brighter than my old one. However the cap is pure junk. The method to hold it in is just friction and a total fail.  I bought this kit a few years back and the retention design then was the same as stock. That one is still going strong in my other truck. This new design does not work at all, popping off every time I shift. Lasted only two weeks before it fell off and got lost, leaving me no better shape than I was before I bought it. Don't waste your money.  Booo Dorman. Should have left the design alone and went with the design created by Ford's engineers.
B00G620ZVU|5|very bright good lights i love them, haven't leaked or fogged up been submerged in mud
B006CRETZ2|5|Great deal for the price!
B001S80ZE4|5|Worked as designed
B00H892N9M|5|Heavy duty should last for years..One huge pocket on inside for more weight. Velcro to keep on cable.
B000IZ0WSC|5|Worked as designed
B000WJFCUW|2|The item shown and described is not correct. Amazon is reviewing this and will correct it at some point. Dowco shows the correct item on their website. I actually received a simple plastic or thin nylon bag with a draw string at the bottom. There is another draw string mid way up inside so this can be used with a double stack of Dowco luggage. I received one of these when I purchased the &#34;Main&#34; bag and it blew off the first time I used it. Guess I'll need some extra straps to make it more secure.
B008TWZSQM|5|Works great for me, a bit pricey for what it is, I hope it was at least made in the US.
B000E2AR6G|5|Arrived fast and as described.
B0053TVKN4|5|Arrived fast and as described.
B00X3YHGIE|4|Works as advertised.  Wish the hose was a little longer.
B00BCR8RJ6|5|love the way they look in my trk
B00GRBGIES|5|Very good
B00ZA6L4LS|5|we are avid off road racers and these are the perfect size. Like the fact that it is polyester webbing and has a breaking strength of 10,000 pounds. The D-rings are securely attached to the strap. Recommend to everyone that hauls vehicles.
B00230OYR0|4|GOODB JOB
B00KN1T4M6|4|If you're buying this for the sound, be sure to purchase a baffle-less system in conjunction with this product.  Other wise it mostly serves as a great way to clean up the look of your ride. Don't get me wrong there is a little bit of an improvement in the sound of the exhaust, but at higher rpm's and not in the lower ones. So this product can safely be said that it is safe enough to use without the worry of getting any noise violation tickets....at least until you either get your baffle eliminated, or install with this a baffle-less exhaust combo.
B00LNM4A0A|1|Plating is coming off, rusting.  Only three months old.
B002EVU620|5|Good lock. Make sure you actually lock it by pushing the base a bit. Also use a small amount of grease so it doesn't freeze up.
B00KTLZPS2|4|Great quality, and a great intro into riding for my daughter. Well packaged in a metal &#34;cage&#34;... this &#34;cage&#34; can be reused for a variety of things. I used mine as a garden table.<br /><br />The bike is very good looking, and well built. It started up no problem, and runs great. It is a good engine size, with enough power for a new learning rider without being too much. The tires are substantial and perform well on asphalt and offroad.<br /><br />The only negatives points are, it does not have much of a steering radius, so it's hard to make tight turns without leaning a lot, which is hard and possibly dangerous for inexperienced riders. It also doesn't have any neutral, clutch or &#34;engage&#34; lever like some other auto bikes, so whenever it's running, it is &#34;in gear&#34; and the throttle is &#34;live&#34;... this can also be dangerous for inexperienced riders.<br /><br />Overall a great buy, and great service from Amazon.
B00NT5VPJS|3|The cover looks nothing like what is pictured. However, the product is still high quality and the texture is nice, but it's not what is pictured.
B00KJ8JHO8|5|Good price. Nice bright white!
B005WXMAVM|4|fit right
B00HW1TLYQ|5|Amazing stuff!  Bought a beautiful new, red Coach purse off ebay retailing $425 for $94.95 beacause of a very small dark, possibly ink spot on a bottom seam of purse.  Not caring if it came off or not because it wasnt noticable on bottom of purse but also wondered if it would come off?  How do I clean this beautiful, expensive new purse and not take out the red leather dye?<br /><br />A google search led me to this product and so what did I have to loose?  Ordered smallest size bottles of each for trial and not only did the cleaner wipe this spot off bit it brightened up dull, older Born leather sandels I loved and wear relentlessly, took scuff marks off other leather shoes and made each look new again.<br /><br />THEN... Apply this thick, &#34;honey&#34; conditioner which at first I thiught a bit difficult to use and needed wY more than the &#34;small amount goes a ling ways&#34; as claimed... But trust them and me... Keep rubbing with the cloth they sell and spreading thinly as they recommend so not to waste ir have to wipe off next day and oh my goodness....my leather purses and shoes are so beautiful!!!  They glissen and feel so remarkably soft and as they say, they brought new kife into tired, older, previously worn out shoes that look as beautiful after 1 cleaning & 1 coniditioning treatment with this product.<br /><br />So glad google led me to a product that really is worth every penny and I'm totally sold!  After I use these starter bottles up I will be back for the economy size bottles.  Thank you for creating such a great product!
B006B26K3C|4|works perfectly no fitment issues
B00A7YJ59G|5|Just what I needed to secure my car inside my trailer,  as good as the DOT straps for a fair price

B004IAB4DK|5|Works perfect for what I needed.
B009FC8C5Y|5|Fit better than the stock top  GREAT Value
B000CFAVA2|4|Ordered these for my 2006 Honda Ridgeline. They fit my vehicle perfectly, and installed easily in a matter of minutes. They look sleek and do not stick out from the window too far, like some other models do.  Be advised: These occasionally interfere with the auto-up driver's side window function. The auto-up function does not work all of the time with these installed, as the ventshade interferes with the sensor. This is the only reason I give these a 4/5 star rating.  Other than that small issue, I am satisfied with my purchase.
B001N729FS|5|Perfect! Exactly what I wanted!<br /><br />One caution - When you're disconnecting, if you spin the thing too far, the knob will fall right now. Not sure why you'd ever want that feature, but, it's how it's designed. So, beware....
B007PP26RI|5|worked great for a minor exhaust leak in my Ducati 748
B001HLHVN0|5|Thank You!!
B006WQSXSW|1|Parts looked good when they came in but my passenger side went bad in only 11 months.  Come on the factory lasted 10 years. There warranty is a joke. Id stay away
B008VR65GM|4|It finally fit on my 2012 Suzuki C50 Classic but was a struggle to get on. I had to remove it recently when my battery died and the rear seat bracket would not clear the backrest. There is a lot of tension on the brackets.
B0036GL5F4|4|works great
B000CN9A8S|5|Durable  material, looks just like the photo. I am installing these on a 1991 Foxbody  Mustang and the product is thicker than originals which causes a problem trying to seat in the control arm. Amazon delivered fast and at a reasonable price!
B00LNKH41Y|5|Very nice car license  plate cover.
B002AKFA94|5|Love it. Serves the purpose
B00F9RNIPI|5|Once i try the cables out I'll upgrade to 5 stars,overall they look impressive.<br />Excellent jumper cables,for those that don't know about cables,the lower gauge wire delivers the most amount of current.<br />These are 4 gauge and 20 ft,perfect
B00DG7HYSA|5|Airbag Systems, Inc. in Allen Texas programmed this and it worked perfect!
B00GP3B3BQ|5|Love it! Looks great on my truck and an easy install.
B001UGNJ60|4|Seems to be working to reduce the amount of wiggle in the camper.  Doesn't eliminate it completely. I installed 2 sets, since the trailer is 29 feet long. I think they work better when the jacks are not all the way extended, so blocks help with that.
B001C4SLOU|1|Doesn't fit 2015 Ford Escape 2.0L even though it says it does.
B000IYXKBO|5|Quality part! Worked well on 2004 trail blazer.
B009FICRWM|4|nice color just what I wanted I hope the 3m sticker stay on. FYI MY Plate on had only two hole for plate holder ,,Just a thoght for you to put small screwsdifferent size for bottom with plastic  nuts so not to scracth the bottom paint . .I modify with plastic caps small screws best I can..love the stars
B007ZGE7MO|5|These fit perfect and created a great protective barrier.
B009TC7BLG|5|great product
B004MXN71U|5|the problem in our RV is fixed
B00C0SQAZ4|5|Great deal
B00ATXEPQI|5|Something less poking out of the dash
B005BNP7Z4|3|not bright enough
B008OAFYWC|5|Very handy
B00AMPJ68U|1|I installed the new ones and noticed the tailgate would only open hafe way.  The new ones were 21 inches long but the originals were 24 inches long and turns out they are the wrong ones?
B004J0Z1BU|5|nice
B000CAAVA2|5|Nice
B00F0CIO60|5|Its a grounding strap, It conducts electricity, helps ward off grounding gremlins.<br />It looks like it does in the picture.
B008HZPCQW|5|I just took a road trip after installing these and they performed flawlessly! I also installed BOSCH rotors and I must say I couldn't be more satisfied. To be honest, I found that I actually could have gotten away with just replacing my pads as my rotors had next to no wear on them at over 123K miles - chalk it up to TOYOTA quality - but I went ahead and replaced both and saved my OEM rotors for possible future use. Anyways ... these won't disappoint you and they perform to BOSCH's high quality standards I've grown to know over the years.
B000CAXHLW|5|Fits perfectly onto my Infiniti 2002 G20. Good printing on the belt, the groves were the right size, and right away the squealing noise went away. I like how inexpensive the belt was and that the size was right on the money.
B002UZUCDS|5|Works great
B0016KFXR8|3|Its a hitch ball.  One of my biggest complaints is that this is not a self locking hitch ball (WHICH IS THE REASON I BOUGHT IT) - You need two people to put this on easily or the right tools to do it yourself.  I needed two wrenches at the end of the day.  I was a little frustrated.
B001NYYREC|5|Worked perfectly for my 2014 Chevy Silverado 1500 WT.  Took about one minute to install from start to finish.  Great product; great price; fast shipping!
B002UX7I9G|3|meh. The light seems to be not as warm the bulbs it replaces. It seems a little greenish, versus the yellow from before. In terms of light output I don't see a difference. I got the car old, so maybe the previous owner already installed &#34;super bright&#34; lights, but frankly there is just not enough light. Sense are clean, mirror is good... voltage is right.... And by the way, the law restricts the amount of light a headlight can put out, so I don't have much hope there is something out there that can make more light with halogen bulbs. I'll just drive in the dark and hope for the best :)
B003NBQN72|3|I would have given this 5 stars but the passenger front seat matt did not have a hole for the hook, so there is a gap between the floorboad and the mat as thr passenger side has a hook. Whats odd is the drivers side matt did have hole perforated for the hook, so why not the passenger mat? All in all the product arrived well packaged and the quality is good, aside from the continuity defect.
B0002JN3GC|5|a few months back I replaced my windshield wipers with these and they work great! I have had no problems what so ever with these. Super easy to put on also. Its been about 4-6 months now and they are still holding up so that's great. Makes me feel like I got my moneys worth. I would buy again.
B000FPYHOU|1|Not even close to the specs listed in the item description....this is much smaller and heavier. Listed at .3 ounces, actual is 1.3 ounces. Listed at 5.9 x 3.5 x 0.2 inches, actual is 3.5 x 1.75 x .65 inches
B010KMMM4E|5|Much darker than the picture, but managed to perfectly match my helmet and the vinyl wrap I purchased prior to this order. Also, two day shipping? Awesome.
B0090IRKUG|5|Quick, Easy, Safe, are just some of the words to describe Nanoskin clay pads. Works great with the Porter Cable 7424 XP and any quick detailer. While it doesn't completely replace the traditional clay bar, this product will save you so much time detailing your car.
B000F10QXU|5|love love it
B004P4GYZ2|5|Worked great. It's a little smaller then the stock one but bolted up fine.
B0009JKI6S|1|Very streaky.
B008NYL80G|2|I do use my radio a lot so i don't like how the stations were frequently static-y.<br />But it looks nice ;)
B00L9G2F7K|3|Would have given it a 5 star rating but, they sent me the wrong one. I ordered the regular matte black and received the distressed matte black, which does match the one I bought for my hood. The quality of their decals is awesome and goes on easy. So far seems to stick really well.
B001J8M80C|5|These are high quality mats from BMW (not an aftermarket product).  They were promptly shipped from Iowa. They look great and fit perfectly (I have a 2004 325iT).  The floor anchor pins that come with the mats work well. I agree with one of the other reviewers: I should have bought these long ago after my carpeted mats wore out.  Recommended!
B004H9RK76|5|great cruising sticker
B00AVYGEJG|5|Looks much better than stock & works great!
B000RN2AHQ|2|Purchased it for my 2011 cbr 600rr not even considering my tank is plastic, so I have no used for the bag.<br />It's a great size though and would have been quite convenient to have. But I took a loss on it and sold it to my buddy for less than I paid.<br />Much less of a hassle than returning it.
B000CCBMEE|5|very nice
B00HFN7JU4|3|Mirror installed easily enough but it vibrates ass we are driving. Hard to look in the mirror for lane clearance when everything is all jittery.
B00PT18QAQ|5|I don't have much experience with tire pressure gauges but I found this easy to use, it is easy to handle with the black plastic/rubber around the dial and you can swivel it to read the dial. It is good as it holds the reading after it is taken off the tire. I haven't used the function to decrease tire pressure with the pressure bleed button, but that would come handy if I overfilled the tire. I bought this gauge instead of a digital one so I don't have to change the battery.
B00PMXS7SM|4|Quite bright and good color.  They do tend to &#34;hot spot&#34; more than a bulb if there isn't much distance from the bulb to the diffuser.  Hard to beat the price.
B00B9D2TBK|5|fit right and looks like the original one on the other side
B00OP5R74I|1|This thing is garbage. Fits very loose by one tiny little screw broke first day don't waste your money
B00EECM5FI|4|Great customer service, Good quality
B007FGGVFK|5|Just received and everything looks good. Fast delivery will comment back once I get them installed.
B00EO1F9I4|2|Wire was useless
B003VGHB9I|5|perfect fit at a fair price
B00HZVWJVA|5|Great product. Fits pretty well. Make sure you have a good painter. Screwed up first try and had to buy more 3m tape. Pain in the but to remove. Looks great on the car though.
B0001EWQXO|4|Not quite the right size for the window it was designed for G30 Van but otherwise decent though using 2 sided tape is asking to have to re apply it down the road. Injection molded so having a lip that slides down over the top edge of the door is not difficult nor would it add to the cost. A little re engineering and it could be perfect.
