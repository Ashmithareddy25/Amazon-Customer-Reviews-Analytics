B00C8S9W0G|5|This whole series of 8 books is a fantastic read!  I just read the whole series together and was very sad to have finished it!
0765376679|5|Just a fantastic fantasy book, worth the read and time it takes. Great characters, incredible storyline. Just bah, read it now.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Fast action and lots of different games. I always run out of lives before I'm tired of playing. It's fun when you beat your friends score; also, sending them lives and other helps.
B00CHVJODE|5|My entire family (the old man, 3 year old boy, and our parents) all enjoyed this movie. Very funny!!!! It is great for family night, we all laughed our butts off!

B007KAJG3K|4|I love the take on this version of Sherlock Holmes!<br />And also love the interplay Holmes and Sherlock.<br />Gave this only four stars because they killed off the female lead from the last film!<br />I adored her, and her scenes though brief in this film were simply delicious!
B00VFTA70I|4|Good movie
B00EE3FVSU|5|Very interesting and complex plot :look for more pike thus.
B000FBFN1U|4|everyone dies
B000AA4JMU|5|This has been one of my favorite movies since it came out.  The actors are great, the hmusic and dancing are wonderful, and you can't top Charles Dickens as an author.  After I've watched it, I go around humming the tunes the rest of the day.
B00E9A656K|3|This is a nice game.<br />It's good for drag racing. The bad thing is you CAN'T drift in this game.

B008Y2FRFO|5|fun app --- not much skill involved. strangely addictive.<br />better than wasting money in the arcade and it 's free. get it.
B00957T6X6|5|if you like the tv shows you will love the books, I could never put them down. I was engrossed with the characters and stories, my life for the last few months has been nothing but changing attitudes because of what's going on in these books.
081297381X|5|I really enjoy reading NNT's books. Although it's not a prerequisite, I'm glad I read &#34;Fooled by Randomness&#34; first.
B0099Y2YL6|5|Nevermind the superb casting and performances rendered by a stellar cast,  the setting, sets, costumes and props are a visual feast for the eyes!  Fellows has created a storyline and characters that rival the best of the recent Jane Austen award-winning films.
0743455967|5|I was totally smitten by the writing of Stephen King in this book, and wanted to read more of his work.  I'd never read him before, and was compelled to find a title I could tolerate. I'm not into blood and guts or eeriness or weirdness - but I truly admire King's use of language and his ability to create characters and the consistency of plotting he discusses in On Writing. It's so simple, but \\"What would happen if...\\" is a fine hook! I'm now deeply enjoying The Dome, but I can't imagine reading it again. Once I know the answer, that'll be that.<br /><br />I hope one of these days he abandons his usual stripes, and writes The Great American Novel. He's got what it takes to produce something that benefits from many runs through, like Jane Austen, say, where what happens is secondary to the characters.  I'm ready, and so is he!<br /><br />I may well re-read On Writing, though. There's a lot of meat, and brilliantly presented, in that little book.
0440219078|4|This book was one of my favorite books.  It kept me on the edge of my seat  the whole way through.   It is about a boy and what happens to him when he  receives the most important job in the tower.   If I recommend any book it  would be this one.
B000092ZYX|5|If you like Coldplay and you like red hot chilipeppers, you will love Radioheads newest album: Hail to the thief..<br />After I bought the cd, It has been continiously played..<BR>Track 7: There there, is amazing....

B00B0LPWU6|4|Denzel is awesome! It is terrifying to think your pilot could be drunk or on drugs. Loved the scary reality of it.
B00BMKDTNC|5|It's the last book.  I am not going to give a series that i have spent the last 10 years of my life reading anything less than five stars.  I don't even know why I am leaving a review, by this point you already know whether or not you are going to be buying this book.
B00006RCNW|5|You know a show is great when too many people 'dispise' it &amp; that's what happened with the finest episodic tv show ever, &quot;The Shield'!!<br /> Sure a 'few' liberties are in the writng of &quot;The Shield&quot; but it's the closest thing you'll ever see on tv to the realities of both life on the street of an inner city, &amp; the way REAL POLICE get necessary things done. BRAVO.<br /> I live in this 'type' of environment &amp; 'know' detecives just like those that appear in &quot;The Shield&quot;. Most people won't admit to the reality this show brings out, but that's the way it is.<br /> Reality TV is a joke, &quot;The Shield&quot; is closer to reality than ANY show on television, but critic's &amp; 'tv watchdogs' &amp; most viewers don't want to face a &quot;REAL&quot; tv show. This IS reality tv folks. Deal with it &amp; enjoy it like I do.<br /> I must give some credit to the &quot;tv censors&quot; for allowing the language &amp; violence that &quot;The Shield&quot; portrays(to keep it as real to life as tv will allow) because this 'fictional' tv show gives you what the reality tv  show &quot;COPS&quot; is 'supposed' to but doesn't.<br /> Where &quot;NYPD BLUE&quot;(which I still enjoy, &amp; is close to reality)tried to break in the door of what is accessible for adult tv viewers, &quot;The Sheild&quot; blew the doors off it's hinges and should be applauded &amp; recognized for it honesty, &amp; fine performances &amp; writing!<br /> Frankly, after watching Shawn Ryan's 'hokey' tv effort &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; I had no faith in a new 'cop show' with his name attached, but like all great artists Ryan has a 'dark' side to him &amp; we now get the pleasure of watching special tv when viewing &quot;The Shield&quot;! <br />NO IT'S NOT FOR CHILDREN, or for adult viewer's with the mentality of a child, but that what's so great about this series, it's complicated &amp; deals with ADULT issue's and dare I say therefore it probably won't survive the 3rd season.Sigh. <br /> I say this because the 2nd season outshined it's premier, &amp; should Ryan &amp; Chiklis(et al)try &amp; push the 'tv boundries'even further in the 3rd season, the people with power will likely crush this great show. Sadly most great things are limited, &amp; not appreciated until they are gone(painters/writers/musicians/ect)but HOPEFULLY<BR>the stark genius of this show will survive &amp; i'll have at least 1 hr of GREAT tv to look forward to each week. Sadly writing &amp; acting of this caliber cannot sustain more than a few weeks out of each year, but I can't wait until March rolls around!<br /> Thank you Shawn Ryan-Michael Chiklis-CCH Pounder, hell everyone<BR>that is involved with the creation of this fantastic show! It proves you don't 'have to go to' the movies for a magical moment<BR>but in all likelyhood it's greatness spells doom for futher sucess.
0679746048|3|The book Girl Interrupted is a book that is very different from the rest.  The main character, Lisa, is an eighteen-year old girl, who has a very complex mind.  She was hospitalized for eighteen months during the sixties for a borderline personality disorder.  The author had really descriptive and realistic details about what Lisa was going through.  Then closer to the end of the book when Lisa was getting much better the author starting picking up the pace of the book slowly.  If you would like to read this book and understand it and really like this you should really be interested in psychology and how the minds of others work.  If your not then you might not understand this book and you would find it confusing and pointless.  This book is very peculiar and unique because not to many books tell about what goes on in other peoples minds, especially minds that are in need of psychiatric help.  <BR>     The author used a very casual type of language and a lot of street language and swearing.  Her style of writing is different too because the book started out real slow and told millions of details about every little thing.   Then the pace started to pick up once you were getting into the meat of the book.   At the end of the book she was flying through the rest of her life after she got out of the hospital.  About 7 out of 10 people liked this book that I saw on other posted reviews.  I personally found it to be an all right book.  It interested me to know what was going on in that persons mind because her mind thought a little different than the average persons' mind.  It wasn't my favorite because I didn't like certain parts of the book where the author would talk about things that you really didn't have to know.  This book was interesting and confusing at the same time but it was worth reading once!
B004SJ3BCI|3|My six year likes it!
B000QCQ8Y4|4|Bad Luck and Trouble is one of the best Jack Reacher stories you will find.  Reacher has never been more complex, nuanced, and human.  Bad Luck and Trouble sees Jack reuniting with his old Army colleagues, and the team approach serves to really capture the essence of his character, helping us understand Jack's captivating sense of loyalty, duty, and honor. The action and pace are superb, but the vivid characters are what really stand out, helping make Bad Luck and Trouble a must read for Reacher fans.
B005OP2928|5|This is one of my favorite shows on t.v. right now.  It illustrates the diverse personalities within a family, and the different types of families that one can have.  The families all love and care about one another.  There are sometimes problems, arguments, or differences between family members, but it all seems to work out with humor and grace.  I would highly recommend this show.
6305922756|5|Long before \\"A Mighty Wind,\\" \\"Best In Show,\\" and \\"Waiting For Guffman,\\" Christopher Guest was best known for his work in \\"This is Spinal Tap.\\"  Though, Guest did not direct this mockumentary---or \\"rockumentary,\\" if you will, he is brilliant, and wrote this film (along with writing the ORIGINAL rock and roll music) with the wonderful team of Michael Mckean, Harry Shearer and director Rob Reiner.  Incidentally, McKean and Shearer went on to appear with Guest on Saturday Night Live, in the early 1980s, as well as \\"Best in Show\\" and \\"A Mighty Wind\\" (two of the mockumentary/improv trilogies conceptualized by Guest and fellow comedian Eugene Levy).<br /><br />David St. Hubbins (Michael Mckean), Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest) and Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer) are the trio that make up the fading British heavy metal band, Spinal Tap, chronicled by filmmaker Marty DiBergi (Rob Reiner), and we watch their journey, as they gradually spiral downward into obscurity.  But, let me tell you, it is one hell of a ride.  You are going to laugh so hard, as the actors manage to retain their overaccentuated British accents, over-the-top rock star eccentricities and belt out songs like \\"Big Bottom\\" and \\"Hell Hole.\\"  It just goes to show that everyone is entitled to their fifteen minutes of fame (in the words of Andy Warhol).<br /><br />A special bonus, on this DVD, is its wonderful outtakes and feature interviews and previously unreleased music videos.  Spinal Tap actually toured in the 1980s to actual roaring crowds!  Be sure to stick around for the extra footage.  It's quite amusing......
B008NCSZQ8|5|This is one of my favorite movies, Marvel did an excellent job making this film
B00CXQL828|5|Even though I am a Sheehan and Portnoy fan, I never had much left for Kotzen. His contribution to Mr. Big and Poison wasn't really my thing.<br />I must say I am very positively surprised by this album. Good strong songs, good singing by Mr. Kotzen, nice solos, it's an excellent album for when driving.
B00RL9UZGW|3|Movie built slowly in character development and plot. If you hang in there for the first<br />Thirty minutes, I believe you will enjoy the storyline. It is not Denzel's most memorable roll,but it does offer<br />entertainment and good action sequences.

0790749815|5|This is arguably Cary Grants best film. Couple that with a terrific cast, dynamite story, immortal one-liners, some great scenes in actual locations, and classic Hitchcock editing and you have a shoe-in on any &quot;best of all time list&quot;. This movie was made in 1958 and although it was current in it's day, it now is just as current as a period film set in 1958, keeping in mind of the political climate and cold war attitudes of the time. The costumes are very natural, having been bought in actual New York stores, and the set designs are beautifully designed. The set decoration is also first rate. <br />This DVD is a superb transfer. The color looks perfectly natural, the sound is full, low noise stereo and the widescreen is anamorphic. There is hardly any flaw in the print. Amazing. The menu is also animated to match the Saul Bass opening title and is wonderful. The &quot;making of&quot; film (30 minutes long) is superb and hosted by beautiful leading lady &quot;Eve Marie Saint&quot;. <br />Finally, the score by Bernard Hermann adds to the high tension of the action. The orchestration and performance on this film is one of the very best of all time. I can't recommend this film enough for action, solid story and terrific action besides just being completely entertaining.
B00BEJL6JK|5|Bloody but so were the Romans of old.

B003XKPPOU|5|\\"Toy Story\\" was about sibling rivalry. \\"Toy Story 2\\" was about loving others, even if it means you might get hurt someday.<br /><br />So what is \\"Toy Story 3\\" about? It takes the whole \\"kids + loyal toys\\" theme to its natural conclusion, by showing us what happens when the kids grow up and leave. While the first two-thirds of the movie are fairly pedestrian (for a Pixar movie!), the last part is both action-packed and emotionally wrenching.<br /><br />Ten years have passed, and Andy is now a college-bound teenager. His toys are anxious about what's going to happen, so Woody keeps assuring them that they'll be put safely in the attic. But a misunderstanding leads to a date with the garbage truck. Since the toys believe they have been abandoned, they jump into the box of donated toys bound for Sunnyside Daycare.<br /><br />They're greeted by the genial Lots-o'-Hugging Bear (aka Lotso) and the friendly daycare toys, and all seems to be well. But Andy's toys soon discover that Sunnyside is a nighmare -- they've been assigned the \\"Caterpillar Room\\" for wild abusive toddlers, and Lotso is the Godfatheresque overlord of the daycare. Once Woody learns the true horrors of Sunnyside, he must infiltrate the daycare and somehow get his friends out.<br /><br />You know that the movie industry is officially in a slump when the cleverest, funniest and most touching movie of the summer... is a CGI sequel about toys. \\"Toy Story 3\\" starts off rather lightweight at first, with the toys being brought into Sunnyside and Woody setting off in another direction.<br /><br />But once Lotso is revealed as the villain, the movie takes a sharp turn -- it becomes a clever, complex \\"Great Escape\\"-style caper, with some moments of G-rated horror (THE MONKEY!) and hilarity (resetting Buzz ends up turning him into a flamenco-dancing suave Spaniard). And while the toys' attempted escape from Sunnyside is taut and genuinely thrilling, it's only the START of the climax -- a harrowing, genuinely scary chase scene that brings the toys together.<br /><br />And there's a bittersweet core to \\"Toy Story 3\\": kids grow up, leave home and the people/toys they leave behind are both proud and sad. In the final scenes of the movie,we're quietly ushered through the emotional goodbyes and hellos of growing up.<br /><br />And the adorable little cast of toys still remind us that what matters most is love and loyalty, particularly during a deadly crisis where they all fearfully join hands (it sounds sappy, but it isn't). There's also some endearing additions to the cast -- the foppish clotheshorse Ken, Big Baby, a Totoro, a giggly tricerotops, and the Shakespearean stuffed hedgehog Mr. Pricklepants.<br /><br />Anyway, this blu-ray/DVD combo has a wealth of extras -- trailers teasers, theatrical shorts (oh look, Night and Day are scuffling!), \\"Cine-emplore,\\" commentary, lots of making-ofs, behind the scenes stuff like \\"A Toy's Eye View: Creating A Whole New Land,\\" a music video, and just lots of endearing odds and ends like Ken's dating tips. Er...<br /><br />It hurts to say goodbye to Woody, Buzz and their friends, but \\"Toy Story 3\\" is a fitting farewell that brings the trilogy full circle. Best movie of the summer, hands down.ether.     And there's a bittersweet core to \\"Toy Story 3\\": kids grow up, leave home and the people/toys they leave behind are both proud and sad.

0375847227|5|Came quickly. Product exactly as desribed. Turned out my daughter did care if she got the book or not, but that's not your fault! oh well, I am enjoying the story again...this book feels great in the hands!

B00DPM7TIG|4|Interesting premise .
B0071XO8RA|5|I don't read crap Science Fiction.  I read, Asimov, Herbert, Card, Simmons, etc.  I just finished Wool Omnibus Edition, by Hugh Howey and I've added Mr. Howey to the list of authors who I will always follow.  I have get Wool 6 & 7, First and Second Shift respectively, on my Kindle ASAP!  While reading Wool, I have to force myself to not jump ahead in order to release the tension regarding what is about to happen to one of Mr. Howey's characters.  I find ways to identify with the characters, even the villains, that make them feel real and very human.  No one dimensional characters here, even the ones you barely get to know.<br /><br />I'm not prone to take the time to write reviews, but I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the Wool experience, and thus had to share my delight.<br /><br />EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT!!
B004XJRQUQ|5|I've enjoyed the movies so far but reading the books definitely fills in the spots. I would recommend to anyone! I had no issues with formatting.  I viewed this book on my Samsung galaxy 4 and on my Kindle fire and had zero issues.
B0085YOD1A|5|This is a very useful tool, considering I spend most of my time outside or on the road right now, so I NEED to know just how fast I'm running out of battery life.
B00003CXRM|5|I was pretty reluctant to watch &quot;O Brother&quot; in the first place, after being recommended to it from a friend. After i saw the movie however, i was SOOO satisifed. I absolutely LOVED this movie and i would recommend it to anyone. George Clooney is great as Everett and his comrads Pete and Delmar become instantly lovable by viewers of all ages. Not only is the movie funny, but it pulls of Homer's Odyssey like i never thought possilbe! This is truly a great film.
B00BAXFECK|4|I've loved all of Tartt's books so far and The Goldfinch is a worthy successor to The Secret History and The Little Friend, although not so tortured. It's a coming-of-age story with all that entails, and a good one. Tartt's characters are unforgettable and true to life. The painting in question is intriguing, and her fictionalized tale parallels its showing in NY, interesting coincidence.
B006LSZECO|3|It was just ok.  Did not see what all the hype was about.
0062255657|5|Very rarely does a book so clearly capture the memory of childhood as it was, and not as it was imagined. This book is precious in its painfulness, and much of it is no surprise to Gaiman readers. It is a familiar patchwork of the fantastic and the mundane, both given equal importance, and both of these elements are fleeting. The content here is unflinching, sometimes very violent, and often strikingly clear to the reader even when it is filtered through the perspective of a young child. If 'Coraline' has been a story of childhood horror for children, 'Ocean' is more firmly a story of childhood's horrors revisited after the fact. I love it fiercely.
B0045HCJ94|5|This film is not only the famous couple's best film together, it is their best film individually as well. Watching the film more than once is suggested; the supurb poetry of the dialogue and monologues and the way they link together throughout the film are not to be missed.
0679882820|5|Adorable book for a toddler. My 2-year old loves it!
B008673ZAQ|3|I loved Bared to You, so I was highly anticipating Reflected in You. There were things I loved about this story, unfortunately the things that frustrated me far outweighed those.<br /><br />We pick up the Eva and Gideon's intense story right where we left off in Bared to You. They've got past some of the Corinne drama, are seeing a therapist jointly due to their abusive pasts, and settled in for the long haul. Or so we think. From the get go we have possessive and controlling behavior on both sides. They both seem to thrive on it. Eva and Gideon are not confident in each other unless they've pushed the other one to make some over-the-top gesture to control, and consume one another. But let's face it, we/I sort of love this, to a certain extent.<br /><br />I can't complain about 50% of the book because it was HOT and wonderful. Ms. Day really knows how to write some steam, and boy does she excel at getting you hot and bothered. And I'm not just talking about the spice. It's the push and pull between Eva and Gideon and their overwhelming desire for one another. I have many delicious quotes and scenes highlighted in my Kindle that are sure to make anyone's toes curl! Here's a sample:<br /><br />I found myself pinned to the hallway wall by six feet, two inches of hard, hot male. \\"You know what happens when you run, angel.\\" Gideon nipped my lower lip with his teeth and then soothed the sting with the caress of his tongue. \\"I catch you.\\"<br /><br />I would've been fine with this situation had Gideon been more forthcoming. Didn't we all finish Bared to You thinking we're going to get answers about his past and behavior in this one? I know I did. Eva freely trusted and shared her past with him. I don't know why he felt the need to hold back so much. Instead we get pages and pages of frustration, and behavior that infuriates with no explanation! Not even at the 80% mark were there answers! I was about to pull my hair out! Add to that is Corinne! Gideon knows what Corinne does to Eva:<br /><br />Gideon: \\"I thought I understood your feelings for Corinne, and, frankly, I thought you just weren't dealing with it well. But I had no clue. I was a self-centered idiot.\\" Eva: \\"I'm not dealing with it well. I hate her effing (substitution) guts. I can't think about her without feeling violent. \\" Gideon: \\"I get it now. I didn't before.\\"<br /><br />He GETS it because Eva turns the table on him with jealousy and he gets a taste of his own medicine. But does this stop the Corinne issue? NO!!!!!!!!! All we get is: \\"Trust me Eva.\\" When all I wanted to do was SHANK him at this point! Okay, okay, I'll calm down.....this is fiction after all. So basically I was frustrated for about 40-50% of this book. I can take 20-30% of frustration, I expect it. We must have some hurdle to overcome. But when the frustration and confusion are for almost half of the book, I start getting ticked. I feel like the author is jacking me around. If Eva was enlightened, given a little clue, a breadcrumb, just a little bit before we hit the the 94% mark, I would've been happy. We still didn't even get the full story until almost the last pages!!! In my opinion, this was completely unnecessary! Yes, I know, I am seriously ranty and harpy in this review. Sorry. I finished this story last night and was totally worked up, and woke up even more worked up, and went through the day in a foul mood because I COULDN'T GET THIS STORY OUT OF MY HEAD! This review is the result of that aggravation, I had to vent somewhere. You are my collateral damage.<br /><br />I will say, I'm dying for the next installment and probably will pick it up the day it comes out. Is that all kinds of crazy? Maybe......probably. Maybe this is a testament of what a great job Ms. Day did in writing this story. Or maybe she's just an evil genius, and I'm like a moth to the flame.<br /><br />Thank you to Penguin Group and Netgalley for allowing me to read this.
B002G1YPH0|5|In my opinion (I have built PCs for about 15 years) this is the best price to value aftermarket cooler you can buy. I would not hesitate at all.<br /><br />I currently have my personal PC oc'ed to 4.9 and my temps are at (wait a sec let me check with the RealTemp XS bench) 37C on the hottest core!!<br /><br />Normal working temps are around 27C to 32C.<br /><br />I believe that anyone who claims this doesn't work has no idea what is going on. I have installed many of these coolers and they rock. BUY IT&#62;
B00B5HQLMI|5|great movie - lots of action. cannot wait until the next one! daniel craig is the real deal and a great 007
6303567126|5|Writers' lives aren't always easy, as this film represents in all its realism and unashamed detail of life on the streets and conflict with drugs and sex. I study this film to see how I can help those who are lost in all  aspects of life. Leo is great. This is one of those films not fit for all  tastes.
B009ZQ8FQG|5|My wife and I watched all three seasons in about a month.  We really enjoyed the story and the history behind the story.  Althought we are hoping that Dan Stevens will return to the show. I know the finale pretty much finished him off, but one can hope.
1451608659|5|i love this book. such a great read. i remember watching dominique when i was a small girl so when i herd she had a book out about her life i bought it. i usually don't buy memoir books i find them for the most part pretty boring. but this one draws you in right from the start.
B007V5CF5K|5|I loved the game I had it on my moms phone and I loved loved it I beged my mom to let me get it on my kindel first time trying it on mtly kindle fir hoop it works
B00AHSIQWE|3|A pretty good sequel with good acting and excellent special effects. Christian Bale again gives a terrific performance as Batman.  Ms. Hathaway is also very good. The rest of the cast does a fine job especially Marion Cotillard. For me the film is just too darn long and at times seems to become some what repetitious. It needed better editing. I also got a little tired of the villain continually beating,  strangling and breaking the neck of everyone he meets. This villain is a one dimensional character if there every was one. This film really needed another villain like the Joker played by the late Heath Ledger. I know this is a cartonish movie but the ending was too ludicrous. Still if you like losts of action and enjoy top quality special effects this is a movie for you.
B001ANYDAO|4|My name is Horane Williams and I am a University of Baltimore student enrolled in the survey Entrepreneurship course, teached by Professor Ratinho Oliveira,Tiago and that this particular book was my recommended recommended reading. Outliers, written by Malcolm Gladwell deals with the cultural and society factors that allow determined individuals to reach their goals by opportunities that arise as time gradually goes on. Gladwell examines that the known successful and wealthy people are where they are due to extraordinary opportunities. Gladwell defines an outlier as a person out of the ordinary “who doesn't fit into our normal understanding of achievement.” In Outliers, Gladwell takes a different approach to how we view success. Gladwell shows us that maybe sometimes people are more successful than others at a particular time because of the generation they are born in and the expectation of that specific generation. What I like most about this book is the section where Gladwell took a look at the history of Bill Gates. He examined and determined that Bill Gates was an outlier. Bill Gates took an opportunity with using computers; with the help of 10,000 hours of focused hard work it led him to the next point of his career. At times it was hard for me to transition to another case study. For example, if Gladwell would of ran with the history of Bill Gates and maybe throw in small facts of other celebrities that would have been fine but other case studies was used which sometimes got confusing. Other entrepreneurship students could value from this book by using the concepts Gladwell applied in his text of how determinants of success are based on timing, and being persistence, when determining to launch a new business venture.
B001HN694K|5|I love this movie
B004S5C8WG|3|Good but credibility of story questionable.
B00BAXFECK|5|No wonder it got the award. I will be reading it again and again.it is so worth it's price in GOLD.
0783240503|4|This is a wonderful video to own. The stage production can not be duplicated, but this is the next best thing. It is much better than some of the brainless movies so readily available. Get this video and revel in the  great music and excellent performance by Donny Osmond, he is wonderful. I'm  sending a copy to both my daughters!
B00H71PBQ8|5|Love this show!  Wish there were more shows like this on tv!
B00005JMUA|1|What a letdown. After months of waiting, we're left with a drawn-out, badly written, undercharacterised anticlimax. The action scenes are poor, the plot developments predictable, the characters uninteresting and even QT's supposedly legendary ear for dialogue is revealed to be made of solid tin - was there ever a worse last line for a major movie? And were there ever so many poor performances in one film from a supposedly major director? Carradine shines only because he rises to the giddy heights of being average in such poor company (Uma is especially bad, and the extremely unflattering photography doesn't help). <br /> <br />KB 1 was an okayish but wildly overlong actioner, but there's nothing here to match the silly but mildly exciting House of Blue Leaves finale. What that means is the big action climax actually happened at the end of another movie or halfway through this one when it's put together. After that, imagination deserts QT, but he just keeps on going like an irritating tin toy that has outstayed its welcome. A poor show, for purists and geeks only. THE disappointment of the decade.
B00U2WORPA|3|I found the opening of the book to be contrived, requiring a kind of suspended disbelief and unearned buy in right away.  The sudden start without a sense of history made the initial sexual scene between the 2 main characters lack emotional tension... for me.  There were other elements of the book that were enjoyable enough, if formulaic.  Perhaps Jeremy's ambivalence about submitting to Owen is the most interesting emotional string to follow in the book.  I suppose I'll try #2 when it arrives and see if there's anything more unique and interesting in it.
B001DSNF8C|5|Despite the recent success of Skyfall (probably 2nd best Bond film), I still believe Casino Royale has the best acting, story, action, drama, etc of all the Bond films.  A must own for Bond-lovers, and movie-lovers!
B00127RAJY|4|I like the overall workout and the combining of aerobics, strength and abs.  Twenty minutes of intensity will get you the results you want. However, I have one complaint.  In workout 2, there is an exercise where you go down in plank form and do a sort of jumping jack from this position. I have been working out with aerobics and weight training for over 25 years, so I'm overall fit.  This move puts way too much weight on the small calf muscles/tendons running up back of your calf and I know this because I ended up pulling this muscle tonight with  this move.  The tops of your toes is not a stable enough base to support this move and you run the risk of injuring yourself like I did.<br />Form is very important in weight training and in aerobics.  I would nix this move.
B000VYX8PE|5|I loved how it's not your average story and just when your happy for the three children something unexpected happens. This is a very good book if your looking for ironic examples.
B00T3DNKIE|5|Wonderful book.
B00006DEFA|4|After not having seen \\"Amadeus\\" for many years, I impulsively bought the director's cut edition which was on sale at the local wholesale club. It is everything I remember about it. <br /> <br />First the good... <br /> <br />The score is wonderful! As noted in the bonus materials, the music - all Mozart's and not adapted - actually becomes another character in the movie. It's glorious! Milos Forman also made the conscious decision to use a variety of Mozart's music and not just a few familiar pieces and it adds immeasurably to the enjoyment of the movie. Of course, the other can work well as well - e.g. \\"Elvira Madigan\\", where Mozart's 21st piano concerto became \\"the Elvira Madigan theme\\". <br /> <br />The direction and cinematography are gorgeous and impeccable. This is a beautifully-crafted film which invokes a great sense of time and place. <br /> <br />Now for the bad... <br /> <br />The myth of Salieri's murder or attempted murder has been around since the time of Mozart. It's the sort of juicy story that just develops a life of its own, despite all evidence to the contrary. It's unfortunate that it has been perpetuated by so many - from Mozart's time to Pushkin to Shaffer. <br /> <br />Mozart's portrayal as childish and vulgar is inaccurate. He had a sense of humor and fun. Sometimes his sense of humor was vulgar in interaction with those closest to him, but he certainly knew how to conduct himself as a professional in public. In the movie, he is depicted as both immoral and an alcoholic toward the end of his life. Affairs have been speculated, but almost anyone who draws public attention has to endure such speculation, true or not. In Mozart's case, there is no serious evidence to back up the gossip. Certainly, he was not a drunkard! Also, although he was certainly not wise in his handling of his financial affairs, he was just as surely not without students and lived quite comfortably for most of his adult life. <br /> <br />Salieri's portrayal as a mediocrecomposer is also wrong. Salieri was certainly in the shadow of Mozart, but he was a talented composer of mostly operas (unlike Mozart, Salieri rarely composed instrumental music). Had Mozart not lived at the same time, Salieri would certainly have been better known, but then the same could be said of almost every contemporary composer. It's worth noting that Salieri's students included Beethoven and Liszt. <br /> <br />Costanze's portrayal is closer to the truth, but still misses the mark. By all accounts, she was a devoted wife and Mozart was devoted to her. She certainly did not leave for \\"the spa\\" when he was sick. The backstory of her as the daughter of Mozart's landlady ignores the fact that she was the younger sister of a girl Mozart had wanted to marry when he and his mother were in Paris. The older sister eventually became famous as a prima donna and spurned him. Mozart remained in good terms with the family and was boarding with them in Vienna when he and Costantze developed into a couple. Leopold Mozart was opposed to the marriage mostly because the family had a reputation for what we would call a Bohemian lifestyle. <br /> <br />Leopold Mozart's portrayal is more accurate, but then his isn't a fleshed-out character in the show. Leopold's relationship with his son was complex and, after the death of Mozart's mother, increasingly strained. The motives imputed to him by the script are not only wrong, but over-simplified. One thing we do know for sure is that it was not Salieri that commissioned the requiem mass. Count Walsegg-Stuppach was the mysterious \\"man in gray\\" who intended to pass the work off as his own. <br /> <br />While I enjoyed the movie enough to give it an 4 rating, it's unconscionable to think that many people may accept its slanders as truth.
B00687Q0VC|4|seemed to be pretty factual... I learned some things I didn't know
B007PVHANM|5|Great documentary of the life of Bob Marley. You don't have to be into Reggae or Marley to enjoy this film.
B000005E3K|4|I will only listen to Baroque music performed on authentic instruments.  In my opinion, the music demands the proper instruments in order to be truly heard.  Mozart, however, along with other composers of the Classical era, is perfectly acceptable on modern instruments to my ear, as long as they play like the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields.  Les Arts Florissants is not a modern orchestra, though.  They are clearly playing on what are supposed to be properly constructed instruments for Mozart's day.  I don't mind the difference at all.<br /><br />Considering that I suffered many years with a recording that became increasingly intolerable due to its lack of originality and fire, the crisp, thin texture of ancient strings, as well as the combination of women's and boys' voices in the choir, is refreshing and new (to me, anyway).<br /><br />One of the nicest things about authentic early music ensembles is that the brass are not constructed to play as loudly as modern brass, so that the orchestra as a whole does not need to hold back.  The choir can belt it out (and they do) while the orchestra goes for greater vigor in the louder, faster passages like the Dies Irae and Confutatis.  In the latter, I prefer to hear only men's and boys' voices, and on this recording, there are women as well, but it is a criticism hardly worth mentioning.  Just listen to these expert singers handle the melismas in the faster tempos.<br /><br />And Christie really pushes the tempos here.  This doesn't sound like those austere, all-too-proper readings of Mozart's music.  Incisive brass, archi con fuoco, even a timpani that shocks you with its ferocity.  I would love to hear him turned loose on some of Mozart's symphonies.  Perhaps sometime in the future, no?
B004KKXMSI|4|THANKS
B00C7TAF3Y|5|I loved this game!  Yes, it's a quick play, but that's probably because I couldn't put it down.  The graphics are great, the puzzles were challenging, the storyline is interesting, and some of the music is just plain creepy.  After I finished it, I played it again!!!
B0067R0APK|5|A must have app for anyone and everyone. If you spend most of your time outside working, or having fun its a must have. Great, in depth weather reports, as well as suggestions for activities, and easy to read in depth graphics.<br /><br />Even as someone who is a self proclaimed desk jockey(spend most of my time at a desk behind a screen) its an indispensable tool. Its great to be able and check driving conditions, or even air pollution levels.<br /><br />I couldn't recommend this app enough. (I did manage to pick this up for free, but I would still happily pay for it). Beautiful, simple, and handy.
B00BLCHZC2|4|I expected a bit more roughness and cruelty from the barbarians.... regardless... it grows on you... now on to season 2!!!
B004GUSG4M|4|I liked the ending.  Good twist.  A lot of thoughts about people and I insights were  shared that all of us have in our everyday lives.
B000002C2E|1|This album is a dirge.  And a mess.  The Academy was out of their minds to award it a Grammy.  If you want to hear the power and brilliance of Dylan, PLEASE forego this one and skip to his 60's and 70's work. This is one of the artists poorer efforts, and the fact that it has garnered such accolades is a testament  to the pitiable state of current day music. Don't waste your time, there are a hundred great Dylan songs, none of which are here.  He has lost it and is over the hill only the reviewers are too dumbed down to notice.
B0094BB4TW|5|Great way to keep in touch with family and friends.
B00CWVGS10|5|I really love this movie!!  I know that it is not the same as the book, but it is a good adaptation to it and it is what the authors wanted
B004LOMB2Q|5|This app is fantastic for remembering little thoughts that you have during the day. I work as writer and stand up comic. When i get ideas which is all the time i can immediately jot them down. so a premise for a novel, a bit of dialogue for a script, or a joke is not lost because I do not have a pen and paper on me. makes my life so easy and can make yours too.
B00F88H5K2|4|Fabulous acting by Michael Douglas and Matt Damon.  Many things about Liberace I didn't know so was also very informative.
1442337966|4|I quite enjoyed The Power. I listened to it everyday on my way to and from work. Quite entertaining and fascinating.<br /><br />I believe in positive thinking and was interested in all the examples she gave about how positive thinking works in our lives.<br /><br />Some of it was a little bit hard to swallow. I pretty much agreed with it all till she got to the part about how we don't have to die. The only reason people die (per her theory) is because we believe we're supposed to get old/sickly and die. Even if it is true, I'm not so sure I want to live 500 years--imagine the taxes!! Plus, Social Security would be pretty non-existent by then!!<br /><br />She (and the Power) is all about positivity. Turning away from negative thoughts/feelings.<br />So mostly, it is great and so interesting that it went fast.<br /><br />Enjoy and take what is good from it and use it in your life. We'd all be better people if we were more positive.

0792833279|1|I love this movie , but I am returning this DVD for refund because it is a fake widescreen! All they did was cut off the top and bottom of a 4/3 image all the way... I can't stand false advertising!
B000J10ERO|5|I give it 5 stars not as an overall movie but 5 stars in the Pantheon of Superman flicks alone.<br /><br />This is by far the best of the Superman flicks. I especially loved the fact that they took a favorite movie category of mine - \\"It Never Happened\\" - and ignored Superman III and Superman IV !! Hah hah hah! I loved it!<br /><br />Here's to wishing that Mr Singer gets to make more Superman flicks in his own vision. Very, very nice. Great family fun!<br /><br />Buy it. I did.
B00006ZXSK|5|Drew Barrymore in not slight, nor is she a pushover as Daniella, the real Cinderella.  In this twist of the fairy tale as we have come to know, Ever After has made the fairy tale more realistic without the fairy godmother and the magic.  Instead, this girl uses her smarts and courage to win the heart of the prince.  I was not a Drew Barrymore fan until I watched this film, and although she had received criticism for the accent used in the film, soon you forget and accept the accent as part of Daniella.  This is now part of my chick films and lit library.  What else is in this library?  Roman Holiday, Prince and Me, Bridget Jones Diary, Princess Diaries, Diary of a Discount Donna, A Cinderella Story, and Pretty Woman.
B00KX44P22|5|I received this dvd set in a timely manner and have enjoyed watching them tremendously.  I hated to get to the end of them.  I highly recommend this series!
B00IJJUIMY|4|Harry is one of the great crime novel characters and Connelly always is true to him.  As the story unfolds and nears the conclusion, the tension is palpable.  Enjoyed every page.
B004YW4L5K|5|I've always loved Neil Gaiman, read him when I was younger and had someone recommend this book of his to me recently. You should absolutely read it! It's a very compelling story about the nature of belief, about the nature of love and sacrifice, and most importantly about knowing yourself. Also who doesn't like a book where the main character is named Shadow?
B0047Y17P2|5|I've seen a lot of reviews giving this book just one star over as a protest to the pricing. Is that really necessary? I understand the frustration, as it seems that customers are being gouged, but taking that frustration out on Mr. Connelly doesn't seem right. Say your piece in your review, and then give the story itself a fair rating. It isn't right to punish the author as I'm sure he's not the one making out like a bandit with the pricing, but rather his publisher. Again, I REALLY understand the frustration, charging more for the kindle edition as opposed to the hardback is patently ridiculous, but do bear in mind that the hardback is on sale. At least we aren't being charged shipping ;-)

0967984602|5|I read the book, and immediately wanted to build an oven.<br />Wonderfully written and easy to follow. It was so easy in fact that i was able to build my oven, with the help of my 10 year old son over the summer. Man hours totatled about 30. I will now build a friends oven as a surprsie next weekend! IT is that easy!<br />Read this book and you too will realize that you can indeed built your own oven, easily, cheaply and with fun for all involved.<br />*Build your own Earth Oven* is simply AMAZING!
0061438294|1|Title says it all. Unless your a complete moron or an alien that just landed on our planet this book is for you.  ex..rubbing ones head shows discomfort, shrugging shoulders shows uncertainty and lack of commitment and insecurity...etc..lol.
B0000029J5|5|I commented on Keb Mo in an earlier post, but he is worth talking about again. A talent that I am so glad I have been introduced to through Pandora. It bugs me I had never heard of him before. But if you want a true blue blues sound here it is! I had read up on him and apparently he has received best blues guitar awards from the American Music awards (I think that was it). He deserves that and more. A must hear for blues fans

B001N09BDS|3|I didn't believe Leo in the role. I 'm not sure who could have done it better- a young Tommy Lee Jones , perhaps.<br />Cate Blanchett  was very good.<br />Nice looking film falling short on drama-just saying.

B005LAIIJY|5|Excellent movie
B00005QZ7U|3|Oh my, I can see the appeal this movie has on young girls. Its got everything---and it almost looks like it was set up for them as an audience. Ugh. As an adult....eeew. I found this movie hard to sit through. I was disappointed that all the songs seemed to be taken from other sources. No originals---would we put up with an original musical, however, nowadays? Yes, the whole movie is eyecandy, the story is the sappy story of love and all that and the obstacles against them. Sweet story. Yes yes. And the whole dying scene was overdone, overplayed. It was just---too romantic for me? Dare I say that? I just wasn't impressed. I guess I didn't get it. Satine's name even looks like its spelled wrong.<BR>The whole premise: a bohemian dude shows up at the Moulin Rouge and falls for the courtesan, Satine ie Nicole Kidman. Always gorgeous yet cold. He has never fallen in love. Boo hoo. Well, they fall in love. But the duke! He must have her! The evil duke must have whats mine! The young lovers meet behind the dukes back, tee hee. Then the scenario builds to its finale, Satine is dying, oh the drama! If you are between the ages of 7-27, I believe you'll love this movie. Don't get me wrong, I cried in the end too, but boy was I glad it was over! Yeehaw!
B008Y7045C|3|Light entertainment.
B00G5G7K7O|5|We saw this in the theater and couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD so we could watch it again. We have a new granddaughter so we bought the two-disc set, letting her parents have one and we keep the other for visits. Haven't figured out yet who gets the digital copy, but I imagine it will be going to my daughter to put on her laptop for travel. Can't imagine why anyone would buy the single disc version when you can get the two-disc one and share it with family.
0525953728|1|First, this book is written on an 6th grade level. It is dry, without suspense or any real substance, and boring. The Bin Laden raid takes up the last few pages. The rest of it is a lot of blather about other deployments that contain absolutely nothing to sink your teeth into. It's all filler. There is nothing in this book that draws the reader in, grabs them, and won't let go, and there is very little factual information that isn't already known. The author states that he wanted to set the record straight. The only thing set straight is that Bin Laden was simply shot without putting up a fight as opposed to engaging the SEALS in his own defense, as was generally reported. Big deal. In the industry books like \\"No Easy Day\\" are called \\"instant books.\\" These are books rushed into print to cash in before somebody else does. Usually they involve disasters or other high-profile current event subjects that the publisher knows will sell big whether they have anything to say or not. This one does not. All those who gave it 5 stars have obviously never surpassed the reading level mentioned above. If you want to read a fascinating, compelling, and memorable account of a SEAL in action, read \\"Lone Survivor\\" by Marcus Luttrell.
B000WZAE1I|2|I love this movie BUT the frustration of watching the movie with the incredible sound issues makes it almost unbearable. I have to turn it up for dialogue, down for sound affects. I'm not certain it's worth the effort.  It certainly pisses me off every time I try to watch it!  What a horrible waste of a great movie!  LOVE DeNiro!

0439813786|5|\\"The Invention of Hugo Cabret\\" takes place in Paris, in the early 20th century. It tells the tale of an orphan named Hugo who secretely lives in a train station and fixes the clocks, unbeknownst to the stationmaster. Hugo is not just an ordinary boy however. In addition to his deftness with clocks, he also has a gift with all mechanical objects and spends much of his time stealing odds and ends from the toymaker's booth in order to fix up his personal pieces of clockwork. One such piece is a large mechanical man left to him by his father that has the capability of relating a mysterious message to him. Hugo is convinced that the message will be from his father beyond the grave and so he is obssessed with fixing the mechanical man any way that he can.   What makes this tale unique and proves Selznick's mastery at storytelling is the way in which he chooses to tell it. At first glance, the book is thick and daunting, especially to a child who is fearful of too many words on a page. This story however, is told half through words and half through pictures. Selznick's lively and touching drawings prove his talent as an artist and much of the story is gleaned through study of these pictures. While one could zip through the story in an hour, you wouldn't want to because so much can and should be absorbed through a careful study of his artwork.   I recommend this book highly to those who are interested in unique methods of storytelling as well as to those children who are simply not all that interested in books. While it might seem a cop out to give a child a book that is told largely through pictures I believe that it can be quite useful in helping children to feel confident in reading something that might at first glance appear too daunting to pick up. Studying such pictures can help to improve their attention to detail in a story as well as help them to feel a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. Ages 9 and up.
B008602KQI|5|The Hunger Games is riviting from the beginning. It holds the viewers attention and is a surprise at every turn. Not so unlikely for our future . Good movie.

0061726834|3|Using a friend's account<br /><br />*Spolier-free review*<br />by Moslimah<br /><br />In a dystopian world, love is a disease. Scientists have finally found a way to eradicate love, and the government demands that all its citizens receive the cure upon turning eighteen. With the cure, a person is able to live a life without pain; one that is safe, measured, predictable and happy. Lena Haloway has been looking forward to being cured but as she approaches her eighteenth birthday the unthinkable happens. She falls in love.<br /><br />I was not blown away by this book but neither was I completely disappointed. The idea of love being a disease that needs to be eradicated is intriguing and worked well in this book. I think the reason I found it so compelling is that, at some times it mirrored Islam's view on premarital relationships. Of course, Islam does not seek to eradicate love, however, it prohibits mingling with the opposite sex, other than what is needed for married and unmarried people. So the rules in DELIRIUM of no touching, kissing or excessive talking is the same for Muslims. However, despite the appeal, I have some issues with this book.<br /><br />I truly believe that DELIRIUM (400+ pages) could have been two thirds the size it was and not have taken away from the story. I agree with many other readers that the author's writing is wonderful and at times, almost poetic. However, it was overly descriptive for my taste and could have been cut down significantly. Also, I could say that there were exactly three moments where the book became exciting for about ten pages and then went back to trudging along.<br /><br />Another issue is that Lena seems to make decisions out of nowhere. In certain parts of the book, she is so determined that the government's rules are right and good, which is why I was confused when, the next second, she does the exact opposite to what she believed in. it didn't seem believable to me.<br /><br />I was disappointed to see that the author made lying okay, if it was for love. Lena quickly fell into the habit of lying. Lying is never okay and putting this idea in the book may comfort teenagers into thinking that they can lie because they're in love.<br /><br />When Lena does the unthinkable, and falls in `love' with Alex, I was not so thrilled about how absolutely crazy he made her. There is a big difference between love and infatuation and to me, Lena seemed infatuated rather than in love. True love is not meant to make you addicted or make you lose your sanity. Rather, it is meant to be something that is wholesome and beautiful. On the same topic, I found that the dialogue, especially that between Alex and Lena fell flat and was even clich&eacute;d and roll-your-eyes worthy.<br /><br />I will still be reading PANDEMONIUM, book two in the trilogy, in hope that there will be more action less roll-your-eye moments.hor made lying okay, if it was for love.

B002VECM6S|5|Great movie!
B00003CWPR|5|Although I am a very loyal Kubrick fan, I enter all films with an open mind. Eyes Wide Shut is a tale of sexual obsession and jealously that is at all times gripping, and darkly humorous. I will say it is not for all  tastes because it is a somewhat ambiguous film (like all Kubrick's works)  and is cleverly paced. I think this was a very personal project that Mr.  Kubrick created the way he wanted to, and the result is worth multiple  viewings.
B00QW8TYWO|5|Awesome game it is fun,easy,cool
B005SEYOXW|5|I had heard before about how rabid the fans for this show were and that was a bit of a turn off, until I watched.<br /><br />Joss Whedon and the whole crew deserve respect for this.  Mixing many genres of style and languages well in a future that's neither utopian nor dystopian was a pleasure to watch.  The characters are deep, interesting, and likable (even Jayne... sorta).<br /><br />My favorite character turned out to be one I thought would be shallow but gave me a new take on what romance is.<br /><br />Lots of deep thought went into and are expressed in this show.  It truly is a gem.<br /><br />If you watch shows just for fun you may like this.  If you watch shows to feed your mind with art, then you will love this.
B004FEL6GO|5|incredible as seen on the pictures
B00UKHNKPA|5|***Erotica***<br /><br />Move along if you don't Erotica! Because this is as hot as it gets! I love BDSM stories and read these indulgently over the last few days. This is a superb collection worth revisiting. I really enjoyed the way the stories connected despite each being it's own standalone. I will be looking for more by this author soon.
B009ZQ8FQG|4|I am hooked on this literate and sometimes campy soap. With good one liners and excellent actors delivering those lines, I just had to watch season three, even though I did know ahead how it would end, sadly. I enjoyed the season, but not as much as the other two. Certain plot lines were repetitious and two childbirth related cast exits were lacking in imagination and were gratuitously depressing.
B00C7KXUOE|5|Love this show.
B004A9F9ZI|4|I barely watched the first episode for Season 1, and i gotta say simply magnificent. The story is good, there's a lot of suspense, keeps you thinking between \\"yes\\" and \\"no\\"<br /><br />I bought the season 1 HD (Amazon Instant Video), and i have to say some scenes are not so HD like. And yes, i do have a fast internet connection. I experience scuffs in a couple of scenes. My only explanation would be if by HD, this shows it in 720p, and not 1080. For the most part though, the show will grab your attention and those scuffy HD scenes may not bug you.
B00GY0HJ4K|5|I love this game so much
B002X9GX4S|5|AMAZING. This is Alesna's best CD so far, It is written so well. I literally think about it all the time and want to listen to it all the time. This is a must buy
B002ZTIIXK|5|I needed some new CD's for a road trip and she has always been a favorite.  This was a great double CD set to ad to the collection for some travelling tunes.
B007PT3QOQ|3|I love this game it keeps telling me to update I try but nothing happens. it just keeps telling me the same thing.
B005RDF2RG|1|I played this for my kids so that me and my husband could spend some quiet time on the porch. That did not happen because the movie kept stopping or pausing.
B001EN71DQ|5|This was given as a gift.  I have not heard how the quality is.    However, I was pleased with the way it arrived in a timely manner  and was able to give it as a Christmas gift.
B00J2VSS0C|4|I love hidden object games, especially if they are in story mode. This one took a very long time to download. But once it did it worked fine. Just takes up a lot of space.
B0000AQS0F|5|Thoughtful story arcs, real people who were growing and expanding into delightful (and sometimes frightening) characters.  Adventure. Romance. Science fiction and a little touch of westerns all rolled up into one great show I was VERY happy to have stumbled across - and then just as I began a fanatic FOX cancelled the show.  Reminds me of a premature Star Trek from Paramount only FOX has a track record of not going back and reviving titles even when they are successful ...<br />If you enjoy Science Fiction this is a must own and even though it's only 1 season there's enough there to be worth seeing.  Nuff said
B003ZSJ212|1|If these Blu-rays feature the 2004 versions, I strongly recommend you do not buy them, because the 2004 versions were a rush job, resulting in messed up picture and audio, and changes that were made at the last minute.     If, by some miracle, these problems are corrected (including properly filming Hayden for the end of Return of the JEdi instead of just using bad stock footage of his head), then this set may be worth my time.     so wait and read the reviews before you buy this. if these Blu-rays are not improved from the 2004 releases, would you really want to lay down the money for a substandard product from a company that is capable of so much more?    otherwise, seek out the 2006 or 2008 releases that have the unaltered versions included.

0374531269|5|It's always difficult to critique someone's memoirs especially when it's non-comedic. It is their re-telling of their lives, their interpretation of events they experienced. How can you review the lenses through which someone is looking at themselves? I think the best I can do is review how the narration affected me.  I first came across Ishamel Beah when he made a book tour stop on Book TV and he came off as a sincere young man with the most innocent smile. I wondered at how much of a survivor he must be - to have undergone and participated in the worst of horrors and still be able to let go of bitterness and smile so cleanly out of his heart. That made an impression on me and I filed ' A Long Way Gone' for reading sometime in the future.   A year later and I am writing a class paper on Sierra Leone's decade-long diamond war and I remembered Ishmael and his book and thought it would give me a great first hand account perspective. It did. So much so I had to stop reading every now and then to give myself emotional and mental breaks, to stop myself from retching, to breathe, to come back into the real world and be reminded that goodness and light still do exist.    I like that he avoids glorifying violence, that he is not a gratuitous writer. I also like that he does not fall into the trap of poor stylistic writing like many other memoir authors who take for granted that since they are telling the truth, literary style should not matter. A story is only ever good if it is told well regardless of if it is factual or fictional.    In the course of researching my paper, I came across claims that disputed the veracity of Beah's claims of being a boy soldier. While I do not condone any type of literary dishonesty, I do think it wise to have hard evidence that disproves Beah. They could for instance investigate UNICEF records, interview his extended family in Freetown and so forth.  I personally believed Beah's story. I found no reason not to. It is pretty standard to exaggerate or embellish facts. We all do that in everyday life and it is an accepted literary device. Also, considering the trauma and the time frame between experiencing those events and writing the book, is it not possible he could have unintentionally gotten his dates and timeline of events mixed up?    I could go on and on but I think the point of the book was to bring attention to the tragic use of child soldiers in warfare, the lack of sufficient psychological counseling for former child soldiers, the bleak future of a generation of Sierra Leone's limbless youth and raising money for his foundation which tackles these issues. I think that was/is his point and should be ours too.
B00T3DNKIE|4|I was glad to read this as To Kill a Mockingbird is a favorite of mine.  Some of this was a bit painful emotionally.
B0000X61VE|3|This workout video is good. It gives 3 options, which is great if you don't have time to do a long workout. The variation is great and really works all parts of the body. It goes by quickly and I feel like I really got a great workout when it is over. My only complaint is that the reps are a little too fast and I sacrifice form for reps. Try \\"The Next Challenge\\" by Cindy Crawford. It's her second video and improved on the first.
B00CATSONE|5|Nicola Tesla's story is so inspirational to my life, I would recommend it to anyone with curiosity of the world.
0061537969|1|This author totally missed the point of writing from the perspective of a dear, sweet animal.  He laced his book with so much Hollywood type vile and offensive language that the beauty of the dog's life gets totally lost.  A dog using the F word, the S word, the B words--really??? C'mon.  This book lost me a fourth of the way through because of the stupid and unbelievable language. I would not recommend this book to anyone.  I threw my copy in the trash.
B00IIUATDM|3|Was not impressed
0761172726|5|I get this calendar every year.  It's the only way I can keep up with everyone's schedule.  The stickers are a cute addition too.
0066620996|3|This was a good read but kind of a letdown. The statement, &#34;Mediocrity is always in opposition to greatness,&#34; really made me think. It takes a lot of hard work to be great. The research that was conducted by Jim Collins and his researchers was very interesting and it sure talked a lot about the leaders of companies. I have always had a negative opinion on big business. Most corporate executives seem to be driven by the thought of padding their own pockets, rather than building up the company that they work for. The companies that were part of the research, for instance, Wells Fargo vs. Bank of America and Walgreens vs. Eckerd, have very interesting dynamics. In order to make a company great, Collins discusses that a humble, driven and selfless leader is necessary. Principles that make a company great, are timeless, such as honesty, integrity and hard work. Collins also discusses the importance of what he calls a “Level 5 Leader”. A level 5 leader is someone who has humility and intense professional will. Collins discusses that these qualities can be very hard to find in a leader. That is why many companies are not able to make the transition from good to great.<br /><br />What I really didn’t like is that I feel like I really wasn’t give information on why his research was so scientific. I was looking for his methods and reasoning’s behind why his data was so scientific and how the mounds and mounds of literature would equate to scientific research. I understand his stance and his information, and don’t get me wrong, this was a pretty good book. I just don’t think that he offered enough backing about the data that was collected. I also do not feel like I received enough information about why a company is so great. The book mainly discussed the type of leader that is necessary to make a corporation great. Level 5 leaders are what make a company great. I just feel like there are so many more things that make a company great, and it is not just the leader of the organization. There are other people who make the organization.<br /><br />I was looking for more then what I got out of this book. Which is why I can only give it a rating of 3 stars. I feel like Jim Collins used his name to write this book. What I mean by this is I feel like he didn’t have sufficient data and that I am supposed to just believe in this book because he is Jim Collins. He emphasizes over and over about leadership. This book didn’t give tips or information that would show how to make a company great. It just kind of makes me believe that one person or one group of leaders makes the business. Also I was shocked to read that technology doesn’t necessarily make the company, it just is an asset. In this day and age, technology is EVERYTHING. If you are not connected to Facebook and Twitter or any of the other social networks, then you are kind of irrelevant. That seems to hold true with companies as well. This book overall was pretty good, I just felt kind of let down by it.e organization.

B00IJJUIMY|5|always a good read
B00AEJM6H2|5|I love it
B00HUCF420|1|Some spoilers...<br /><br />True Detective is a painfully dark, depressing, brutal and ugly story about very horrible and sick people doing evil things.<br /><br />The two detectives, played by Harrelson and McConaughey, are bad people themselves who, in the course of the show, commit adultery, murder, kidnapping, beatings, thievery (B&Es) and perjury.  They freely break the law in supposed pursuit of the law, as well as bungle up their own case on more than one occasion, which makes them Horrible Detectives, probably a more apt title for the show.<br /><br />The story wallows in the worst depravity of human behavior—rape, murder, child rape, child murder, child torture, satanic rituals, etc.  The two detectives pursuing these child and woman rapists and killers.  Unfortunately, their investigation is told in a very slow, drawn out, murky and convoluted manner with tons of distracting flashbacks—most of the show told in this annoying flashback style.<br /><br />And even more unfortunate, the few culprits the detectives do apprehend (I mean kill), turn out to be nothing more than inbred hillbilly types—stock characters from crappy movies like the “Wrong Turn” series.<br /><br />In fact, most of True Detective is derivative of other movies such as Se7en, Zodiac, The Usual Suspects, Silence of the Lambs, as well as lesser movies like Kiss the Girls and Along Came a Spider, and cheesy slasher/horror movies like Wrong Turn.<br /><br />Overall, the first season is a 8 hour journey through misery, depression and darkness;  much of the story wallowing in the detectives’ own sad and bitter personal lives, an unwelcome and entirely unnecessary diversion from their investigation.  By the end of the show, you’re hoping for some payoff, but all we got was a major let down of an ending, and I couldn’t help but think:  That’s it…?  That sucked.<br /><br />I would never watch a second of this show again.<br /><br />And truly great HBO shows I often watch time and time again, like The Sopranos, Rome and Game of Thrones.<br /><br />HBO really hit skid row and wallowed in the gutter with True Detective.  This show is one of HBO’s worst.
B000002G7G|5|The VU's self-titled album was so laid back and folky compared to their intense prior albums, the Banana Album and White Light/White Heat. Credit this difference to bassist Doug Yule, whose jangly, almost poppy rhythms bear no resemblance to John Cale's uniquely cutting viola work. Yule's inclusion brings out a less subversive side to the band that had been hinted at with the inverted pop of There She Goes or Sunday Morning from the Banana Album. However, the self-titled album is still very VU in its own arty way, unlike Loaded which was ruined by commercial expectations.<br /><br />Without Nico or Cale hogging the limelight, Lou Reed comes to the fore here, with his sneer being tempered by an understated emotional edge--after the dissonant anarchy that was White Light/White Heat, Lou seems to be at peace with himself. Pale Blue Eyes, Beginning To See The Light, and I'm Set Free reflect this new sensibility. Sterling Morrison's guitar work is as brilliant as ever, and Doug Yule rounds out the band nicely. However, the real standout is drummer Moe Tucker, with both her minimalist percussion and innocuous, charming vocals on the moving After Hours.<br /><br />No real VU album is complete without at least one avant-garde foray, and here resides the unique Murder Mystery. Unlike the noisy European Son and Sister Ray this one is actually rather subdued (though very weird) as Reed and Tucker engage in call-and-answer vocal performances that add an unsettled feeling to the piece.<br /><br />Altogether this album is without a single weak moment, and is a great place to start your education in the VU. A highly recommended classic.
B0053O89IS|4|I was concerned this season would lose some of It's flavor with Booth and Brennan as a couple, as well as parents; though we all longed to see this day... However I was not at all let down by the episodes in season 7. Therebwas romance, mystery, comedy, and reality in Bones/ Booth and Angela/Jack sneaking the babies in to the lab.  I enjoyed being angry with Bones for leaving Booth at the finale!! While understanding it was likely the best decision. Not having seen ANY of the Season 8 Episodes, for want of viewing all of Season 7, before watching even one in Season 8: I anxiously awaited, discovering the outcome of Bones on the run, Booth without his family, and Angela defending her best friend against all odds! It was fantastic!!!! My only reason for giving season 7 a four of five stars, is because there were far too few episodes this time. I'm use to twice as many. Since Emily was ACTUALLY PREGNANT, and likely had leave of absence for maternal reasons, I completely understand: and therefore give 4 3/4 stars for Bones Season 7!.

0895260131|5|After spending four tours in Iraq and just getting home from the last one, I can say that what is said in this book is correct.     There is no more the rising threat, but the threat that has already risen and is here in the US.     I suggest you, the reader, understand that Islam is more a tribal/political system than it is a religion. It's about control and who can gain it. I know there will be critics saying we have done the same. But the US has evolved and surrounds itself with life - or rebirth. Islam is engulfed in death and chaos.     Buy this book and read it to your children - educate them - Islam is worst than communism could ever dream of being. I also suggest the book, Because They Hate, Islamic Invasion, and Hostage to the Devil to see - or at least read - what US military personnel are experiencing in defending your rights here in the US.

0307959473|5|Secretary Gates has a long history of severing our country and he did our country proud by telling it like it is in his book &#34;Duty&#34;.<br />Having been an NCO in the 11th Airborne Division it make me proud when he fired a General who tried to shift the blame to his NCOs in the hospital scandal. Secretary Gates will long be remember as a great American who stood up for the military and his book reflects those principals.
B005LAIGRS|3|It's been a long time since there's been reason to be excited over a Denzel Washington movie. Ever since his Oscar win for his heelish turn in Training Day, the actor has mostly been content to coast along in exciting, but not terribly challenging thrillers alongside bland co-stars. It's like someone is constantly trying to find a way to recreate the Training Day magic between Washington and Ethan Hawke. Denzel is always the coolest guy in the room, the one with the confidence and steely reserve that everybody else in the movie lacks. His smile indicates he knows something nobody else does, and there's never really any doubt he'll succeed. That same formula is employed yet again in Safe House, but with an abundance of style thanks to Swedish director, Daniel Espinosa, that makes this an intense thrill ride worth checking out even if feels a touch familiar.<br /><br />Washington's muted co-star this time is Ryan Reynolds, playing bored, untested CIA agent Matt Weston. Matt has pretty much everything he could want: a supremely hot girlfriend who adores him, equally unfair good looks himself, and a cushy position house sitting a safe house in the heart of Cape Town, South Africa. That's not enough for him, though, as he yearns to step out into the field and really earn his stripes.<br /><br />The phrase \\"Be careful what you wish for\\" comes back to bite Matt in the rear end when ex-CIA agent turned international terrorist Tobin Frost comes waltzing into a nearby embassy and turns himself in. He's got something that has kicked up a violent hornet's nest of activity, with all the world's assassins looking to put a bullet in him and take it. What is it? Doesn't really matter, and the script doesn't seem all that concerned with it, either. The only thing that matters is that Frost can't go anywhere without someone looking to put a knife in his back, and even the CIA safe house he's holed up in is stormed by armed killers.<br /><br />Frost hardly seems phased, even as he's forced to go on the run with a green as grass agent like Weston. Actually, Frost seems to revel in the experience gap, twisting Weston's mind like a pretzel even as he fights for his life, surviving one ridiculous shoot out or car chase after another. Not even the threat of waterboarding seems to phase Frost, as he's more concerned with the type of towel being used on him. His calm, while fun to watch thanks to Denzel's icy charms, is also a little irritating considering the seriousness of the situation<br /><br />The heavily lauded script by David Guggenheim lacks sufficient twists and witty banter, and you'll see the big swerve coming from a hundred yards away. How it landed on the Black List, Hollywood's annual selections of the best unproduced screenplays, is beyond me. The pace remains at a breakneck speed throughout, but what you want is more of Frost spinning Weston's head like a dreidle. We just don't get nearly enough of it, and too much of the rather weak mystery of a corrupt official within the CIA. What? A corrupt government agent in a spy thriller? Surely you jest. Vera Farmiga and Brendan Gleeson are wasted in this go nowhere subplot, which pans out exactly as you think it does. Ryan Reynolds is just over matched in every conceivable way opposite Denzel. While it's good to see him not playing the wise cracking pretty boy for once, his character is too weak to shine.<br /><br />It's amazing how every Denzel Washington film ends up looking like Tony Scott-lite. Daniel Espinosa, who showed he's a talent to watch after his nervy crime pic, Snabba Cash(known here as Easy Money), initially falls into the same category before settling into a serious groove. His style remains kinetic and and a little crazy at times, but he manages to find moments of calm where Scott can't stay on any scene longer than two seconds. The firefights brutal hand-to-hand brawls have a Bourne Identity feel to them, dizzying and visceral.<br /><br />So it's another solid outing for Denzel, one he can do in his sleep.The film will get your blood pumping, and might even make you laugh once or twice. It just could have been a lot better, with a stronger co-star and better script. Now if only Denzel would leave the safe house his career has been shacked up in and take some risks.zel, one he can do in his sleep.The film will get your blood pumping, and might even make you laugh once or twice. It just could have been a lot better, with a stronger co-star and better script. Now if only Denzel would leave the safe house his career has been shacked up in and take some risks.

0553582461|2|Robin Hobb has an unquestionable position at the pinnacle of speculative fiction, having written not the one but the two best fantasy trilogies of the last generation.  And even in the first two books of the Tawny Man trilogy she kept up a quite high standard.  But something happened on the way to the conclusion.  For sure \\"Fool's Fate\\" reads like a Robin Hobb novel.  The dialogue is intelligent, the characters astonishingly real, the world-building careful and solid, and the writing good at a technical level.  At a deeper level, however, Hobb has completely lost sight of what makes a good story.<br /><br />The best I can say for \\"Fool's Fate\\" is that it's a nine-hundred page book which may have a decent three-hundred page book lurking somewhere inside.  We left on in \\"Golden Fool\\" with our heroes anticipating their upcoming quest to slay the dragon Icefyre.  In \\"Fool's Fate\\" they spend one hundred pages at Buckkeep packing and preparing, one hundred pages sailing to the Out Islands, one hundred pages dithering around on an island, and another hundred dithering on a different island.  Four hundred pages gone before the plot is really in motion.<br /><br />We often fear that successful authors simply include anything that comes into their head, and their editors aren't brave enough to hack off unwarranted text.  Sadly that's exactly the case here.  One obvious example: Fitz taking care of Thick.  This consumes well over a hundred pages, with Fitz feeding Thick, dressing Thick, watching Thick be seasick, dragging Thick onto ships, arguing with Thick, fighting with Thick, etc...  This hits the crux of the problem with \\"Fool's Fate\\".  Hobb wants to say things that are true regardless of whether they're interesting.  So yes, of course retarded people were often abused and mistreated in past eras and yes a good person should treated the mentally challenged with respect.  But watching Fitz nursemaid Thick is like reading a novel about paint drying.  Needless to say Thick ends up doing something important at the end and thus justifying his presence on the quest.  But his role is trivially small.  Hobb could have written Thick out of the book entirely, and should have.  Like Jar Jar Binks, he single-handedly turns a decent artwork into a lousy one just by existing.<br /><br />Thick, though, is merely a victim of a larger disease: the dreaded bloat.  Conversations go on ten pages, fifteen pages, or more.  We see events that have no place in the story, visit places we don't need to see, hear the same thoughts repeated over and over.  We get a list of every character's emotions and facial expressions at every paragraph.<br /><br />Even after all this, \\"Fool's Fate\\" might have been redeemed by a good climactic showdown.  But that flops too.  The largest problem with the entire Tawny Man Trilogy is that the villains are so lame.  Laudwine was a paper tiger.  The new villainess in \\"Fool's Fate\\" is a horrendous cliche straight out of a Terry Goodkind novel: evil, laughs maniacally, sex-crazed, tortures people for no particular reason.<br /><br />Ultimately \\"Fool's Fate\\" collapses due to lack of planning and self-control.  Without a goal worth caring about, without progression towards a well-defined conclusion, there's just no reason to keep reading.  Several times I was on the verge of giving up; were this written by any other author, I most likely would have.  We can only hope that Hobb will get back on track with her next project.ck ends up doing something important at the end and thus justifying his presence on the quest.

The new villainess in \\"Fool's Fate\\" is a horrendous cliche straight out of a Terry Goodkind novel: evil, laughs maniacally, sex-crazed, tortures people for no particular reason. <br /> <br />Ultimately \\"Fool's Fate\\" collapses due to lack of planning and self-control.  Without a goal worth caring about, without progression towards a well-defined conclusion, there's just no reason to keep reading.  Several times I was on the verge of giving up; were this written by any other author, I most likely would have.  We can only hope that Hobb will get back on track with her next project.

B001JE25ZE|4|Pros: Alright, so this guy can write. He can even write well, most of the time. Good. He can even write well and manage not to contradict established scientific facts. Great. He writes well, pens good action sequences, and creates witty dialog. Amazing! But is he among the best? Man, there are a few short stories in here that are nothing short of gold, just gold. He spares not the details nor the mood, and the characters are seductively real. He has sympathy for the feminine persona that is dynamic and believable. He sticks to the story as opposed to weird tangents that have nothing to do with anything. Yes, he's really really good.<br /><br />Cons: The \\"weakest\\" section of this collection is the novella \\"I am Legend.\\" Yes it is worthy of the title of classic as it does vampires right yet again (Twilight, this ain't) with a fresh perspective that is necessary when you reuse a classic image like the vampire. Its weak point is its main character. Perhaps realistically, he fumbles about quite a bit and has deep emotional problems that prevent him from taking care of things until crisis is inevitable. This is a little more distracting that I would've liked, for I was fascinated by the vampire plague the author masterfully constructs and with a flawed lens, there are some things that we never get around to. Fortunately, this isn't the only story with the undead in it.<br /><br />Summary: These days, we take horror survival techniques for granted, but in the 1950s when this was written, they'd only just passed the golden age of film horror. Goth subculture predecessors like the Munsters and the Addams Family hadn't hit the scene yet. Horror was presented by the likes of Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, and Vincent Price. For its time, this survival-horror genre book, with accompanying short stories featuring so many psychic and apocalyptic visions, is a real rarity and genuinely good despite its age. It stands well above most of its contemporaries, such as Psycho by Robert Bloch or The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson. And, not to be a spoiler, none of the movies do it credit - NONE.ng of Hill House by Shirley Jackson. And, not to be a spoiler, none of the movies do it credit - NONE.

0393072231|5|Author Lewis has fashioned a pithy, fast-paced description of the events, people, and financial instruments leading up to and causing the financial collapse of several venerable Wall Street firms and contributing to a nationwide financial recession.    In a readable rendition that is both informative and entertaining, Lewis explains credit default swaps, CMO's, CDO's, tranches, and bond rating systems in a way that clarifies these arcane securities in the context of their human creators and traders.    To understand recent economic history and comprehend and comment on currently proposed Wall Street and banking regulation, reading this book is a must.

B0030GJ50C|1|I did not like this, could not get through it, incredibly boring. I don't care how well made the alien bugs were, you gotta have a story to back it up. The premise is great. Beyond that...nothing. Took itself WAY too seriously, which is hard to do after watching these scorpion/lobster things stalking around for a while. Go see Independence Day instead.
6305428522|5|A movie like Quiz Show is entertaining on so many levels...where to begin.<br /><br />The opening sequence; I don't know what it is about Bobby Darin singing Mack the Knife and the behind the scenes look at America turning on their TV's, but the opening few minutes pull you into a period of history.<br /><br />From that sequence the script moves swiftly, the characters are tightly drawn, and the stage is set for a morality play asking viewers about the nature of integrity.<br /><br />While all acting in this movie is outstanding, the direction almost transcends these solid performances, making the actors look like they are simply doing their job rather than carrying a story.<br /><br />That said, I really enjoyed Rob Morrow, perhaps for the surprising depth of his acting ability (I didn't know he had it in him). Ralph Fiennes seems like an actor you expect greatness from (and he delivers). Hank Azaria is great. And John Turturo is outstanding.<br /><br />Overall there are few movies I will watch repeatedly just to follow a sequence or hear an actor utter a few lines of dialog. This is certainly one those movies.<br /><br />After A River Runs Through It and Quiz Show, you'd think Robert Redford can do no wrong. But then you watch the Horse Whisperer...

0307341569|4|First off, Flynn's second novel is a very strange book, filled with odd characters in bizarre situations. But that's okay. She proved in Sharp Objects that she does \\"strange\\" very effectively. Libby Day is thirty-one and still suffering the effects of being the only survivor of the murder of her family when she was seven. Her mother and her two older sisters were slaughtered before her ears (in a truly horrific scene) and now her brother, Ben, who was fifteen at the time, is in prison for life. The undersized Libby has spent her whole life in the dark places. She's violently aggressive, pathologically lazy, paranoid, a liar, and a klepto. But still, she's not a bad person. Now the trust fund, established at the time by donations from a sympathetic public, is about to run out and she has to get hold of some money quick. That's where the Kill Club comes in. Its members are fans of -- or, more often, obsessed with -- murders that are either unsolved or in which they believe there has been a miscarriage of justice. And there are more than a few, mostly women, who believe Ben is innocent -- as he always said he was, and despite Libby's own obviously coerced confession. The club will pay Libby to go and interview people involved with the case, which is too good a deal to pass up in her time of need. So Libby begins tracking down people who were involved whom she either hoped never to see again (like her deranged deadbeat father) or whose existence she never suspected (like Ben's girlfriend). Naturally, there's far, far more to the murder in that lonely Kansas farmhouse than Libby could have imagined, and Flynn does an excellent job of bringing it all out morsel by morsel in alternating chapters -- Libby in the here-and-now, Ben and their mother in January 1985. The characterization is first-rate and the pace gradually picks up until the last hundred or so pages come at you at a dead gallop. In fact, I stayed up into the small hours to find out what happened, realizing there was no way I was going to be able to sleep without knowing. I can't, in fairness to the prospective reader, say too much about the resolution of the complexly interlocking plots, except to note that the author comes perilously close to a deus ex machina ending. It's a heck of a coincidence. But, as Libby notes, that's the Day luck. Anyway, I'll forgive a lot in exchange for Flynn's adroit and athletic use of the English language.re was no way I was going to be able to sleep without knowing.

B00005JNBQ|4|Let's face it, Hollywood movies usually get real people's lives all wrong.  Doctors make instant diagnoses, cops can hit a dime at a hundred yards, cops never sit at a desk filling out paperwork, and nerds are pretty people who happen to wear glasses. <br /> <br />\\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" is a strange movie,  but the people in it are real nerds, all the folks you knew who had serious trouble relating to others - and didn't suddenly become party animals after smoking a joint. <br /> <br />If you want to see a pretty funny comedy with characters who seem like real people, albeit very eccentric ones, check this one out.

1599218011|5|Kris Carr's Crazy Sexy Diet is more a way of life than a diet.  Carr is an inspiration: many people who've gotten her diagnosis, or something similar, are all too willing to take meds and give up.  I very much appreciate the lesson she teaches, that you can fix yourself from the inside out.  A lot of the things that we've been taught about food are myths and products of subsidies and other deals.  Eating right and being healthy is not hard if you want it.  If you can get over your addictions to sugar and the like, you can change your life.  She makes sense.  As for me, I can tell you that while I was eating healthfully as Carr teaches, I felt great.  Just being and eating clean opened up sources of energy I never knew I had.  Even my attitude was better.  I have since relapsed with my addiction to sugar, and I have to reread this book and snap out of that.  These kinds of books are what you make them.  It is important to note here that not all of the dietary restrictions that Carr prescribes will work for everyone, and she advocates doing what works for you.  The juicing portion of the book is invaluable.  The vitamins and minerals in fresh vegetables and fruits are what moves your system.  I was a little disappointed that there were not more recipes, but Carr has just come out with a new book devoted specifically to juicing and blending.  An alkaline diet is also important.  Think about it: if you can feel the acidity in your body in your chest every night after dinner, say, best to avoid those foods, isn't it?  Germs and viruses thrive in alkaline conditions.  If you could change just a few things in your diet and rid yourself of the flu, bronchitis, yeast infections, bacterial infections, etc., wouldn't you?  I've eliminated certain things in my diet and I've stuck with it, but I'm not going to tell you I don;'t still crave them.  Take soda, for example.  I was a big diet soda drinker, since childhood all the way up until a year or so ago.  Every once in a while,I crave a Coke like you wouldn't believe, but any carbonated drink wreaks havoc on your gastrointestinal system.  Soda is a rare treat rather than the norm in my life.  I'm also starting to reconsider milk.  As I get older, i find my system doesn't tolerate what it used to, and milk falls into this category.  The challenge is that I've grown up, and am still told by my mother, that milk and dairy is the way to get your calcium.  That's not necessarily so.  Why is it more expensive to eat healthy and so much cheaper to hit McDonald's every night?  Because of government subsidies.  I see that a lot of people here are hung up on the language Carr uses.  Way to miss the point.  But I realize her tone doesn't work for everyone.  Personally, I thought the conversational tone, and yes, her use of curse words, is just right for a book that is really geared toward people who have partied too much and made themselves sick.  The language is a masterful move.
B0086213XW|4|Nice movie. Relationships were not as believable as I would have liked,  but the story definitely has a message. Michelle Williams is interesting to watch...took me a little while to recognize how striking she is.

1594202842|3|This book is essentially a chronicle of Amy Chua's life as a mother and her interpretation and application of Chinese parenting. It is not particularly insightful, well-written, informative or interesting. I expected much more from the content and quality of writing considering how the book was about raising superior children who excelled at and mastered pretty much everything. The writing was not compelling or intelligent whatsoever--nothing on par with what I expected from a Yale law professor--and most of the content was anecdotes about drilling her daughters on their respective instruments and fighting with her daughter Lulu. Much of what was written just made Chua seem like a complete and unreasonable nut, which she was surprisingly aware of and insensitive to with regards to her husband and children. The book held my interest although it did get pretty repetitive, but I expected it to be more of an intelligent and reflective cultural comparison than a biography.
0545265355|5|It was totally awesome to get the books at such an amazing price brand new. I truly absolutely loved it.
159562015X|5|This book helped me see where my strengths fit within the larger context of my job, community, and relationships. It also challenged me to see strengths I didn't realize I had. Very eye-opening, helpful, and encouraging.
1589795474|3|I skipped many parts of this book, as it contains too many statistics, maybe it was intended for the cynics. However, the writer made a good and reasonable point at the very beginning of the book. This book would make a good material for documentary, as there are many surprising facts about millionaires. But if you want to be wealthy, this is merely a good start. It gives you the right attitude about wealthiness.<br /><br />You will also have a question some time after finishing the book; \\"if you will have to live frugally, why do you want to be wealthy in the first place?\\" or \\"How can I cash out my investment to enjoy life?\\"
B0000DBJ2B|5|One of my favorite movies of all times. This movie is an inspiring example of what can be achieved when the mind is set free of conventional wisdom. An excellent movie for any age group, from toddlers to adults.
0471267554|4|I can only give this 4 stars instead of five due to the fact that Cordain used the term artery clogging saturated fat. Seriously Cordain's reasoning and logic for a paleo diet based on meat, veggies, fruit, and nuts, was rock solid, so I am perplexed as to why he would think that our ancestors would have not eaten the saturated fatty deposits that the wild game animals had. Of course wild game has less intramuscular fat, but it still has ample deposits of saturated fat, and I am confident that our ancestors were not worried about their cholesterol levels or heart disease. There is no way that they would turn down all of those tasty calories.I also don't like how he does not like butter, but thinks it is okay to cook with flax oil.  The main point of the book is to eliminate the neolithic agents of destruction. Those are grains, legumes, dairy, and of course all modern refined processed foods. The book gives a lot of resources to find higher quality meats, and gives some good recipes and plans. Cordain touches on some of the diseases of civilization and how the paleo diet can help. If you know anyone on the Standard American Diet, I would highly recommend them trying the paleo diet to improve their health. With the exception of his stance on animal fat I highly recommend this book.

B00005UKE0|3|I can't believe the reviews claiming that All Things Must Pass is the best Beatle solo effort. It is pretty good, but doesn't even come close to  Plastic Ono Band and  Imagine by John Lennon or McCartney and Band on the Run by Paul. I have noticed that if one goes back and listens to some of the demos of George Harrison's best Beatles songs (like While My Guitar Gently Weeps), they all sound very simular; TOO simular. I believe that Paul and John took George's raw songs and helped him give them each individual sounds. Without the other Beatles, all George's songs sound almost the same. All Things must Pass suffers greatly from a lack of Paul and John's help (and it is by far George's best album); All the songs have that same old sound and the album seems to  go on and on with all the jamming and trying to stretch one albums worth of mostly mediocre songs into a lot of -wasted- record space. I LOVED some of George's Beatles songs, but I suspect that at least half the credit for those songs should go the other Beatles. I think that that is the reason that Lennon and McCartney never took George seriously as any sort of competition in the song writing department. RIP.

B001E2JNA6|5|This version is long.....like 5 hours long. But it is by far the best, and truest, version out there. Colin Firth plays the perfect Mr. Darcy. I dare anyone to watch this and not fall in love with him. Seriously. It is totally worth the 5 hours. I've seen other versions of P&P, and you don't get the whole story by only watching 2 hours. You get the full story in this version, and it's so excellently done, that you don't realize 5 hours have gone by.
B007HIEBV2|5|I greatly appreciate the originality and thought given in music created by this particular group.  Instead of going with whatever sounds and beats they've heard overused in common popular music, they reach out, experiment, and find something new that they like.  They won't let the mass populous &#34;vote&#34; (so to speak) on what they make, they make the beauty that is in them and give that to us to judge.  I judge it to be incredible.

B00024BHTC|4|Nightwish is one of my favourite bands and I've enjoyed pretty much every album.  This one is no exception.  I first saw the video for &quot;Nemo&quot; and then finally got the album.  Most of the tracks are rather... meh... ok.  But I really enjoy &quot;Wish I Had An Angel&quot; and &quot;Ghost Love Score&quot;.  I gave it 4 stars... because I like it a lot, but as I previously noted... some of the songs are just mediocre or not really that great.  I'd recommend Century Child first if you are just now discovering them.

I always turned off hyperthreading on my i7 due to it not being used by any games & allowing me to overclock further without it, so an i5 was the obvious choice when I went to upgrade. I'm running this processor @ 4.8GHz while cooling it with a Corsair H80 & it's trucking right along.

B000NQRR1Q|2|Fluff. With a certain Agatha Christie quality. No great meditation on Good and Evil. Just a shallow diversion to pass an evening. It descends into low comedy when Emmanuelle Seigner flies down a staircase and gives the villain a karate kick. I think a lot of people would turn the movie off at this point. As a matter of fact, I did. I couldn't imagine something further along that could justify this foolishness.
B004KAWC0C|5|We just returned from Buenos Aires and my wife insisted that we watch it again - I had actually never seen the whole movie. I have to admit that, as a long-time Spanish teacher, I've almost always ignored movies set in Latin America that are originally filmed in English - ugh! For that reason, I had never paid much attention when I saw parts of this film. But, after spending five days in that most marvelous city, visiting el Museo Eva Peron (hate her husband's politics,but have to appreciate the human energy she exerted throughout her life),the Casa Rosada, the Catedral, etc. I have to say the film quite intensely captures the spirit of the Argentinian experience, at least this aspect. Madonna actually does a pretty good job singing and her persona is so similar that of Ms.Peron, while Banderas(whose singing is not up to it, but whose charisma makes up for it -the device of his character in the narrative is ingenious - quite properly calls attention to those points of the period that require underlining. Loved the film.
B000002KFJ|5|I am still waiting for a double cd release of this album. To me, simply their very best ever !  Sabotage is very well produced and performed. It contains some of the heaviest songs ever put on tape by the band !!

B000EGF0B4|5|This film is a great Alternative Love story that can touch your heart if your willing to keep an open mind. This film has won several awards, and is well worth the cost of owning it.

B0019LY5IM|5|LOST 5 was everything I knew it would be and more. Very good all the way through.
B0089LOG02|5|I chose five stars for The Orphan Train because it opened my eyes to hardships and challenges of days gone by that are barely imaginable in today's society, especially in the US.  The story also presented a very good picture of the differences that exist between the generations with regard to manners, language, and propriety.  And yet, in spite of these differences, there is a common thread that binds an elderly woman and a young girl together in friendship and mutual understanding.  The research was thorough and well presented in this novel, leaving the reader with the feeling that this could easily have been a true-life story.
B00IUBXPEY|4|It was not as good as the first in my opinion. It was still well done but I found some of the acting to be a little overdone in this one.
B000000OPU|4|Peter Gabriel's album &quot;So&quot; has achieved classic status in some quarters. It has a few songs that are definitely great, some that are good, and one that I don't really care for. One thing is certain-this man has a whole lot of talent. Few people can write songs that seethe with humanity but at the same time are capable of casting their vision upon something greater. An historic example of this talent that springs to mind is the poet John Donne. Peter Gabriel is also a member of this club.<br />There are three songs that I consider as being &quot;great&quot;on this disc: &quot;That Voice Again,&quot; &quot;In Your Eyes,&quot; and &quot;Mercy Street.&quot;<br />&quot;That Voice Again&quot; echoes Romans 7:15 where Paul says: &quot;I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.&quot; The song is about the struggle within all human relations, the divisions that so dominate our interactions with others and sometimes our own inner selves.<br />&quot;In Your Eyes&quot; speaks of the place where we find our wholeness as beings. Thomas Merton called what Gabriel sings about as &quot;The Hidden Ground of Love,&quot; most folks just call him Jesus. Either way, this song uses some stirring language--filled with allusions and visual imagery--to describe reaching out to the light, heat, and completeness found in this divine center.<br />My favorite song on the disc is &quot;Mercy Street.&quot; Wow...what can I really say other than that this song is an almost perfect thing of beauty. Gabriel's vocals are amazing, the music is introspective, the lyrics help you to share in the journey Gabriel is on.<br />Like Donne, Gabriel writes some songs that I can only describe as &quot;masterpieces of desire&quot; (sometimes lust). &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; is a prime example of Gabriel's talent in this area.<br />&quot;Big Time,&quot; &quot;Don't Give Up,&quot; and to some extent &quot;We Do What We're Told&quot; offer critiques of societies and cultures that have become cynical and abusive.<br />&quot;Red Rain&quot; (a pretty decent song in its own right) serves as a good opener to the disc. It draws the listener down into themselves and, at the same time, into the music--allowing for careful focus and free thought.<br />The only song I really don't care for is &quot;This is the Picture.&quot; It is just kind of weird, and compared to the other songs, it is weak.<br />Gabriel worked with some pretty heavy hitters on &quot;So.&quot; It is co-produced by Gabriel and Daniel Lanois (who produced some of U2's greatest albums). David Rhodes (from the Police), Kate Bush, and Youssou N'dour all make appearances here.<br />If you want some great music, look no farther than &quot;So.&quot; I highly recommend this disc.and cultures that have become cynical and abusive.<br />&quot;Red Rain&quot; (a pretty decent song in its own right) serves as a good opener to the disc.

B001PJRAUS|1|I was looking forward to this Austen adventure. It sounded like a lot of fun, a girl from modern times switching places with Elizabeth Bennett. It was fun seeing Austen's world through the eyes of a \\"modern\\" girl. However, I thought they made Amanda a little too modern. I didn't care for her personiality or her bluntness. I thought she was a little to brash and could not see why any of the leading men (Mr. Bingley, Mr. Whickham and Mr. Darcy) would fall for her. I was disappointed in the changes made to certain characters, I didn't mind plot changes (which would happen if someone interferred the way Amanda did), but I was sad that some of the characters personalities were totally altered. Still trying to figure out how Mr. Whickham ends up being a good guy and Mr. Darcy the jerk? Georgiana and Caroline had massive character changes and Mr. Bingley is kind of a creep. I think Jane Austen would be disappointed in the changes that were made.

1416589473|4|I've been playing Guild Wars for quite some time.  This book was a fun read because it showed tidbits of the world after you had played in it.  I personally quite liked it.
B000BYA5GO|2|Great Acting by all who were involved -------- subject matter - violent!  Language was offensive!  Do these guys [and females] ever grow up and become more literate?  Sad to realize that this goes on in this world.  Probably a great terrorist supplier.    Based on actual facts? More than likely true.  The content is something we would like to deny - the ending, probably happens all the time.    Hate the thought that some of our government officials are that corrupt.    I got the message but can't say that I enjoyed the movie - will not keep, what a waste.

Cute characters and cool interpolated 2d animations that seem to use shearing and maybe non uniform scaling on bit maps for added effect?  It works well.<br /><br />Definitely worth it.

B00003CWOL|3|Hard to decribe this movie. It seems to have a serious point to make about religion: at lot of the dialogue appears to be diatribe rather than interaction. But it is all wrapped up in a bizarre story line and some  pretty wierd characters. The best way I can describe it as modern  Shakespeare which I suppose is one hell of a complement to Kevin  Smith.<br />The story is about two angels cast out of heaven (played by Matt  Damon and Ben Affleck) who have found a loophole that allows them to  return. However, if they do, it will be the end of the World. This is all a  set up by another angel, Azrael (played by Jason Lee) who wants the world  to end because he has been cast into hell. The only person who can save the  world is a Scion played by Linda Fiorentina (who I do not think does a  confused character as well as she does a manipulative one).<br />Of course  there is lots more, a campy Alan Rickman, Chris Rock (almost playing  himself) as the 13th apostle (removed from the bible because he is black)  and Salma Hayek (gorgeous as ever)together with Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith  reprising their roles as Jay and Silent Bob.<br />What you get is an uneven  mish mash. When it is good, it is brilliant, but Smith's quirky style  unfortunately sometime detracts rather than adds to the story as it most  certainly did in Clerks. <br />You are best making your own mind up and  contemplating Alanis Morrisette as God. Watch it and see what you think.

B001NLKXK2|4|I was very interested in this book when insane that it dealt with Alzheimer's disease. My grandfather was diagnosed in 2006 and lived with the horrible disease until last year. It was heart-wrenching to watch him go through it. This book really put things into perspective for me. It really showed the patient side of the disease and what they really go through. Alice is such a strong woman who fights to keep winning against Alzheimer's but slowly loses. A heart warming story of Alice, her journey with the disease and the love and support of her family!
B005IGVYUG|5|This is a really good record. The fans have to love it and it is easier on the ears for the \\"nonbelievers\\". I would say that the songs contain melodies more \\"understandable\\" for the general public. ¿Could this record be the \\"Raindogs\\" of this decade? It has beautiful songs.
B00FKF0F3C|5|Excellent
0385349947|5|As a female executive for many years (but certainly not at the level of the author), I identified with so many of the examples of how women have somehow felt and acted uninvited (leaning out) even when they are among the few included in male executive circles.  The same behaviors celebrated in successful male executives are penalized for females.  I appreciate that there was none of the typical male bashing, but more of an inclusive education and suggestions for how we can all come together (lean in) to continue to improve the life sharing for both genders and all career and home choices.  Extremely well written and direct - easy to read.

0307237699|5|For reasons endemic to online commentary of a politically charged nature, I find that too many of the reviews posted here neglect to value the simple fact that this book is a good, solid read.  Lucid, forthright, and deeply engaging, The Audacity of Hope is a commendable piece of writing not only by \\"the junior senator from Illinois\\" but *within* the longstanding genre of American political biography.  For that reason in particular, I recommend this book to anyone interested in civic understanding, U.S. history, and the life of a reflective, conscientious man. <br /> <br />In our culture of mass-mediated, \\"winner-take-all\\" political partisanship, it's distressing to see folks' reading *determined* by ideological position-taking at the outset.  This book resists such a mode of reading.  To be sure, The Audacity of Hope lays out certain of Senator Obama's own political, cultural, and moral positions (while duly respecting those of his colleagues and detractors).  But this book ultimately has a higher aim: that of fostering debate among *all* Americans by raising important political, cultural, and moral issues in a sincere, forthright manner. <br /> <br />I've not encountered a recent political biography more thoroughly committed to the idea that what's important in our culture of reading is making political debate open, meaningful (not reduced to soundbites), and accessible to all (written in a non-patronizing yet intelligent fashion).  In its very narrative style, then, The Audacity of Hope reflects Senator Obama's stated desire to avoid partisan bickering and to help U.S. political discourse return to its genuinely democratic roots. <br /> <br />So pick up this book for the anecdotes (one of my favorites involves Senator Obama meeting Senator Robert Byrd for the first time in Washington); pick it up for a civic education; and pick it up for honest debate.  But don't pick it up to unilaterally impose your politics on it: reading this book encourages reflection and meaningful debate, not rehearsing the undemocratic vitriol that pollutes our airwaves more and more each day.
0307588378|3|A &#34;weak&#34; #3 in rating.  Not my cup of tea I fear, although everyone seemed to like it alot.<br /><br />Perhaps women liked it better than men?<br /><br />Good writing I thought, but an unlikely story a...problem I often encounter with fiction.
B004U52VPS|5|They played by the riles but the game pieces are flexible enough to allow for a little imagination. Easy to learn and play.
B000001ES9|4|For a debut album, this is a different, but still a good energetic release. They don't do half bad without Peart. The songs are pretty simple and basic and a bit silly, but they still rock really hard. The only song that made me want to listen to this was the track &quot;Working Man&quot; because I had heard it played a lot on the radio and thought it was a really cool tune. It's the only song that's really classic on here since this album was without Neil Peart. You kind of wonder what kind of albums they might have made if Peart had never joined the band. The songs &quot;Take A Friend&quot;, &quot;Finding My Way&quot;, and &quot;What Your Doing&quot; are pretty cool tunes also. There is definitely no mysticism on this debut, but bad boy Peart would soon come to the rescue, and all Rush fans are glad of that. Enjoy!!!
B00C8S9W0G|5|In typical Galbaldon fashion we are taken through the American revolution. The Fraser familily reunions and growth along with their trials and tribulations.  Very entertaining can't wait for book 9.

B00005MP58|4|Great mini series that stays true to the book. It is wonderfully portrayed and Colin Firth is just wonderful as Mr Darcy.
B009ZQC7MY|5|This was just lovely, taking us back to a time when lines were much more defined between groups of people. The costumes, story line and acting are just perfect. I especially enjoy the little details, as when the carpets were rolled back for a wedding, the maids came to wax the dance floor.<br /><br />The scenes in the prison are made to look realistic, with grubby, dirty walls and poor lighting. You can almost feel the cold, clammy atmosphere.<br /><br />Maggie Smith has absolutely the best lines!! She can say the most cutting things with a perfectly straight face! The scenes with Maggie and Shirley Mc Lane are classic!<br /><br />Can't wait for the next episode.
B000002KE2|5|I dont understand. This is their best album... This better than Master of Reality. Master of Reality, although it is great, has som parts that just..eh. This has everything you want in a heavy metal album. Long epics, good straightforward heavy ones, nice power ballads, weird effects, heavy as hell songs, nice instrumentals, and a great album closer. Oh I know, it dosen't have 'Iron Man\\" on it. Please, and sorry if I offend anyone, but Iron man's not that great. This album has it's Iron Man. Under the Sun is that song. It's got everything. Good evil riffs, and a nice ending, with good vocals. Even FX is a good song, if you can call it that. Cornucopia is one of their unknown classics. Good stuff. Yet everyone loves (gasp) \\"Snowblind\\" or \\"Changes.\\" Those songs are good, but nothing like Supernaut or Wheels of Confusion. BLACK SABBATH FANS GET THIS ALBUM!
0876855575|5|This book told it all.  I have a deep and smoldering affection for Charles Bukowski and his work, all because of THIS BOOK.  I don't recommend Hank to anyone because he is addictive as heroin.  You'll hate him to death and  need to read more.

B007HJ84ZK|5|First time watching Game of Thrones,and I was apprehensive,as I always am with anything popular but...wow...Just wow. Engaging & mature story. Deep & intelligent. Intriguing and genuinely likable characters. I was mesmerized,and this is coming from someone pretty much jaded by modern television!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this show to anyone who appreciates dark fantasy.
B007A4SDCG|3|Amazing advice, but applied to this extreme it will ruin your life. Got a bit weird at times.<br /><br />Read it, and apply it during your working hours, but be able to turn off the system so you can have a normal life and be there for your family.<br /><br />I found a dozen quotes I absolutely love. But man. It's OK to take time off from writing and have a life.

1451697384|3|While Klein may make some accurate observations in her book, she is nevertheless still trapped in the same old tired, hackneyed Marxist habit of conflating any and all crises which occur in the world with a crisis of capitalism.  For her, everything that happens on planet earth is filtered through the lens of Marxism, and everything bad that happens on the planet is caused by capitalism.  Perhaps this is a compensatory reaction to the opposite tendency, attributing everything good that happens on the planet to capitalism.  But her Manichean dialectic is nevertheless a distortion.    There are actually three crises confronting us today:    1)  The crisis of global warming.  2)  The crisis of the depletion and scarcity of natural resources.  3)  The crisis of capitalism.    The crisis of capitalism is the least of these three, and would occur even without the other two, as happened between 1870 and 1945.  Klein gets her causality backwards, arguing that the crisis of capitalism is what is causing global warming.  To the contrary, it is the crisis of global warming which is exacerbating the crisis of capitalism, and makes the current crisis of capitalism to be, in my opionion, unsolvable.    An article which appeared in the Financial Times, \\"German coal use at highest level since 1990,\\" identifies the real dilemma.  It is not capitalism vs. the climate, as Klein asserts.  To the contrary, as the article states it is \\"maintaining commitments to green energy\\" vs. \\"controlling the costs and protecting economic competitiveness.\\"  It is not capitalism vs. the climate.  It is the economy vs. the climate.    Contrary to what green Utopians claim, it's four or five times more expensive to generate electricity with solar panels than with fossil fuels.  And then there's the dependability problem.  With wind and solar, when there's no wind or sun, or when there's ice or snow, there's no energy.  Fossil fuel then becomes the power of last resort.  Unless people are content to do without power during long periods of time, a fossil fuel back-up is necessary.  Constructing and maintaining this back-up system is not free, regardless of what the green Utopians say.    Another estimated $1 trillion is needed to update Europe's electrical power grid to make it compatible with decentralized wind and solar power generation.    The reason fossil fuels are preferred over renewables is not because of some capitalist conspiracy.  It is because fossil fuels (sans externalized costs) are cheaper than renewables.  And while the increased costs of renewables is immediate and palpable, the externalized costs of fossil fuels are in the future and are still quite abstract.    A classical Marxist or Keynesian crisis of over-accumulation of capital or of under-consumption is a very different crisis than the the other two crises that confront us today.  And all the blame for people's desire to consume cannot be laid at the door of capitalism.  The ostentatious displays of oppulence by priests and kings existed well before the advent of capitalism.  The only difference between then and now is that winning the fossil fuel energy lottery made that sort of lifestyle accessible to the many, at least in the first world.
B006LSZECO|4|I really enjoyed this book, and you definitely could not guess what was going to happen! It was well written and intriguing, and the characters drew you in and even if you did not like them you could not help but want to know what was going to happen to them. I had a hard time with the back and forth between the diary of the wife and the husband, but it all came together in a way that I understood why they had to do it that way which made me appreciate it even more.

0312427999|5|I am a historian, and must admit that the very best book on modern world history (the last 60 years or so) is by a journalist.  Naomi Klein's &#34;Shock Doctrine&#34; is so well-written, so thoroughly-researched, and so deeply and disturbingly well-though-out, that it leaves all other historical, political, and economic writings in the dust.  Klein's analyses of what really runs today's world are succinct, cogent, and bracingly enjoyable to read.  Every chapter had at least one spot where I had to put the book down, and exclaim &#34;Wow!  Why didn't I think of that?&#34;  If you have any interest in the present state of the world, and how it got that way, you must read this book.

B000JMKTLO|5|I was stunned by the psychodrama.
B000002MZ6|5|I picked this cd almost randomly out of a catalog, not knowing anything about the recording or the musician Mike Oldfield. But after giving it a few listens, I quickly realized that this is one of the better cds out of the hundreds I own! Aside from the very creative arrangements and fresh style of the music (which relies heavily on synthetic sounds and samples), one aspect of the music that I enjoy is what I perceive to be an interplay between very earthy or soulful sounds (such as tribal chants and distant voices) with more futuristic synthetic sounds. This duality seems to bring out from me an awareness of what is sacred here on earth, as well as what life could be like outside of our beautiful planet. And the fact that a piece of music could actually induce me to contemplate such things is worth 5 stars in and of itself!<br />Finally, if someone asked me to classify this music, I really wouldn't know how, other than to put it in the category of &quot;great music&quot;. In any case, I will be paying much closer attention to Mike Oldfield's music in the distant future.
B000084T18|2|I got this CD a couple of years ago when 50 came out and everyone was sayin' he is sick and all that. When i first heard \\"In Da Club\\" i thought it was great, even if I don't now, so I bought it and when I played it on my cd player I thought it was good. I'll tell you what I think NOW<br /><br />The thing I don't really like about 50 is he is to commercial and raps about the same thing like P*ssy lickin, bling and how he got shot 9 times (even though he probably didn't) The song \\"Wanksta\\" must of been about himself cause he ain't a gangsta, he is a p*ssy MTV rapper. True hip hop heads know this is fake, most people I know like Pop Rap cause they probably haven't heard better.<br /><br />Another thing I don't like is his voice, it's damn annoying, he ain't got any skills either, his lyrics are sh*t too. The beats are tight tho.<br /><br />The only tracks I like are \\"Patiently Waiting\\" and \\"Heat\\" the rest is garbage, \\"21 Questions\\" is my least favorite and \\"PIMP\\" get on my nerves. Overall I wouldn't recommend this to hip hop heads but to Fake Rap lovers who also like Chingy, Nelly and all those.<br /><br />Instead you should buy GZA \\"Liquid Swords\\", NWA \\"Straight Outta Compton\\" or anything better than this.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5|Author admits there are preciously few facts to piece together into a story, yet describing Jesus's activities In light of The Jew's struggle against Rome explains much about who Jesus's was, as a man and an individual that walked the face of the Earth.  The thesis that Christianity has its basis, not in Jesus, but in Paul's radical and unorthodox views (unorthodox in relation to Jesus' brother James' views, who became the leader of the Christian movement within the Jewish religion after Jesus' death) makes good sense.  Paul created a religion divorced from the Jewish peasant and revolutionary who was Jesus the man that was more acceptable to Gentiles and to the Roman mindset.  After the razing of the temple in Jerusalem in 70 CE, all connection with the factual past of Jesus' life was severed. The book explains a lot, helping clarify that which always seemed bizarre or paradoxical in descriptions of the life of Jesus as set down in the gospels.
B001FBSMW6|4|What to expect from a band who already released the perfect Brit-pop album ([[ASIN:B000A2WPD8 Hopes & Fears]]), then who darkened and deepened that formula for their very good (if not quite perfect) follow up [[ASIN:184609643X Under the Iron Sea]]?  Well, I'm not sure that this album was what anyone was expecting...but it has much of the brilliance that these boys are capable of delivering.    It has already been noted by other reviewers that the first 5 songs are very influenced by the 80's.  At worst, it is just a bit confusing: witness the third track \\"Better Than This\\"--gone are the pianos, replaced almost completely by synths, all detuned slightly.  I hear hints of Oingo Boingo here, and I'm not sure if that is good.  At best, it produces some really effective pop music--the synth intro of Again and Again sounds much more like an homage to the 80's than a pastiche.      On the best tracks of the album, the neo-80's influences meld beautifully with the honest piano driven melodies into a synthesis that is greater than the sum of its parts.  The title track is one of the finest examples of this.  Just when you are getting into a very comfortable groove on the song, the bittersweet bridge kicks in and smacks you in the face with why you loved this band in the first place.      There are definitely some tracks for those who long for the soaring melodies and purity of voice found throughout the first album.  The title track, to which I have already alluded, is really a standout in the melody department.  The final track on the album is also quite lovely, reminiscent of a simpler version of Keane.    Lyrically, the whole album has a lot to offer.  The title track is haunting in its understanding of the challenges of modern life, juxtaposing melodic beauty with the disjointed feeling that technology can give.  \\"I dream in emails, worn out phrases\\", Tom intones, \\"My life, my life, just empty pages...\\".  On You Don't See Me, he practically begs the hearer to see what isgoing on around them, instead of having the moment to moment move too fast to hold: \\"Moving at the speed of life, reflected in each others eyes, but you're moving so fast in this beautiful scene, you don't see me...\\"    This is a very fine album by a group that can probably turn out very fine music without trying very hard, and if you catch a bit of criticism there, well, it is just because I know that Very Good is not quite as good as they can deliver.  I expect a lot of these guys, as I know they can give it.  I definitely found much to love in this album--I applaud them their experimentation, the desire to stretch themselves musically--I think that this desire will keep them a viable band for a much longer time than simply repeating the formula of their first album.  The songwriting is good, and the melodies are strong and interesting.  Even so, there are some definite missteps here: Tom's voice sounds strained at times, the 80's instrumentation on the first half of the album does not work completely, and the decreased emphasis on the piano may not be their absolute best idea ever, but repeat listens prove even the missteps have their charm.  This album is definitely not for those who love only the first album.  This album is also not for someone looking for a clone of [[ASIN:184609643X Under the Iron Sea]].  This is an excellent album for the fan who is committed to following the band develop over time, who believe in the power of these guys to move them emotionally.  If you approach this album with an open mind and a willing ear, you will not be disappointed and you may find some moments to genuinely love.

B003XF1XOQ|3|The weakest book of the trilogy. I wanted to know what happens at the end, and as most people, to Peeta, who was, in my opinion the core of the book, not Katniss. He was the strong, good center that held it all together and made me come back for more. If not for him, I would gave up halfway through second book. Kinda makes me wish he was the MC instead of cray cray Katniss. But that's jut me.<br /><br />Katniss is more unhinged, weird and down right nuts at this point. Not much new, but to keep pushing Katniss with an obvious PTSD syndrome into the front line of war, make her fight and to even give her weapons is purely insane. What is even more strange, is how Peeta (the only lovable and relatable characters in this whole story) got abused under the pen of Ms. Collins. Just sad.<br /><br />I was devastated by the ending (and I get it, it was supposed to be sensless slaughter, which it was). I liked who Katniss kills at the end and the reason why, but her ending is wrapped too neatly, which I didn't believe for a second. It felt too perfect, too good to be true, even though Katniss and Peeta deserve the happy ending, I felt cheated. Katniss is affected by both Hunger Games and the final war more than anyone, acting like a complete lunatic through two books, just to have her retire happily with Peeta and children like one big happy family? I don't buy that.<br /><br />The writing was great - as usual, the pacing and the story progress rather slow for this being the final book. Overall quite dissapointed, especially for who had to die to let us know how pointless war is.
1607060027|5|This book is perfect for me as a latecomer to Walking Dead. I do not have any issues prior to #70. I have since purchased all of the trade papers to go back to the start of the series. These do not contain the cover art for any of the issues. So this book gives me, at a very reasonable price, the opportunity to enjoy all of those old covers. The commentaries are a wonderful bonus. Very satisfied.
B000QRIGLC|5|This book (as well as the movie) are absolutely awesome and eye-opening. These brave men and women write a blank check to our country and its' citizens to include the ultimate sacrifice (death), to protect our freedoms!! In the &#34;memo&#34; section, they could write &#34;For Liberty&#34;!! This book outlines the road to becoming a Navy SEAL and what they endure to reach that goal. In Marcus Luttrell's written account, he shared with us the bravery and perseverance of these 4 brave souls, even when mortally wounded, three of which gave the ultimate sacrifice.

B003TJR2HS|5|I recently purchased a 2009 Infiniti G37x which has the factory stereo and iPod adapter that won't charge newer iPods and iPhones.  This adapter works perfectly with the system and allows me to charge my iPhone 4S while listening to audio.

B00D6M86RS|2|I have a basement full of pinball machines and love playing them... it's never the same game twice.  The problem with computer pinballs is the physics of the ball, and eventually you will figure out the \\"patterns\\".  This game lack true pinball physics.  The ball feels like it's made of cotton candy, not steel, and behaves the same way.  For Kindle \\"Pinball Arcade\\" is true to the real tables and much more fun... and the ball actually looks and \\"feels\\" like a pinball.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|dont get.<br />worst move in my life.<br />its like being sucked into a black hole,<br />bad idea.<br />my whole life is ruined by this game.

B00005V9HH|5|The Usual Suspects wasn't like anything usual or anything I ever suspected or expected. It had been out for some time by the time I'd finally seen it. My ex was shocked beyond belief I'd never watched it, so he sat me down and made me watch it. He & I are still friends so even to this day, I still thank him for introducing me to this amazing movie. Plenty of other reviewers have detailed the plot. Even if this isn't the usual kind of movie you'd tend to grab off the rack, just do it. You won't be disappointed. It's captivating and smart and the ending is awesome. No matter how many times I watch it, I still adore it. Kevin Spacey is amazing, but then again, he always is in my book.
0547848412|5|Took a bit to get into it, but a wonderful story. Anxious to see how they're translate this story onto the screen. I expect it will be difficult to surpass the book.
B002OFWG7O|5|Ive had a thing for the foo fighters for many years. It's definitely one of  the best greatest hits albums ive heard in a long time! This needs to be in your collection!
0345803485|2|I don't understand all the fuss around this book.  It wasn't terrible, but was definitely not the best I've ever read.  I understand that it's erotica, but it became very predictable with the sex scenes and it feels like the author filled in spaces where she couldn't figure out what to put with more sex (which is quite often).  Also, it feels like the author had her thesaurus sitting next to her so when she was about to write the same thing over she could figure out a bigger different word to use so readers wouldn't notice she said the same thing again.  I read it to see if it was all that and it definitely was not.
B008Y6U5AM|3|It was ok
B00FAPF5U0|2|Great game; but waiting 30 minutes for another life stinks; and because my rating wasnt five stars you insist on uunnessasary wording.
B00F1W1SQW|4|another awesome dream theater dvd,love all the extra content and sometimes is my favorite part of a dvd to see what goes on behind the scenes.!,,,however i knocked a star off for the constant camera switching..(video producers take note:we are musicans that watch these videos and really want to watch what the guitar,drummer etc.is doing...the constant camera antics is very disturbing at times,,,i would suggest adding a menu item that allows the viewer to pick the guy they want to see in an isolated view) otherwise this is a fantastic dvd..audio production is really good as well...progressive metal rules!!
B004MC8CA2|5|great app. multiple functions that are easy to use. I'm not a big religious person, but this app has been useful.
B00MASEK74|5|I enjoyed Season 8, and I hope the writers will stick with Capaldi.  He's been an excellent curmudgeon, and Jenna Coleman did some great work.  I was expecting more from the Danny Pink storyline, but maybe that's still in the Christmas stocking.

B001EC3JME|5|I have been using this holster for over five years now on a regular basis and its great. It twists to point any of the eight direction you want and it clips very securely onto your belt \\"it will not accidentally fall off and get lost\\". I made an elastic headband out of some pants suspenders that I got from the thrift store for a couple bucks and put this holster on the wide and thick belt sized elastic and made it into a headlight holster and it works perfectly.<br /><br />I have been using my larger X2 Inova flashlight and it worked well, but the light is big so it flopped around when I turned my head, so I got the small X1 Inova flashlight and it fits in perfectly as well, but it doesn't fit in the main compartment, you have to push it in behind the main compartment where big flashlights can't fit but skinny smaller flashlights fit in perfectly and the smaller flashlight doesn't flop around with your head movement because its so lite weight.<br /><br />I also put my Fenix E11 in that smaller compartment and it holds perfectly as well. Then you can turn the holster any of the eight directions that the holster clicks into that you want.<br /><br />Update<br />I now have went on to use the zebralight H600 headlight and it has replaced every light that I own. It takes panasonic orbtronic 18650 lithium rechargeable batteries. It has a great run time of 2 hours on high which is 1020 lumens and on medium and low the run times just drastically improve.<br />They're super bright lights.<br />Check them out on youtube: Zebralight H602w and H600w MKII beamshot

B003V6L94Q|5|Loved this great selection of songs!  Purchased for some favorites included and found other selections equally enjoyable! Have always enjoyed listening to this band and glad to finally have a way to enjoy their sound all the time.
B006BGZJJ4|5|I have an early Kindle and loaned it to someone who lost the cord. Amazon responded quickly to my dilemma, their tech staff was ultra helpful, and my Kindle was back in service almost before the battery ran out.
B00A8SPNYW|3|It was fun for the first few levels. But once you get stuck, you can't really figure out what to do since there are no instructions at all on controlling the game. So I would suggest to add a screen with instructions on how to do more advanced controls, or be more informative with the animated examples which I didn't find intuitive at all. I'm glad I didn't pay for this. It needs more work before it's professional enough to be a paid app. Thanks for the sample!
B000N6TYLW|5|My wife loves this show, she now owns the complete series. Amazon had great prices and the shipping was what we expected.
B00FAPF5U0|4|This is a great way to pass the time while my kids are at practice.
B002SCF6CA|5|I love the ridiculous so i can easily watch this over and over. Great cast for silliness. Heart warming fun.
B009AMALLM|3|Not the best entry this film kinda took a step backwards from 3
B0089LOG02|4|A wonderful read - another insight to the history of America. Quite hard to believe that such things happened. A tragic story.
B009DCOU9S|4|Nice game enjoyed the puzzles, could've had better animations, but the graphics are decent. I think some of the characters are very strange, but the story line is okay.
B00B3HJMLM|5|Great CD... Highly recommended
B00CRR5YA0|5|My only complaint with this as well as the soundtrack of the 2009 movie is the length and quantity of tracks on the album. The tracks are short and there could be more of them. All of the basic character and situation themes are present (some similar ones from 2009 evolved or elaborated on) here, but only in their infant forms.It would be nice to hear more of the nuances of each of the songs fleshed out as they were in the actual movie. Otherwise, a very great album.
B0007Y4TVU|4|Wow.  System of a Down's latest album is a glaring, critical look at politics in the modern world.  This band is unafraid to challenge the system, and they generally come out sounding great.  Not only is their music of top-quality in a world of cookie-cutter \\"I hate the world and everything in it\\" bands, but it's also bone-crunching and harmonious at the same time.  The lyrics to most of the songs are darkly satirical and blatently outraged. <br />  Top tracks include: B.Y.O.B. (a scathing indictment of Bush politics and the war in Iraq), Cigaro (a tune that seems inane at first, but give it a second listen), Question! (a haunting song about death), and Sad Statue (a beautiful song about the degredation of democracy). <br />  I enjoyed this album and am looking forward to their next release: Hypnotize.
B0000BWVBD|3|Comics adapted to the big screen is a mixture of successes and failures. Some of the more rewarding, commercially and critically, were the first \\"Superman\\", \\"Conan the Barbarian, the first two Tim Burton-directed \\"Batman\\" films, \\"Blade\\", \\"The X-Men\\" and its sequel, and \\"Spiderman\\". Failures like Alec Baldwin's \\"The Spirit\\", Billy Zane's \\"The Phantom\\", Warren Beatty's \\"Dick Tracy\\", \\"Spawn\\", and the never-to-see-the-light-of-day \\"Fantastic Four\\" are prime examples that everything that looks good in comic form requires meticulous planning in order to make the transfer to the movies.<br />Where does \\"The Hulk\\" fall?

B00005Q45W|5|I've been a Leonard Cohen fan since seeing &quot;McCabe and Mrs. Miller&quot; 30 years ago. The songs he is writing and singing<BR>at nearly 70 year of age are every bit as appealing to me<BR>as his earlier work.
0670025593|5|I absolutely have loved this series and was so excited to receive the final book to figure out the answers to all the questions posed throughout the first two and The Book of Life definitely supplied those answers for me. Honestly, I don't think there's much else to say in this review because if you've read the first two, you probably don't even need a full review of the third--you're just going to pick it up. All you need to know is it's a 5-star book, like the first two, and you'll love it.
B00BWJ7LYG|3|Don't get me wrong, this movie was beautifully crafted, imaginative and featured some great actors.<br /><br />It was also confusing. And looooonnnggg.<br /><br />We have watched the &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; trilogy. I am not a devotee, but I enjoyed them. The story did move along. In &#34;The Hobbit,&#34; I think you had to have read the books a few dozen times to follow what was happening.<br /><br />I suspect this is a minority opinion. But I really think the filmmakers are working hard to cram one movie's worth of content into three films. Ka-ching!!!!!
B005EHILV4|5|Works great with Karaoke Mics and a Lap Top. Did everything I needed to mix the two.<br /><br />Bought with: Audio2000s Awm6112 VHF Dual Channel Rechargeable Wireless Mics
0451230620|5|What an idiot I am.  I never read this because I've seen the movie.  But this is a great thriller action packed short story.       This books just reinforces King is the thriller master.    (on a side note - also showcases the talent screen writers have to be able to to adapt a short story to a film and not copy the book.)    They are not the same story, but have the same premise.      Sit back and enjoy.
B00B7Y0206|4|Tube is very good it features is entertaining in any subjects in which you needs. From comedy to history , and to news or tomorrow or even sports tube shows almost everything .
B000VECAC6|4|I'll assume everyone can find a review of the movie itself, and skip straight to this edition's features.     The special features were fun and entertaining, but having been spoiled by Python's special edition releases of their other films, this one comes up a little short. Though what's there (an hour featurette, the original read through of the script [with animations by Gilliam]commentary) is excellent, and the film transfer is good, it lacks all the fun bits found on the Holy Grail or the Meaning of Life special editions.    However, its the only game in town, it's an excellent film, and a great disc.
0805062971|5|This book has to be my absolute favorite. Why? you ask? Well, here's why:<br />Action Level: 7/10- There is a fair amount of adventure and peril strewn throughout the novel.<br />Romance Level: 8/10- There is a well  developed relationship between the characters.<br />Satirical Value: 9/10-  This book has hilarious satire value.<br />Plot Twist: 10/10- This was the  *best* twist possible in a novel.<br />Character Development: 7/10- The  characters underwent a major transformation that is highly  described.<br />Writing style: 8/10- Chuck writes with a unique fluidity much  similar to Vonnegut that many will enjoy.<br />Overall, I advise *everyone* to  read this novel...
B00B1ME3DQ|5|Badass CD. Just buy it.
B0002OXVDW|5|This is just a return to the Saturday movies of youth. Happy, clever and mucho talented were the MGM players.  They were definitely worth a second look.
B005ZUR724|4|OK, OK I understand some people have issues with the game but what MMO doesn't have them and for once in a long search it's a real MMO, open world, use skills and kill enemies to survive and level, and the graphics are pretty good too. It has a guild system, an auction house and a lot more. In my opinion you can't go wrong getting this if you like MMO rpg games it is great and really the only one I have seen like it for the kindle fire!
B00BVYNSLC|4|Good escapism.
B0000CD5I6|5|Reading the track list before this album's release, I got the impression it'd be primarily an oldies collection with a few instrumentals thrown in. All right, all right, I'll buy as much recycled material as the next Tull fanatic, but grumble grumble grumble...<br />What a pleasant surprise! <br />All new recordings of the old songs, and in some cases vastly different arrangements. The old standard &quot;Ring Out Solstice Bells&quot; is improved by the changes, in my opinion, and &quot;Last Man at the Party&quot; is hilarious. And the final verse of &quot;Jack Frost and the Hooded Crow&quot; has some of the most breathtaking harmonies I've heard in a long while. Clearly, real effort went into giving value for money on this one. Thanks, guys, and Merry Christmas to you, too.
B00881VLCE|5|Great but would have liked to have more pictures to do.  I enjoy wildlife, scenic and nature puzzles.  I download a lot of puzzles for my Kindle fire and the wildlife and scenic pictures are a lot of fun.  Where there are different selections (like number of pieces, turn pieces, etc.) you can drive yourself crazy with all the challenge you can give yourself.  This one is right in there.

B00OGPK4UG|5|It was good.
B0088W7VNG|5|Great show in th sg series.  My favorite characters and the pinacle of everything.  Never a dull moment.
B00004NHCC|5|This is one of my favorite recordings from my favorite trumpeter of all time: Clifford Brown.  Paired with Sarah Vaughan's low-pitched voice, Brownie's bright, crackling tone really works well.  The arrangements are clever, and the feeling is one of joy mixed with melancholic longing.<br /><br />Enough of that, though: Paul Quinichette doesn't get much attention in the media, but he's fantastic on this album--he has a smooth, melodic sound that's a nice contrast to Brown's trumpet and Herbie Mann's breathy, high-pitched flute.  You can sing his solos: always a good thing.  We all hear about Stan Getz, Lester Young, Sonny Rollins, and John Coltrane--with good reason, of course--but you can put Paul Quinichette right in there with guys like Hank Mobley, Harold Land, Don Byas, Carter Jefferson, Ralph Moore, et. al.: they're just as good, but have flown under the radar.
B008OM0EDO|1|I know that this is not supposed to be an amazing movie and I didn't have any expectations whatsoever watching this, but I think I laughed a total of maybe 3 times during the whole thing. It just wasn't my kind of comedy. The jokes were very flat and stupid and the story wasn't even enjoyable. Pretty big waste of time in my opinion so dont bother watching it unless you're a huge Sacha Baren Cohen fan. 1/5 for lack of laughs and a completely forgettable storyline.
B00006IR5S|4|Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets is a really good movie. Trough this Cd you can hear and imangine what all the witchcraft and wizardry was really about. If you liked the movie you are sure to be able to like the soundtrake by John Williams.
B00KMX5V8G|5|Fun
0316098337|5|This book, from the perspective of a 5-year old who has been isolated from the world, is fascinating. Many reviewers have said much of what I've wanted to write about confinement, abuse, etc., so I won't be redundant. What the book did highlight through the eyes of Jack was a view of the real world and the highly-sensory, confusing messages that adults give each other and children. Many held beliefs from \\"Ma's\\" family were a bit disconcerting; the old adage that this is the way it is, etc. How would this boy even comprehend? That's what will stay with me. A definite must read.
B00004XPPK|5|Being a film noir fan, I acknowledged the fact that Gilda was definately on my &quot;must-see&quot; list. But nothing had prepared me for how much I would like it!! The dialogue is...well, not top-rate, but you do you expect from a noir that's not Bogey or Robinson? It's classic, classic I tell you!  <br />  <br /> And even more importantly, the love triangle is so tightly constructed, you'll find yourself struggling for Gilda's decision even more than Glenn Ford. In fact, Hayworth's first appearance in the film is one of the most famous in Hollywood history, and in just one shot, you can tell exactly who and what she was to Ford.  <br />  <br /> Oh, and one more thing--if you happen to like classic 40s songs (like i do--especially if u heard Bacall in To Have and Have Not & the Big Sleep and liked it) you will LOVE Gilda's rendition of &quot;Put The Blame On Mame.&quot; Every film historian around knows that song, and through the slinky performance, we know that Ford is a fly caught in Gilda's sticky web.  <br />  <br /> I highly recommend this to everyone!! This is practically film noir at its greatest!!

B004LWZWGK|5|the final conclusion to the best batman trilogy, all of the other movies had their pluses and minus but this is by far the best version of batman
B000BYRCH4|4|All in all, this is a pretty good movie.  Seems like the only gripe is that when Paul Walker free drives he holds his breath for approximately 8 years.  However, they do explain in the movie that he is capable of holding his breath for 3 minutes, which is not uncommon among people who spend that much time in the water.  Fast paced and entertaining this movie will thrill nearly everyone who watches it.  Oh, that and Jessica Alba is easy on the eyes and will tempt you to hit the pause button several times.
B00APUYWYA|5|My husband and I were absolutely cracking up at this movie.  Wasn't over the top cheesy and we both really enjoyed it.
0765325950|5|I have read every single Wheel of Time book, and this ended the series very well. I believe this is exactly what Robert Jordan had envisioned for the ending before his unfortunate passing.
B00IX132IK|3|I downloaded this album for running. It definitely has tracks that keep you focused. Good beats. Good stuff.
0525953728|5|good book.
B002MQYOFW|4|Yeah, the title of my review is cheesy, sorry.  I liked the book, and for the first time in years I read it through in almost a single day.  I saw the movie first, which wasn't bad at all except I could tell I was missing details that could only come from the book.  But the movie was obviously good enough to get me to read the book.  The story has a good pace, and changes direction enough to make Katniss believable in her thoughts.  I'm going to read the other books, for sure.
B0013O123Q|4|I have know about this movie for quite some time. I even saw the rape scene on YouTube but never saw the whole move.So when I checked Amazon to see if it was available, I rented it.<br /><br />This was a tough movie to sit through. The violence even made me turn away, especially the scene with the fire extinguisher. The rape scene, when included with the whole movie, not just a youtube clip, makes it even more difficult to deal with. Sad thing is, this stuff goes on everyday around the world.<br /><br />If you can't handle violence, I wouldn't recommend this movie.
B008673ZAQ|5|I had a hard time putting this book down. As good as the first book, Bared to You. Can't wait til the next and last<br />book comes out in May.  If you like the Fifty Shades books, this is just as good.
B000MV90IU|5|What can I say. This is the classic Bullit movie with the first really awesome car chase sequence ever. It's also a pretty good movie even today.
0784010501|3|Even if you hate Madonna's music, like me (sorry, I'm a classic rock man), you can still enjoy this movie for the way it was filmed, especitally the black and white behind-the-scenes of her life during her 1990 tour.  You can simply skip the chapters of concert performances. <br /> <br />And besides, it's always great to watch Madonna act like a total slut!!!
B001706I5I|4|Good movie
B0041KKYD8|4|I know there are lots of fans of the original [[ASIN:B004BLTNL6 I Spit on Your Grave [Blu-ray]]] and if they think that it is better than this remake, I am sure it has to do with an emmotional attachment to the original. The original movie was made in the era of explotation movies. The original falls under the catagory of Sexplotation, because of the concentration on the explicit rape scene as opposed to the revenge. The remake shifts gears and does it intelligently. It shows enough of the abuse leading to the rape and the rape itself to make you cringe, but nothing to make it remotely sexually arrousing. It then concentrates on the revenge aspect.<br /><br />Jennifer makes her get away and survives for a month in the woods. A month is more than enough time to put together a plan and execute it. Her revenge kills each have to do with how she was treated by the man it is inflicted upon. As the best review of this film I have read so far (M. Mcallan) states, you learn enough about every character to care about them, whether you empathize for them or hate them. At times I rooted for Jennifer and at others times I cringed as she inflicted repayment to the men involved. The men were brutal with her and expected to kill her when they were done, so she just repays an eye for an eye.<br /><br />I watched this movie with my wife and she did not find it over done on the rape or the revenge, which is saying something because she can't take violence at all. If you go into the movie thinking it is just a rape movie glorifying rape then you are not going to like it and you shouldn't bother watching it. If you go into it thinking it is a revenge movie with a brutal subject, I think you will find it is a well made independent movie. I think the movie was made in a very believable way and enjoyed it. I gave 4 stars because it is pretty predictable, but that doesn't make a bad film.
B0051UP5NQ|3|I downloaded this app to open files I download on my phone. I have since found better alternative apps for opening files, so I do not use this one anymore.
B000O599WG|5|When Rio Bravo was released in the spring of 1959, it didn't receive the best reviews but time has proved how inspirational and timeless this movie is. Unlike most westerns at the time like the films of John Ford, it doesn't deal with moral or racial issues. Ford's deeply haunting and emotional The Searchers (1956) is an example. While director Howard Hawks' film is more fun and less dramatic, it is arguably just as personal as anything Ford ever did.<br /><br />Hawks is a director who has had a profound influence on many American and even foreign filmmakers and critics. He made films that are perceptive and witty but also because he was maybe the most versatile director at the time, his work has found a wide range of audiences. Rio Bravo continues the many themes of most Hawks' films and this time, I would argue that it comes together in the best way. From the very first scene, which is a brilliant piece of silent filmmaking, we get a clear idea who each character is and it sets up the story perfectly. We are then taken on a journey of action, adventure, comedy, romance and even drama and self discovery.<br /><br />I won't give away too much in this review because I feel that it would ruin the emotional impact. To understand this film is to understand Hawks as a storyteller who brings together a unique group of characters who are flawed but by sticking together, they can get the job done and come out stronger people. Dean Martin gives an amazing performance as a man who is fighting with the bottle, we assume that he is weak but we get an understanding to why he is struggling and also, when he holds it together, can be very quick and sharp. I've always thought that Martin plays a character that we can all relate to because we can all find ourselves in that position in life and call me sentimental but it's a moving look at any of us are capable of many things but must fight our demons in order to see it and move on.<br /><br />John Wayne is at the top of his game here, just as much as in The Searchers. He plays the sheriff in town who is in a tough situation and can't get caught up with the new girl in town. It's one of the best romances that only Hawks could pull off. They clearly don't understand each other but is obvious that they can't live without each other. We get a lot of the Hawks wit and insight on men and women as in Bringing Up Baby (1938), Only Angels Have Wings (1939) and To Have And Have Not (1944) and it's always fun to watch. Hawks was the best with romance in my opinion, he always got the best out of his actors as well.<br /><br />We see many other characters through out the film and always understand who they are. Not one dull or underdeveloped character in the whole film the way I see it. The point in this review is that Rio Bravo is the best example of what makes a strong Hollywood film, also Howard Hawks in general. Hawks always made fun movies but the characters were never not thought of and never taken for granted, they were always personal to Hawks as well. Today, big advanced special effects distract us from what makes a good movie, the story and the characters. Maybe my review is too simplistic but for me, Rio Bravo is a great movie that holds up and is still as relevant today as it ever was. Higly recommended.e, just as much as in The Searchers.

B008HJGPVO|4|I like the look and the feel of this stylus but didn't realize, because of the thick , wide bottom and working  with the smaller keyboards on the touchscreen cellphones, it had a tendency to &#34;fat-finger&#34; the letters and I would have to keep backspacing and correcting my words. Worked well with my Nexxus 7 tablet though.
B001TOD9VI|4|I really enjoyed this movie. On Blue Ray it looks fantastic. The wrestlers round table was very fun and gave a lot of insight. Even if your not a wrestling fan you need to see this movie.

B0050DIWFC|5|Could not put it down.  Loved the suspense. Thanks for a great read.
B0000C5RQF|4|I wish Amazon would allow us to give fractions of stars - this should be 4.8 stars. The negative (apart from the mysogyny endemic in the opera) is the Sarastro, who is a total waste of time. A real pity, because the rest of the cast is stellar!    Dorothea Roschman is an excellent Pamina. She sings and acts well, and despite being less than slim, is light on her feet and a delight to watch and hear most of the time.    Diana Damrau will take your breath away. Her acting is not that good, but the sheer power of her voice will rock you. Her looks, even through the grotesque make-up, adds to the general pleasure of watching her. The costumes of the Queeen of the night and of her three ladies is just perfect!    The best person on stage is Simon Keenlyside, who has taken the character of Papageno to heart, or perhaps has become the heart of Papageno. I have never seen the part so well acted and sung. The DVD is worth it for this alone. His exit scene with Papagena is so cleverly staged, you wonder why no one ever thought of it before.    A special mention must be made of the singer who takes on the role of the older of the two priests. He is an excellent actor and the interactions with Papageno are some of the best theatre on the disc.    There are things to quibble about, but who cares, this is a magnificent performance of an exquisite piece of vocal theatre
B000FBJAOG|5|I find this book fascinating because it's so well thought out. It's obvious the author knows what he's doing. The book is written out like a real manual, illustrations and all, and it actually makes sense logically to the point that if the zombie apocalypse did happen, this book could actually save your life.  This manual describes how to survive and even thrive in the event of the inevitable zombie apocalypse. It lists the different ways the dead could begin to walk and how to prolong a zombie-free world. It describes the weaknesses of the living dead and how to exploit them. It lists weapons to be considered when foghting off zombies based on usefulness, availability, and upkeep. It gives clear instructions on how to protect your house from mobs of moaning ghouls, and what other places should be considered when deciding where to take up residence. It shows you what to do to prepare for the end of the world beforehand, and what to do if if you find yourself alive but unequipped. It explains zombie psychology and how to avoid attracting them. It puts some widespread rumors to rest, like that chainsaws and flamethrowers are some pretty neat ideas. In all, it teaches you to not panic, think carefully, and kick some zombie ass.
B000058983|4|Originally released in 1967, this was the band's third effort. 'Forever Changes' appears to be one of rock & roll's all-time most under rated lp's. Probably because it's technically considered to be 'hippie music'. As for myself, I think of Love to be part folk rock and part psychedelic. Love's two main members are vocalists / guitarists Arthur Lee and Bryan MacLean (R.I.P.) and IF you ask me, I sort of believe that if Jimi Hendrix were alive today, he'd be a lot like Lee. As I've listened to this reissue several times, I think I may like the seven added bonus tracks -as much- as I did the actual album. The most memorable tunes are &#34;Alone Again Or&#34;, &#34;The Red Telephone&#34;, &#34;Bummer In The Summer&#34; and the bonus cuts, &#34;You Set The Scene&#34; and &#34;Your Mind And We Belong Together&#34;, which are both extended random studio rehearsals. Nice! Should appeal to fans of Moby Grape, Airplane, Buffalo Springfield and The Zombies.
B00BTJMS1A|1|Bad, horrible, terrible game. The graphics are out of the 80's and pathetic. The sounds are just as bad. The gameplay itself is annoying and makes little sense. Avoid this garbage.
B006LSZECO|1|The beginning was slow moving but a friend encouraged me not to stop reading it. The activity picked up and the intent of the characters became clear. I do not like stories that the author does not bring closure to. I feel cheated.
B000XUBFE2|5|One the best books I've read in a long time. The way it's written...from death point of view, is amazing. It's pure genius. The author is able to jump around from situation to situation so flawlessly, which is something a lot of authors don't do well. He tells this story in a way that makes you feel like the narrator is sitting right beside you. You can see the tired lines on his face. Hear the sadness in his voice. This is one for the ages folks. And one last note...have tissue ready for the ends folks.

B002YIHO7I|5|The CD for Soldier of Love is by far, yet another of Sade's finest moments.  As deep and sensitive as her thoughts go, this music yearns and stays with you.  I find myself humming or harmonizing as I work through my day.  I am captivated and moved by \\"The Safest Place\\", a magnificent work of genius, for anyone who has ever felt the emotion of love.  It reminded me of a dream that I once had, of love lost and preserved in my heart. \\"Soldier of Love\\" grabs your soul and beckons a call for Love, waiting, and watching...until you find someone new.  It's all a journey that transpires into a tug-of-war with your emotions of love and trying to understand the reasons why we fail or succeed.  I was completely intrigued and moved.
B00003CXZ4|5|I've been flipping through the one-star reviews for this movie (more than I would have expected) and there are a few themes which are repeated in these viewers' complaints:<BR>- There was a predominant artsy-fartsy, pseudo-intellectual air about the film.<BR>- &quot;I couldn't follow it!&quot;<BR>- The ending stunk.<BR>- We don't really find out what we want to find out (i.e. that the main character is an unblemished hero).<br />Here's my response to these thoughts, because I would hope that these poor reviews won't deter people from experiencing this movie: <br />Yes, there's probably a artsy sort of pseudo-intellectual thing going on here. That comes from the pseudo-intellectuals themselves, however, so they can choose how to view it if they like, and you can do your own thing. If there's one thing you should pick up from this movie, it's the idea of perception being reality, so if you get yourself caught up in the artsy-fartsy intellectualism, you'll probably concede your chances of enjoying the movie. It's a movie, not a textbook... enjoy it, don't take it too seriously.<br />If you can't follow the plot... I can't help you there. You might want to consult your doctor about a possible ADD affliction, though. <br />If you had a problem with the ending, well, you're not alone. I loved this movie, but when I watched it the first time I was pretty disappointed with the ending. I guess it comes from our &quot;big Hollywood film&quot; conditioning- there's always gotta be something at the end. I contend, as everyone else does, that this film defies convention. I, however, believe it defies convention in other ways aside from the obvious &quot;back-to-front&quot; presentation. We're slapped with an ending which is neither tragic nor joyous. It's just kind of there. What you make of it is up to you. If you choose to take the 21st century prepackaged hyper-caffeinated approach, then you may find the ending to be completely lacking any substance. On the other hand, if youkeep your mind open (and it should be WIDE open after 90 minutes of this brain-twister) you might find something else. I won't tell you what to find; if I did, I'd be one of the same pretentious, self-appointed intellectuals that draw the ire of a typical average Joe moviegoer. <br />Finally, what I enjoy most about this movie is the character development. I read a complaint that we never get a grasp of who each character truly is. I think that's true, but I think that's what makes it great. There can be poor character development which makes us wonder who is who and renders us unable to discern between good and evil, and then there can be brilliant character development which aims to erase the fast food mentality of black and white, prepackaged archetypes and the like. I'm not sure anything in this movie is necessarily brilliant, but I do enjoy the fact that we DON'T know the characters and their integrity. What we're left with is an introspective on truth in relation to perception. We're also reminded that guaging human morality is a fudgy proposition- we know what we're supposed to do, but even the best of us aren't always inclined to do so. Each of the three characters who are the main foci of this movie are difficult to read- are they friend or enemy? Are they rife with malicious intent, or are they ordinary people put in extroardinary situations in which they must conduct themselves with less-than-admirable behaviors? It is painful to some viewers that they can not differentiate between hero and villain, and that may be why this movie is not for everyone. Whatever the case may be, you are cheating yourself if you don't give this movie a fair shake. It is a tremendous movie which will surprise and shock you as well as make you think. <br />Of course, I could just be full of it too.
B0025TAHPC|5|I enjoy the characters very much! They are easy enough for me to relate to in the generation x meets middle-ish age and and try to be adults, but we just aren't the middle age that our parents were! It's irreverent always and i adore that!
B006LSZECO|5|Okay the first reason to get this book is the authors writing style which I just absolutely loved. She had more clever lines in this book than I've read in a long time. Secondly get it for the plot which is just a gas. This book has more twists and turns than a Twizzler! I like her writing style so much that I have started Dark Places, her first book.
B000N2HBSO|4|I purchased this book after seeing the movie and really enjoying it.  I'm not a big into history or reading about it but DKG is well respected and the subject matter clicked with me.  So at over 900 pages, this isn't for the faint of heart - reading it is a definite project, not summer book-candy.  DKG brings as much insight and style to the personalities as I've ever seen and the result is a very readable, engaging book that will educate you not only about Lincoln, but the characters around him.<br /><br />One by-product of the book IMO is the learning I'm getting about life in the mid-19th century.  people's perceptions, attitudes, beliefs and customs are eye opening and make me think that we've lost much in the rush to productivity and the electronic age.  These little glimpses into a lifestyle long past are perhaps my greatest pleasure in reading Team of Rivals.<br /><br />I encourage you to read it if you have an interest in the subject matter and want something a little more weighty to sink your teeth into.
B00DPM7TIG|5|I loved this book!

B002POVIMS|5|I heard &#34;Bulletproof&#34; several months ago, had it stuck in my head almost constantly, but only recently decided to see what the rest of La Roux's music was like. I absolutely love this album; I have nothing bad to say about it. La Roux has a way of putting her emotions into her music and you can feel them in every song. I was afraid I wouldn't like it because I've heard a lot of people compare it to a lot of 80's music, but it's so much better than that. I can't stop listening to it. She has SUCH a great voice and I can't believe she's not more famous
B00AJMQSP0|5|Ive been a Helloween fan since1988 when I first heard them. No, im not a fanboy and love everything they've ever done. I believe they've had some rough spots in their career. But, Helloween is a band that after 20 some odd years and numerous line-up changes can still put out great records. I got this because it intrigued me. Could they still rock? The answer came in a resounding YES.This album is one of my newer favs. Going thru some of the rough spots ive gone thru in my life &#34;straight out of hell&#34; has always helped me through. I don't believe theres a bad song on it or a weak one for that matter. It goes right up there with the Keepers 1 and 2, Time of the oath and better than raw.Would highly recommend this disc to any fan of heavier music.
0061914177|2|I bought this book based on the average rating and the number of people that rated it. The description sounded good and I thought that maybe I would learn something.<br /><br />First off, I'd like to give the author credit for having passion and energy but unfortunately that's all this book has.<br /><br />The author begins by telling his audience what they'll learn throughout the book. Then he gives a brief bio. So far so good.<br /><br />After the 15th anecdote about how  business with billion dollar marketing budgets will just spontaneously find you if your provide a good product, I realized that I've been fooled.<br /><br />I know that the rating system at amazon has been going down hill, but I didn't realize that someone could keep such a high rating by an inordinately high amount of reviewers with this steaming heap.<br /><br />Anyway, the outline showed promise and if the author would have stuck to his formula about providing actual valuable information this would truly be a hit. Unfortunately it's just another case of someone making another hustle.

B00IOVH8AW|5|It seems like such a simple little ditty that just repeats itself until it's done, but it's really much more than that.  The song really IS happy, and it's hard to NOT feel happy (or at least a little brighter) when you listen to it; even when the radio stations are trying to beat it to death like they do everything they get their hands on.  It's clean, it's quite infectious, and it really is a carefree sounding pick-me-up that is well worth both the money and the time to give it a listen.
B0054R6BFM|5|This book is really different from others that I've read. Jay Asher describes the characters emotions perfectly. I could go on and on about this book, but definitely give it a read. You won't be disappointed!

Being a child of the 60's and 70's, i got everything he was talking about.  Tho, I did'nt do the drugs he did and I never drank.  Wished there were more pictures....like when he was in bands.  But, I loved the book, anyway.

B00005JOFO|5|I went to see the movie in response to the reviews and accolades it was getting, but I had never read Annie Proulx's story. Consequently, I didn't know many of the details before I went.    As the movie began, it seemed obvious that the circumstances could readily develop into a long relationship between the two young men. That it would become sexual I knew from the reviews.     But I seldom felt much of anything lovable in either one. True, they both worked hard and helped each other. What many reviewers described as Jack's furtive glances at Ennis didn't look at all libidinous to me. I thought he often looked sullen and morose. I did not see tenderness or fondness, and to this minute I don't understand what those reviewers saw that I didn't.    (Perhaps I project my own prejudices into the story. My experience is, that love builds slowly, by baby steps. A pleasing attitude, a caring demeanor, perhaps a small act of compassion observed discretely from afar - these sort of things can trigger an interest. Then comes getting to know each other. At some point, as time together increases, shared experiences unaccountably become moments to be remembered. You get the idea; back to the story.)    Weeks of  virtual isolation may indeed make any man horny, and if either one or both of the protagonists is homosexual, the result seems predictable. But their first sexual encounter simply looked to me like opportunistic sex, not love. A few reviewers have commented similarly, but went on to say that \\"it grew into love.\\" I only saw two short scenes that I interpreted as love growing.     Distressingly, the first was seen through the binoculars of their boss, Joe Aguirre, as the young men cavorted on the bare slope of the mountain, in a rough and tumble game of love tag,  hugging and kissing, unmistakably enthralled with each other. The other occurred many years later, during one of their \\"fishing trips,\\" when they jumped, naked and exhilarated, from a high bluff into the lake. Ifelt their joy in both scenes.     Trouble was, their love had been fully formed years before the swim scene, so it doesn't count as a stepping stone to love. That leaves the first scene as the only early scene that suggested growing love. But in fact, even it occurred after the tent scene.    The entire story rests on their love. If their attraction was only sexual, I don't think it could account for the ultimate, overwhelming tragedy. The author, Annie Proulx, and the screenwriters Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, postulate that the young men are in love, profoundly, unfathomably  and unspeakably in love. By the end of the movie, I agree it was so. But somehow, I didn't see love start; I didn't see love grow where I thought it should have.    Still, many of the reviewers said it was there. What I didn't know  (and wanted to know) was, did these reviewers sense it from watching the movie, or simply accept it as a given? It seemed to me that there was only one way to find out, so I bought the book and read it.    Well, the missing love development is in the book, plenty enough to satisfy me. So what was wrong? I went and saw the movie a second time.    I was wrong, thankfully wrong. Virtually everything in the book is in there, and I must admit, done to perfection. I simply hadn't understood much of what was said in the first viewing, particularly in the early scenes where Ennis and Jack get to know each other on the mountain. And of course I hadn't read the book at that point. Reading the book made all the difference in the world.    In the book, after Ennis and Jack have swapped duties as herder and camp tender, Ennis comes into camp one night for what Annie Proulx calls \\"a high-time supper.\\"  A big meal, followed by smokes and whiskey, and then talk. Annie, whose prose is amazingly lean, ticks off  a whole page of things they talk about. They must have talked for many hours (far too long for the movie). Annie says, \\"They were respectful of each other's opinions,each glad to have a companion where none had been expected.\\"  Finally, it's time for Ennis to return to the flock:    \\"Ennis, riding against the wind back to the sheep in the treacherous, drunken light, thought he'd never had such a good time, felt he could paw the white out of the moon.\\"     That was the line, just a single line, that opened the door enough to let me glimpse Ennis's heart.  After an impoverished, loveless life, someone had opened up to him, made him know his feelings were important to them. I don't know how it could have been displayed on the screen (it was not). It was, after all, just his feeling, riding alone in the moonlight. To me it was the touchstone, the first baby step to love.     I found many other small steps after that, benefiting greatly from having read the book. When the tent scene happened, it fit the story, at least in my mind.    I was surprised by my own reaction in the second viewing. Jack came through much more powerfully and sympathetically. I actually didn't like him much the first time.     And the anguish that first overwhelmed me seemed not quite so intense. Someone, in one of these posts, makes reference to \\"..the moment when Ennis decides to stop hiding from life in his work, and agrees to attend his daughter's wedding.\\" I wish. That was a bone tossed by the screenwriters to the movie audience. Annie Proulx never wrote it. What she wrote was, \\"That was about the time Jack began to appear in his dreams. Jack as he had first seen him, curly-headed and smiling...\\" Make no mistake, Annie's Ennis is sentenced to haunted dreams and regrets for the rest of his life.    The movie surely stands on its own, and that tiny ray of hope that Larry and Diana sent us doesn't seem to be a match for the enormity of the tragedy. I said it was not so intense the second time, but just writing about it brings it flooding back to me. No, I'm not over it yet.    By the way, if I forgot to mention it, this is the finest movie I've ever seen.Bob Arr
B00L9B7IKE|3|Well written, not my type of content.
B007TK77QE|1|Too many strange characters, too many social problems in all just too much.

0525423273|5|I tend to gravitate more towards urban fantasy books...but now and then, I throw those aside for something a bit more real. After reading all the positive raves about Anna and the French Kiss, I decided to give this book a try. Boy am I glad I did! First of all, as someone who has traveled to Paris more times than I can count for business (and once in a while for pleasure) and who told her husband four years ago that she was sick of the place, this book reminded me of all the wonderful things I've forgotten about the city of lights. Secondly, this book managed to do what so many other YA have tried but failed at (at least for me): remind me of what it felt like to be a teen on her own without the parental units and the glorious highs and horrid lows of first \\"real\\" love.<br /><br />Anna is a fantastic, all-too-human character who I think will appeal to most women out there. She manages to overcome her self-imposed limitations, gain some much needed maturity, and score a delightfully awesome dude in the process. As for said dude, well...I dare you not to fall in love with him yourself. Move over Edward...Etienne is just wonderful, flaws and all. But Anna and the French Kiss isn't just a book about finding yourself and true love when you least expected it; it also explores the meaning of friendship between young women and what it means to be loyal, forgiving, and kind to those you call friends. So many YA books give the barest lip service to the relationship between the heroine and other girls and instead focus on the boy/girl love angle. But this one dares to explore the complexities of friendship between women and how things don't always go smoothly even between the closest friends.<br /><br />Anyway, if you're looking for something fun yet with a streak of depth not always found in other similar books...pick this one up. C'est magnifique!

You get Pulse, <br />and you get the entire Dark side of the moon album live. <br /> <br />The lighting is awesome. Every time I see this DVD, I wish I had <br />been there.  Sometimes the lights are so bright it washes out the <br />stage, but what a show!! <br /> <br />My Live concert DVD Juke Box is growing full.  If of all the artists <br />I listen to, I could only have a single DVD and I was to be stranded <br />on a island with a home theatre system, THIS is the DVD I would pick. <br /> <br />In fact, because I have found all DVD's don't last forever and the <br />quality of the media is not all the same, I have purchased a \\"Backup copy\\"! <br />10 stars if I could,and I was not actually the biggest Floyd fan growing up....
B00IJJUIMY|5|Connelly leaves us with a cliffhanger. I like Harry's new partner.
B007J4T2G8|3|Not a believable storyline
1439148953|5|If you're going to read this book, be advised that the beginning is very slow. Toibin takes his time describing the slightest detail in tedious way. Everything from the way Rose walks to the manner in which Eilis read her letters sent from her family. To some, this might become boring, but once you're half-way into the book, you truly begin to appreciate all of those details because they all add up to the Eilis's transformation. Not only that, but you get a real sense of every character. The ending would not have caused such a deep feeling had I not known (and ultimately felt) all those details.  Colm Toibin is an amazing writer and this is a must-read. A review from The Times U.K. states that, \\"Reading Toibin is like watching an artist paint one small stroke after another until suddenly the finished picture emerges to shattering effect...\\" This, I believe, sums of the experience of reading this novel.
B0053TWV46|4|George Romero and Stephen King return with three more terrifying tales to keep you up at night! Well... Sort of... Although they are based on more of King's short stories and adapted into a screenplay by Romero, this second collection is headed by George Romero collaborator Michael Gornick, director of photography for DAY OF THE DEAD, DAWN OF THE DEAD, and the original CREEPSHOW. Their work in the past unfortunately hasn't rubbed off well on Gornick, who turns out a routine shocker that would have been better suited for television. In the first story, three would-be thieves are stopped by a vengeful wooden Indian in \\"Old Chief Wood'nhead.\\" Four friends face off against a carnivorous oil slick when they board \\"The Raft.\\" Finally, a woman pays for deadly her hit-and-run accident when the corpse of \\"The Hitchhiker\\" returns to torment her! The first and third tales are, again, routine revenge stories with a splash of blood and a touch of the supernatural. Outside of character actor George Kennedy, the performances are rather goofy in \\"Old Chief Wood'nhead,\\" with moderate effects used to bring the Chief to life. \\"The Raft\\" tends to be the most memorable, a veritable BLOB on a budget that offers several surprising moments. \\"The Hitchhiker\\" is, by far, the most horrific of the three, mainly thanks to the gruesome costume designs by Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger. While it is nowhere near as witty and fun as the original, CREEPSHOW 2 is still a worthwhile sequel for genre fans.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies
0848813618|5|Many of us found Hesse when we were searching youngsters,<br />filled with a longing that Western thought failed to fill<br />(yes, this was before the Reagan years, before crass materialism<br /> seemed to fill the spiritual void for so many waylaid Americans)<br /> Go back and reread this marvellous story of the Buddha, told<br /> in loving and respectful prose by this German master. It<br /> stands the test of time well, and opens up the door to a<br /> different way of viewing reality, as told in lyrical and<br /> loving language. There's a reason this book speaks to youth<br /> who are longing: it's elegant, simple, and rings with truth.
B00JH3S0AI|1|The highlight of this film was Scarlett Johansson nude. The rest of the movie was uninteresting with no coherent plot that did not rip off from Species.
B00LZXOI5E|5|This is a fun game. Keeps my mind entertained.
B00AIQP9DE|5|I am really liking this game so far.  I have played a few Big Fish games and this seems even more impressive so far.  The graphics are great.  What can be more fun than a mystery at a haunted carnival?!
B004MC8CA2|5|Its realy great to have the Bible available on my phone for easy access. Easy to use and read. Would recommend.
B00006FDCJ|5|Clint Eastwood is a master film maker and this movie is one of his all-time best. In fact this is one of the best Western films ever made and one of my absolute favorites.
B000NTPDSW|5|It's the godfather on BluRay... why wouldn't you buy this for your collections?! Unless you hate good movies... I don't know
0792844890|5|One of Mel Brooks' funniest movies, Spaceballs is a great spoof of Star Wars and science fiction in general, with extremely funny performances by Rick Moranis, Bill Pullman, and the rest of the cast.
B000FIMG68|5|I wasn't into this show in the beginning, but after catching up on the first season I was hooked.  With the second season of Lost, the mysteries of the island grow numerous.  Seriously...like mangos on a tree.  In this season we learn much more about the others but yet they are still a mystery (or are they?).  We learn about the hatch, its purpose on the island and the connections between it and other strange happenings on the island.  As always, the character development via flashbacks is there and actually provides a lot of insight as to why people act the way they do on the island.  Ooo we learn about Ethan's abduction of Claire (crazy stuff folks)! All in all, an excellent follow up to Season One.  If you are into action, adventure, mystery and a little bit of studying human nature, you'll like this show.
B007QA3AH2|5|Classic, funny, original, great cast.  Full of great quotable moments, and Sigourney Weaver is hot.  Thats pretty much it i think.
0439023513|5|At first I have to say I was disappointed. Since a lot of reviews already contain spoilers, I am not going to hide any detail. The protagonist doesn't follow the typical heroine defeat the bad guy and save the world formula. Instead, she was torn when she realized the side she has been fighting for is as viscous as the enemy. There is no winner. A lot of innocent people lose their lives. The weapon invention of \\"one of her boyfriends\\" kills her sister even it is just an accident. The heroine never really loves either of them as she is not ready to fall in love. Yet people all around her expect her to return their love and becomes one of their lover. The author paints a picture of human nature when survival instinct dictate. There is no super vampire power or unreal love.<br />The more I think about the story, the more I love it. We all have some point in our time have experience similar situation. There is no absolute. Paradigm can shift and the one we think we love a can turn into some strangers. I applaud the author's bravery to think outside of the box and refuses to follow other novels.<br />I am also happy at the end Peeta finally won Katniss' love even thought it wasn't a fair tale ending.
B005XQLBU4|5|Very fun and addictive
B00ESCJG1U|1|I uninstalled this app.  Here is what I don't like.  When importing a photo and Perfectly Clear does it's thing a nice wipe bar shows up on your photo.  To the left is the &#34;original&#34; and to the right is the improved version.  Well why does the &#34;original&#34; look so much worse than the original?  I can't compare it this way it is totally unfair.  This reminds me of the days when blu ray was new and the stores would put in the &#34;blu ray/DVD comparison disk&#34;.  These were usually blu ray disks that split the monitor and played clips of movies on each side of the monitor.  One labeled DVD and the other labeled Blu ray.  Well the DVD side always looked worst than the Blu ray side.  However since Blu rays were new that was the only blu ray in the store.  The rest of the TVs were playing a different disk on DVD and when compared to the Blu rays interpretation of DVD looked far better.  This is what is happening with this app.  Perfectly Clear first makes your photos worse and then seems to restore them to how they looked and then you can add certain effects.  I can do most of this with a system app that came on my phone.  I was really interested in the &#34;noise reduction&#34; feature and it did not reduce the noise (sand grain effect) that you tend to get in low light.  It did however make the original side look much worse than the original and then return the improved side to almost original.  I have a Galaxy Note 2 perhaps the camera already does the best it can do with the lighting etc.  This app did not work for me as it was described.
B00005JMYI|4|Will Ferrell comes alive in _Anchorman_, once again proving that he is one of the few talented acts to come out of the SNL machine in quite some time.  Whenever you're watching a comedy whose talent is a bit low on the sophisticated meter, you have to be enthralled by the characters and the actors who play them.  Ferrell delivers in spades and, while the plot spins around and goes nowhere, he manages to continually delight the audience with his own brand of humor.  Bottom line, if you love Will Ferrell and his style of comedy, you will love _Anchorman_.  If you don't, shop elsewhere.<br /><br />The premise of the film is a hilarious look at the power of reporters during the \\"golden age\\" of local television.  The character of Ron Burgandy is absolutely hilarious and it is a delight to see a chauvinistic icon struggle with what he views as an invasion by women in the workforce.  My only complaint with the film is the same complaint that I have with many of the comedies that are being released these days.  These comedies seem to be based off quick sketch ideas, many of which are spawned from Saturday Night Live and the like.  The problem with this formula is that many of these sketches are hard to sustain over a couple of minutes, let alone a feature length film.  One gets the impression that these films, including _Anchorman_, would be truly dynamite if they could just restrict themselves to an hour.  The \\"90 minute\\" comedy rule is just too long for these films to sustain their interest, forcing them to sag at many points.<br /><br />That being said, _Anchorman_ still receives my approval.  Each time I have seen it, I have been laughing out loud and forced to tears at a few spots.  Will Ferrell's performance is stunning and I think he is truly one of the most gifted comedic actors working these days.

B0028R3NCU|5|This item was exactly what I needed - a tiny USB micro card reader that can hide unnoticeably into my wallet.<br /><br />One thing to note: I bought this from seller Adorama Camera through Amazon where it was explained shipping was free - but I DID have to pay for shipping at my post office when the item came in. Buyer be advised!
B003ZSJ212|5|People you need to stop bashing George its his movies not ours his creation you did'nt make it up. All these changes are what he wanted but did'nt have the tech to do it at the time. These are the best quality we will ever see these films in so be happy the changes are not really that big of a deal. Darth Vader looking at palpatine while he is killing his son and then basically saying enough is enough and screaming no actually was emotionally touching I loved it my wife cried when it happenend. These Movies will never look any better get over yourself get this set its awesome.

B005ZOBNOI|5|I rarely write reviews of books, but I had to write one for this book. It was one of the best books I've ever read. To me, it is absolutely perfect.
B0089LOG02|3|I enjoyed the story. It was an easy read and a feel good ending.
B009KS4XRO|5|I like the constants. New Orleans has the best slots. Need more power ups awarded. Chat is annoying. Needs more animation or action in games. Use famous people for narration.
B0013K1ALE|4|Writing this while watching the DVD. Sound is nice. I'm more of a purist for concert videos. I want to see the band perform. Some of the \\"extra\\" clips while the band is performing is interesting-but it turns the concert video into a movie. Just show the band-Jimmy Page is the genius behind this band so let's see the guitar player play!! Love Zep-Saw them in \\"75.  The music is wonderful. At least they didn't do the cut-cut-cut-cut every 10 seconds that you see in a lot of concert videos that have been shot recently.
B009JZSC9S|5|Such a good show<br />So well-written entertaining love the characters started watching it from the beginning<br />Can't wait for season five

B00005JNBQ|1|worst movies of all time.  What we get here is a super nerd living in Idaho.  If this is how people are in Idaho I will NOT be visting soon.   <br /> <br />The acting is lifeless.  Some have found that funny but not me.  It scares & saddens me to think that Hollywood can put out this pathetic drool & people actually love it.  There is very little plot & you never develop a caring for any of the characters.  I laughed once through the whole movie.  That is a waste of 90 minutes. (180 really - read below) <br /> <br />But I will gladly spend five minutes to hopefully prevent you from buying this film.  I just saw 'Nacho Libre' it was done by the same producers & it too was AWEFUL .  Must be some bad stuff goin round Hollyweird these days because their idea of a comedy has really taken a nosedive with this movie being the biggest crash of them all. <br /> <br />The lead character has no depth of emotion.  And the other characters in the movie are but sideshows for the giant dork.  I know when I date one of my first questions will be how she liked this film. If she liked it even a little I will be heading down the road. I cannot grasp the kind of mind that finds this dribble funny.   <br /> <br />Bored out of my mind & stupified from watching this movie twice (as recommended is some ealier reviews) got me to thinking about some reviews comparing this movie to 'Welcome to the Dollhouse'.  NOT even close.  That was a FAR FAR superior movie. <br /> <br />Again I URGE you to rent this movie first.  If you like it, buy it.  If you HATE it like I did thank me in your prayers this evening.  If this is what 60 % of out country finds amusing I am truly concerned for our future as a society. <br /> <br />PS And PLEASE do NOT click the \\"Did Not Find Helpful\\" Box just because you disagreed with my opinion of this cinematic disaster.  Take it on the chin like the good nerd you are and move forward with your life...............

B00CO4GO7I|5|I don't get into very many books like I did with this one. This is a true american hero fighting for the American cause who does nothing but protects his fellow brothers in combat. He tells of his battles in life and he wasn't always the best but he give it his all. True American and a great book
B007L3BMGA|5|I tend not to subscribe to  &#34;pack leader&#34; hype so did not read this when everybody else was.To be perfectly honest I never intended reading this book at all but I'm  pleased I did.<br /><br />I read my first erotica novels about three months ago more out of curiosity than anything else. Even though I read titles billed as raunchy and dark, I was for the most part hugely disappointed that few moved me in any way at all. In fact reading the stock exchange report was more entertaining in comparison.<br /><br />Frankly I simply didn't understand what all the genre fuss was about. My own sex life which I would hardly describe as &#34;on the edge&#34; was far more exciting than what I was reading.<br /><br />I decided to read Fifty Shades because I was curious to find out whether it would be as bland. It certainly isn't.  Many may think it's easy to capture sexual tension using words but I don't believe it is.  Compare this work with most others and the difference is staggering.<br /><br />I guess the greatest impact for me has been realising that in this easy to self publish world we now live in, it's becoming more and more difficult to find genuine quality to read, no matter the genre. Unfortunately the Internet is incredibly polluted by far too many slick marketers  touting crap for a buck.<br /><br />I fully understand why this book created the stampede it did and what a shame it led to so much rubbish in its wake.
B0019N8P2W|3|I have to say I had looked forward to this release for such a long time. I was an avid fan of Daria when I was in high school, when it originally aired. I eventually found the ripped TV episodes and was satisfied. About 6 years later here we are:<br /><br />I bought this collection not knowing that the music was changed, but that I completely understand. It would have been twice as much, which I would have easily paid, but that's a moot point. What does bother me is that the quality is no different than the ripped from TV episodes. MTV/Viacom did nothing to clean anything up, or offer higher resolution, and probably didn't even use the masters from the looks of it, at least with the early seasons. The only benefit from the TV rips is that they aren't the few censored Noggin ones.<br /><br />The \\"extras\\" are by definition extra, but they aren't any sort of extra premium content one would expect.<br /><br />(This section contains Fair Use Doctrine) My biggest qualm is how the DVD tracks are put together. Since I paid for this DVD and expected to move it to my hard drive (for my own personal use), I was sorely disappointed with how Viacom wants to treat me like a criminal. Instead of a single track containing a single episode, the track includes 3-5 minutes of a few episodes, making it impossible to extract a complete episode. I was left with 22 minutes of an amalgam of 4 episodes. This gives me little incentive to stop watching my TV rips, which may sound lazy, but convenience wins when they are both of the same quality, and the TV ones also the include original music. So as to not confuse anyone, the DVDs play an episode completely, it doesn't mix anything up.<br /><br />The presentation is sub-par, but for people who don't have access to the episodes, this will satisfy your Daria craving.
0061767581|1|I love the hills. and I admire Lauren on the show, so that's why I wanted to read her book. When I got it, I thought it was going to have the same drama, that love- tranglie, friendship feeling you see on the show, but it wasn't! When I read the first 10 pages, it lacked a story, the whole story was run-on, there was no \\"drama\\" in the book.  There was so much profanity in the book, the whole story fell apart. It lacked creavity, and reading that book was like reading a bad movie you don't like. DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE AUTHERS NAME, THIS BOOK IS TRASH AND NOT WORTH READING!
0812982622|5|I don't always agree with the Pulitzer Committee, though in the case of this book and the recent \\"Olive Kitteridge\\" I feel they picked two stellar works of fiction.  I was lucky enough to encounter Adam Johnson at a reading in Iowa City last summer and his compelling presentation was enough to convince me to read his book. The subject matter is very off-putting at first and for the first 100 or so pages it is a bit of rough going for the casual reader due to the graphic material.  But once this novel gets cooking - about one-third of the way in - this reader was completely hooked and I could not put it down.  The story pulls together multiple narratives and weaves the complex lives and back stories of several different characters with the same level of mastery and finesse as a great Quentin Tarantino screenplay.  In fact, this story has a similar appeal as one of Hollywood's \\"edgier\\" blockbusters: violence, sex, mystery, politics and ultimately, redemption.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong, this is one brutal narrative.  There are moments in the text that literally made me shudder with horror (and I'm a guy who laughed his way through the \\"Saw\\" films with my 13 year old horror-obsessed son).  However, there are also some of the most tender moments and intimate sensuous details one could imagine.  Mr. Johnson displays a firm grasp of Asian culture and psychology - both in its public and private personas.  He understands what his characters value and how that contrasts, often sharply, with our own Western ideals of freedom, self-determination and individuality.  One doesn't have to have any specific background or interest in the history and politics of the DPRK (and few do) to be mesmerized and enlightened by the lives and fates of the characters in this novel.<br /><br />I can't recommend this novel highly enough to readers who love to immerse themselves in a ripping yarn well told.  In that regard, Johnson is a real master.  Nothing in this novel is to be taken asfact (even though some of it is).  But that isn't the point. The book transcends fiction and is a story about \\"telling stories.\\"  I was profoundly moved and affected by what I read here.  The subject the author is tackling is storytelling itself.  And how stories have the power to transform both the reader/listener and the storyteller.  When \\"The Interrogator\\" sits down with his parents in one of the final chapters and is determined to \\"tell them his story\\" he assumes the role of human beings in every corner of the world whose voices have been silenced by grief, loss, confusion, fear, self-doubt and a host of traumas beyond measure.  In other words, he is one of us. - JC
B0083ZRAJS|5|There are no words to describe how much this book has made me feel. It's weird that I'm reading it for the first time now that I'm 30 and it has had a huge impact on me. The movie did not do this book justice!!
B004OZOTSQ|5|Useful for transferring files to Kindle. Works as advertised.
B004132HZS|5|There's not much that can be added to the reviews here already, the casting, stories and production are all superb. The really good news is that series 2 has started in the UK, and it's definitely more of the same. The first episode, (A scandal in Belgravia), is excellent, but the second, (The Hounds of Baskerville), is simply stunning! No spoilers here, but suffice to say the reworking of what is probably many people's favourite Holmes story is a piece of genius, and more of a thriller than the original. Now awaiting episode 3.
147676459X|5|if you like the hyperbole and a half blog you will like the book.  it is very cute and funny.  :)
B004NIUUNC|5|This book is for anyone seriously wanting to make a change in their life. A basic how to handbook on how to go about it successfully.  Rated a top five book by some of the leading Leadership gurus in America. Easy reading.
0823003035|5|This book is the most comprehensive one I've read to date, along with \\"Keys to Drawing\\". <br />It breaks down Ryder's over-the-top work into a simple drawing process which consists of an envelope (4-5 lines) that encapsulates the form, then a rough block-in to act as the basis for a detailed contour, and then scanning across the form as you start to draw out and push in the shapes themselves, utilising your knowledge of anatomy (which I suggest you get other books for, like Loomis, Villpu, Hogarth, Hale and Bridgeman). <br />You will find alot of valuable info about checking for tilt, relationship of shapes, non-parallelism (i.e. nothing in nature is parallel), behavior of light and shadow, pathways of form, gestural current, etc. <br />There's not much more to say other than, if you have the cash, you probably won't regret spending it on this great assembly of text, pictures and sound advice.
B004QZ9PLU|5|It was a beautiful story about family . It touched my heart and I loved reading it ! It's a perfect summer read !
030758836X|4|I enjoyed reading this book, and constantly wanted to know what would happen next.  Without ruining the ending, I will say that I was disappointed with how it ended, although at the same time, I was able to draw several examples from my own life that I could relate to the book.  Interesting and makes you think about the dynamics of relationships and compromises.
B003Q6D2BE|4|I just love seeing this cast together again; too much fun!  I really enjoyed the movie, a little light on plot, but very enjoyable.
B004LUHQ1G|2|Listen, I was super pumped for this album to come out... I heard Rope and White Limo before the record came out and listened to them over and over. I watched the little documentary on the \\"making of\\" this record on Palladia. When I found out my homeboy Butch Vig had a hand in this, it just fueled my excitement. So during the Palladia special, they made this huge deal about how the record was going to be recorded on tape. I'm sorry, but I'm not a mindless fanboy and I think that going backwards in technology is inferior. I felt like this was a gimmick to spread some kind of hype about the album. They also made a huge fuss about Bob Mould being featured on Dear Rosemary, a song that just doesn't sound good at all. Anyway, so I run out on my lunch break on release day and bought this CD and was quickly disappointed. The only 2 songs I liked were Rope and White Limo. Go figure. It has been over a year now and when I see all these 4 and 5 star ratings, I just have to wonder. Why.<br /><br />I think that 2 stars is an accurate rating for this CD. Songs like Dear Rosemary, Arlandria, and I Should Have Known just sound horrible and are not memorable. This is by no means one of FF's best. I recommend downloading Rope and White Limo for $2 on Amazon mp3 instead of spending your hard earned dollar on the whole thing.
B00A8ECU24|5|I love this game so much. It is such a cute game. I am not that far in it, but I cannot wait until I get Celestia and Rainbowdash, and others. I have 5 of the main six. Can't wait, so excited. Anyone who likes MLP I would recommend this game  yo. It really keeps you busy.
0064471837|5|This sounds like the basic set up for any fantasy world. It's not, though. The thing that fascinated me the most is that this world is fairly analogous to Earth in the 1940s. They have the sort of technology and culture that England had during that time, and that's not all. The world is divided into two halves, the New Kingdom and the Old Kingdom. Technology doesn't work in the old and magic doesn't work in the new. The wall, a dividing line between the two, is constantly guarded on both sides and not just anyone can cross. Sabriel, the daughter of a powerful necromancer, is an exception to that rule. She possesses her father's abilities and knowledge and, as the synopsis hints, has to use them to quiet the rising dead and their new ruler.<br /><br />In addition to what's, in my mind, a great bit of world building, Nix has created some very good characters. Sabriel is the sort of strong female character that I like to see in YA fiction. She doesn't need rescuing and in fact at one point rescues a royal male. She's not over the top though. She has her own fears and worries. She's far from indestructible and needs to adapt quickly to the changes in her life. She makes mistakes and earns her place in my heart. My other favortie character in this story is Mogget. He plays a reluctant and not entirely trustworthy adviser to Sabriel. There are truly some funny bits to their interactions.<br /><br />This is a well written novel. Not for nothing, it won an award or two. The world building is largely seamless. The threats to the characters are well handled. You feel pretty certain who's going to survive and who won't, but never so certain that there's no tension. There's plenty of action and suspense, with a dash of romance. I immediately handed this to my thirteen year old daughter to read. I give this five out of five wands.
0618680004|5|The best book that I have read  in a long time. Can't emphasize it enough, very good.
B000P0J09W|5|One of the greatest kids movies of the 1980s.  It's got adventure, romance, humor, and a little touch of scary.  It has a little bit of swearing in it, which I had not remembered until I showed it to my kids (but it seems like lots of kids movies from that era do have a little bad language now that I am rewatching them).  One of my favorite Spielberg kids ones.  Has a feel-good ending and kids working together to be heroes.  What could be better?
B000I9X668|5|I bought a copy for each member of my team, and a Red Stapler too, because I manage them at a very fast pace and they really step up. That was a year ago and they are sill using sentences from the movie. In tough times, this move cheers anybody up.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|Awesomeness. This gives a good challenge definitely gonna play full game
B00F8F3J2S|5|A Good Book Written by a Great American.<br />I enjoyed it very much a real eye opener.<br /><br />Thank You Robert Gates.
B00B6DTIGW|3|This movie could be better. I like the idea that the sprite videos follows them back to the house but there could have been more scary scenes before every dies. Either make it a two hr movie or less scenes at the new house they move into. Makes it more scary when the same things are happening in there old home because it never happened there. Its okay but not good either.

B006FK7SZ4|5|I live in a big city and it really helped me to find new friends locally. Just never believed that app could do so much :)
B00H83EV5W|5|This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time.  It was very much a thriller and certainly an emotional roller coaster.  Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are two of my favorites anyway, and they did very well together here.  Sandra was simply awesome in her mostly solitary role in this story.  Highly recommended!
B000002X4T|5|If you like Jefferson Airplane, and you don't own 'Volunteers,' you are missing out. It's one of the band's finest moments, and contains some classic songs.    First, after the release of this album, there would be some major changes. Drummer Spencer Dryden and Marty Balin would both depart from Jefferson Airplane.    But back to the album. Every song here is great, but the standouts are the title track, which has to be one of the best protest songs of the '60s, 'Wooden Ships,' a song written by David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Kantner on Crosby's boat, 'The Good Shepherd,' 'We Can Be Together,' and the psychedelic 'Eskimo Blue Day.'    The album cover is supposed to be like the front page of a newspaper. The cover photo I have always found to be very interesting. It shows the band just sitting down and relaxing.    Overall, if you don't own 'Volunteers,' you are really missing out. This is a classic Jefferson Airplane album, and a must own if you are a fan. I highly recommend this to any Jefferson Airplane fan. This is the band at their finest.    Highly recommended for any Jefferson Airplane fan. This album is a must own.    ENJOY!!!
B000RHKARO|5|John Mayall, pre-Stones Mick Taylor, and great song writing makes for a thumping good album! I'd place this in is the &#34;Turn it up loud and sing into my beer bottle!&#34; category. Give a listen to &#34;The Bear&#34; and you'll see the ability of a 18 year old Mick Taylor; too bad only this album was made by that line up.
B00CWIMVDW|5|Great series
B00G7QPST4|5|Loved this movie. The humor is great and the older generations can totally relate to the story. Thanks for making a movie that was as funny as it was inspirational to us seniors.
B0089LOG02|5|I love historical fiction !  This was a great book. Enjoyable & educational!

B00DDXJRJG|5|[[VIDEOID:b0f3b18dfa9c869c88bbaa3f7d1d7ef8]]UPDATE:  Used on a Non-Bluetooth tablet (Lollipop 5.0) in conjunction with a Bluetooth transmitter that dual pairs two sets of BT speakers... and BANG-ON!!  One of my best app purchases.  :)<br /><br />--- Original<br />Lot's of mixed reviews on this equalizer... but trust me, watch my video review and hear it for yourself.  It does work, and it works beautifully!<br /><br />I guess it all falls down to your output.  It's not going to do much good with in-built tablet speakers or even simple head-phones.  You need something that can really work with the various EQ adjustments.<br /><br />I have nothing too fancy, just a set of 3.5mm Insignia computer speakers with a subwoofer, but this EQ does the trick bang-on!  The amazing difference between the basic &#34;flat&#34; play from my tablet versus setting it to &#34;Classical&#34; or any other is dramatic.  This equalizer really has upped the sound quality that was already good from these old speakers.<br /><br />The permissions are clean - the Start Up at Boot is a completely optional convenience setting and is defaulted off.  The Record Audio is for EQ control for you actual Voice Recording software on your device (and does wonders for bad MICs), and the Global Audio merely lets you control your device audio through the app, which is also optional.  The code is completely clean.  Nothing.  Not even analytics.  So as an EQ without any hidden junk and a pretty low battery impact, I definitely recommend this - yet once again, it all depends on your audio output.  ;)
B0055PGUYU|5|Duhigg uses many interesting examples to explain the overwhelming power of habits. This book opened my eyes to the multitude of habits that control our day to day activities and the power we have to change them. This is a great read that is hard to put down.

B000V4NX04|5|This film does more than dramatize the effects of the surveillance state on those being watched; it also looks into its deleterious effects on the watchers. &#34;The Lives of Others&#34; is a moving and powerful drama that takes on even deeper meaning in the era of NSA overreach.
B00009V7P8|5|Damien's album O is one of my favorite albums now.  I have had it for a while (ordered as an import) and it has held up over repeated listenings.<br />He is also an incredible live performer (I have seen him 6 times).  His singing partner Lisa Hanigan is just as good.<br />I highly recommend this for fans of singer songwriters as well as fans of good low key music.  BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!

0375703764|1|I unfortunatly read this book a few years back based on a few friends praises, which I later realized were based mostly on the type setting. I for a long time thought this was another case of a meaningless novel being touted based on a few gimmicks, some of which I found quite interesting, but despite the fact that the narrator repeatedly says the book will change your life, you can never quite figure out why. The book seemed like an poorly concieved horror novel, with no real feeling, written by an author with a flare for game-playing. In short, i didn't really take it seriously. <br /> <br />I have recently found out that the book is actually far worse than what I originally thought. I learned this based on the fact I discovered the writings of Jorge Luis Borges and Umberto Eco. For those who haven't read these two authors, Jorge Luis Borges is rightfully considered one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century, and has been called the greatest writer in the Spanish language since Cervantes. He wrote many many things (though never a novel) about the abundance of human learning, the maze of meanings, eternity, infinity, identity, and life, his favorite metaphor was that of the Labrynth. One can see through 'House of Leaves' use of this metaphor that the writer was no stranger to Borges'  writings... or perhaps he was.... I've become mostly convinced of this since I began reading Umberto Eco's \\"The Name of the Rose,\\" Eco is a very intelligent scholar, also obsessed with the complexity of meaning, and an admirer of Borges. His book \\"The Name fo the Rose\\" was largly inspired by Borgesian themes, and is an intelligent investigation of those themes. The book was also ripped off front to back in House of Leaves. The books are both fictions of discovered texts that inspire a writer to investigate a story that alludes them (the language is almost the same in some places), the manuscripts all base on trying to investigate a mystery at the center of which is a labrynth that inspires people to murder. <br /> <br />The largest difference between \\"The Name of the Rose\\" and \\"House of Leaves\\" is the noticable lack of content in \\"House of Leaves.\\" Whereas in \\"The Name of the Rose,\\" people are always discussing some aspect of knowledge, and the overall plot forwards the basic thematic core of the book, \\"House of Leaves\\" fails to develop a thematic core that is any deeper than the typesetting. <br /> <br />Borges often put forward the basic rule that he followed in his writing, that he never let the form get in the way of the thought behind it. I don't believe that House of Leaves is inspired by Borges because it does the exact opposite. <br /> <br />Simply my suggestion is that if you haven't read Borges, you do so before House of Leaves. Borges is much easier reading, and you will get a lot more out of it. <br />And anyone who has read Borges should know that there are a million things that need to be read before this book
B002ZG977Y|4|I've never seen the original Clash of the Titans so I really had no expectations going into this remake. So while I can't vouch for it's faithfulness to the original story I can say this film is 100% fun from beginning to end.<br /><br />The plot follows loosely the story of Perseus and his rebellion of his godly heritage. It's not a very complicated plot, in fact there's not much to it than the whole lone outcast hero saves the world (or city in this case) against overwhelming odds. I don't think this is a bad thing at all. I realise after last year being spoiled with socially grounded spectecles like District 9 and Avatar (sort of) it's nice to see a high-end adventure film that doesn't have any hidden agenda. This isn't to say the film's mindless, it's actually got a very engaging tale to tell. You just won't be drawing any links to any modern political conflicts.<br /><br />Another great thing about this movie is it's acting. Sam Worthington is becoming my favorite action star (especially after his terrific work in Terminator 4 and Avatar). He's got more charisma and presence than any other action-hero actor out there and is a perfect choice to play Perseus. Ralph Fiennes also great as the alternating creepy and over-powering Hades. Gemma Arterton is well cast as the angel-faced Lo, who act's as Perseus guide and conscience.<br /><br />With the uncomplicated plot the special effects and actions scenes become Clash of the Titan's bread and butter..and man do they rock! I don't know why when dealing with big monsters in film they always make the criters look kinda cheesy. This is NOT the case with Clash of the Titans. The giant scorpians look deadly, Medusa is just as creepy as her backstory, and the Kraken gives you that \\"holy-crap\\" moment few films can pull off. The special effects are even put to good use when introducing the gods (Hades killing off Perseus' family is brief but particularly memorable).<br /><br />So while Clash of the Titans isn't going to win any big picture awards it is a hell of alot of fun. I never saw it in 3D nor do I want to. The special effects are just fine the way they are. There's nothing deep here, just good actors, good action, and a great sense of adventure.a hell of alot of fun. I never saw it in 3D nor do I want to.

B00CDT41RY|5|I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to watch a movie about anything \\"slavery\\" or with the \\"N word\\" I don't like it.  But, Django was one of the better movies I've seen in awhile. Jamie Foxx delivers in his performance. I can't see anyone else playing Django. If you are looking for a good movie to watch.  I suggest you watch Django. It'snot a movie I'd allow a child to watch or a teen. However, I'm of age and I don't care too much for violence.  This movie does have some violence. If Quinton made a movie it's got to have a certain level of violence.
B0000707YX|3|I like it

B00G6ZTM3Y|5|its awesome
B008BM9L72|4|I found  all three books good to read . must admit starting reding it to see what all the fuss was about and found i enjoyed the story line.. I know a lot of people looked for the mummy porn as they were explaining it but if you look past it there is a good story line  but you do need to read all 3 books to understand it
0440180295|3|As a novel, this book is a very nice piece of literature. For anyone interested in Vonnegut's writing, however, it appears very \\"done\\" - it seems Vonnegut intended this book for the mass audience, while some of his other books were meant more for a smaller audience, one that was ready for his bitter sarcasm and irony. In other words, this book is toned-down Vonnegut. While it has many interesting twists and turns, they are either to subtle for the average reader, or so obvious that they can no longer qualify as sarcasm, but are rather elementary criticisms of war, human nature, and society (the usual suspects). If you want something truly interesting, read his more thought-provoking novel, Sirans of Titan which is outstanding. If you are looking for sarcasm in general, make sure to check out One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, which is the best book ever written. Don't read Catcher in the Rye, it is irrelevant :)
B00000FBRE|5|This was the first lagwagon CD i bought a while back an it rules! There's no down sides to this cd every track is amazing, alot of people have said it is on a different wavelength to their other cd's and i agree but thats why it stands out. Its got more character than blaze which, dont get me wrong is an awsome cd and once your into it its amazing too, but i really think this cd stands out! :D Tony Hawk fans will remember may 16, anyone who loved that song will love this buy it now!!! Lagwagon fans without it, buy it trust me you need it!!! :D
B00BBI9WD6|5|I discovered this series by listening to Steve Gibson's Security Now podcast on the TwiT network. I had previously read the Gilbralter series based on his recommendation and was not disappointed so I tried Honor Harrington. If you enjoy epic space based science fiction and a STRONG female lead character, this book is for you.

B007PKSN6Q|5|This movie was so awesome, I ran out & immediately bought the soundtrack and I haven't taken it out of my CD player for a week!!! The only song I would scratch is the pop song \\"Undercover Love\\", which I understand is part of the movie, but I view this as truly a rock album and it doesn't belong. My favorite track is (without a doubt) \\"More Than Words/Heaven\\"!!! I absolute love this medley and Julianne Hough and Diego (forgot his last name, sorry) knock this one out of the park!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

0345440900|5|I read this book while I was pregnant, and again when my son was born, and had a difficult time napping and getting off to sleep at night.  It was a helpful guide, which is what ANY baby book should be, and it gave me some ideas on how to get my son to sleep on his own, without letting him cry (I do think the cry it out method is cruel)  What Tracy advocates, and I wholeheartedly agree, is to GET TO KNOW YOUR BABY above all else.  The EASY plan worked pretty well with my son, but I've adapted it a little; he doesn't always sleep in his crib for naps, as long as he is getting a healthy amount of sleep, we don't mind where he falls asleep.  Also, I don't watch the clock, I watch HIM, and just try to anticipate his needs before he gets frantic(this is my problem with demand feeding...I don't like the idea of waiting until he is so hungry that he cries...why not just watch his cues and feed him while he's happy???)  I don't understand people's complaint about the breastfeeding stuff.  I am breastfeeding, but not on demand...my son has been going every 2-3 hours since birth.  Sometimes, he gets hungry sooner, sometimes later, but I have the sense enough to just feed him, not just follow the 'orders' of a book.  Come on, people...no book is going to give you a cure all to your baby's crying, sleeping and eating, you do have to use a little commom sense, and get to know this little person.  At 5 weeks old, my baby is not sleeping through the night...and I don't need him to be just yet; he's well rested, happy, and gaining weight like a champ...all because I used Tracy's book, and my own instinct!!!
B00IRMQADY|4|Excellent show!  I thought the acting was excellent, and it certainly depicted how the black Americans were treated during that period.
B00024I2Z4|3|I like the quality of this movie ; however, the case was promised to me to be in good condition with minor wear which was not the case. Most of the side of the case was broken off and the cover doesn't even close. The picture of Mulan on the cover is faded dark and there are a few scratches on it.
B007IXWKUK|2|By the time I got through the first few chapters, I was done<br />Its more of the same<br />-Elementary writing<br />-Same story line, different scenarios<br />-Women's erotica intended to be read in small quick bursts as opposed to in the same manner as one would read a novel
0446310786|5|In the book, To Kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee shows the values in life that we should all go by. Scout, a young girl, her brother Jem, and Atticus Finch are a family that lives in the early 1900's in a small town called Maycomb. It's a racist town that discriminates against black people. Their father takes on a trial of defending a black man, Tom Robinson, who has been tried with rape. He feels that is morally right, and that it would be a sin to not do it, just like killing a mockingbird, one of the most harmless animals on earth. My reaction to the Novel was that I feel like we all live life in the way that we shouldn't. We should use the sang \\"It's a Sin to kill a mockingbird\\". To me, it's a way of expressing how we should treat each other. We should all help each other out, even in the worst possible situations. We should help someone, even if the people around us will hate us for it. It would be something that would be right to do and it would be a nice thing for our life. It also makes me take life a little bit slower. We shouldn't rush through things just to get it done, and we shouldn't rush through it so we don't have to experience the pain/sorrow. We should all help each other. I recommend this because we could all learn something from it. How it can help us later and now in life. How we can help people in need. It's a very good book that anyone would enjoy. It will take you to a place that you would least expect to read about in the active life we live today. It would teach us true meanings about life. Anyone can read it, and they will probably like it. I didn't want to read it at first, and it thought it would be boring. But I got into it quickly and it taught me something and I never expected to.
B0020BUWX2|4|Not so fond of the ending. But the story line keeps you interested, hopefully the movie will explain the missing parts.
B00BAXFECK|3|I found this book too wordy.  The sequence of events seemed to drag on and I put the book down several times but in the final analysis decided to get through it.  Not my favorite read.

B000002U8G|5|Back in the days of vinyl I loved echoes but hadn't really connected with side one. Too acoustic. Too silly. And except for track one, too mellow. Now decades later I'm rediscovering Meddle. It's a lot better than I remember. Tuneful and melodious. Varied and interesting. Highly recommended here not for its role in the Pink Floyd cannon, but rather for the lasting quality of its songs.

1848373104|5|MY DEAR READER<br /><br />I cannot but be rendered in the highest of spirits upon completing this volume yet again, as I have always preferred extensive reading to trivial pleasures.<br /><br />Dwelling on particular passages and turns of phrase, I am reminded of how ardently I admire and love the prose that issued forth when Miss Austen put ink to paper many a fortnight ago.<br /><br />Neither common, nor dull, nor threadbare, each chapter engrosses completely with accounts of gentlemen of handsome countenance and ladies both sensible and silly.<br /><br />And though its conclusion is known most intimately to my own heart, anxiously I turn each page to venture ever farther away from the misconstrued encounters and lamentable conduct of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy.<br /><br />When finally all is concluded and the mistress of Pemberley assured, only then can I chuse another distraction to engage my solitary hours. I wish nothing less than for you to know the same adoration yourself.<br /><br />Yours, &c.
B00DR0PDNE|1|Piece of garbage.  It can't find the &#34;cast&#34; extension which I downloaded for the chrome browser, and just gives error messages such as &#34;unable to cast to device&#34;.

Unfortunately, by the time I tried using it, it was out of its very short warranty period. Very unhappy with google.
0060090383|3|Seven years after introducing the Walsh sisters in Watermelon, Marian Keyes in 2002 returned to the family with Rachel's Holiday, a much stronger novel but one that still shows significant flaws. Rachel is the middle sister, a 20-something living in New York with her best friend, obsessing about finding the right boyfriend with the right look, and succumbing to lure of alcohol, cocaine and prescription medication. After she turns up with a freshly-pumped stomach in an emergency room, her family whisks her back to Ireland for rehab. Although Rachel resists her diagnosis of addict, she agrees to sign in to the rehab of choice for Irish rock stars, figuring it will be glam and spa-like experience but finds out the hard way that treatment is no holiday. In this outing, Keyes has settled into her Walsh structure -- intercutting a now story focusing on the current crisis with a then story depicting the events leading up to the incident that kicks off the plot. Unfortunately, Rachel's then story of her descent into addiction is banal and uninteresting, and I found myself skipping those chapters. Pre-stomach pumping, Rachel is shallow young woman obsessed with trivialities and watching her crash and burn again and again is boring. Far more interesting is Keyes' depiction of the treatment regimen she undergoes and her fellow addicts and the myriad problems which led to their addiction. Keyes leavens the darker now story with her trademark humor but never pretends that Rachel's predicament isn't very serious. This turn to a more serious theme is what saved Keyes' career when chick-lit itself crashed and burned.
B003Q6D27S|3|3-D has taken the theaters by storm this past year. So much so that everything but the kitchen sink has been tossed at audiences (and I'm not certain that even that hasn't been thrown). Greek Gods to zombies have found there way to the format so is it any wonder that a horror series jumped on board? SAW 3D THE FINAL CHAPTER supplies that need.<br /><br />Fans of the film series have loved every gruesome, gory scene offered. But now they had the chance to witness it in 3D in theaters. But with the movie being released on DVD in regular 2D format is it a good movie? Without the comin' at ya type effects, is it any good? The answer is yes and no.<br /><br />If you've been following the series at all you know that the film began with 2 people chained in a run down old subway type bathroom being provided knowledge of how they had wronged people and given a chance to make a choice, one that would involve some great pain or damage, but that would give them the chance to make write their wrongs.<br /><br />The series continued in this vein with the main character of Jigsaw, the culprit who was behind the dangerous torture fueled traps that held each person captive, who in reality was John Kramer (Tobin Bell). It seems that John was diagnosed with an inoperable condition and then treated poorly by everyone from insurance agents to police. With nothing to lose, he set out to help people change their lives, giving them an opportunity to become valued members of society or perish in the process. Talk about tough love.<br /><br />By the time this film opens, John's last assistant has gone on a rampage and disgraced the original intent that John began with. Sure it was crazy, but Det. Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) has taken it into a whole different direction. As seen in the last film, rather than truly offering people a chance to change, he's set out on making the traps inescapable. Instead of a chance it is now out and out murder.<br /><br />It appeared that he was facing death at the hands of John's wife (Betsy Russell) in the last film, but he escaped and is now searching for her as well as setting up a whole new game for Bobby Dagen (Sean Patrick Flannery). It seems that Dagen claimed to be on of Jigsaw's victims, profiting from writing a book about his experience and going on to creating self help groups for other victims as well as a DVD of their meetings.<br /><br />Now Bobby must face Jigsaw for real in the form of Hoffman.

140006922X|5|The religious scholar Reza Aslan seems to have managed to bring down quite a bit of controversy on his head for daring to be a Muslim and yet write a book about Jesus, but for whatever this opinion is worth, there actually aren't very many new ideas in this volume. Albert Schweitzer offered a similar opinion about the historical Jesus a century ago, and backed it up with much the same evidence that Aslan uses here. To me the chief strength of this book is in its method of presentation: well written, well argued, and a compelling read.
B000002GEY|5|It's difficult to say exactly what the best Supertramp album is because they had so many greats but this one is perhaps not only their best  but also one of rocks greatest!  I can't think of another ablum that received so much airplay on so many different radio stations than this one. A Hall of Famer!!
B00DZ83IPS|4|A little slow moving at times but a good movie.

1616550414|4|Well translated and colorful, the book is solidly constructed.  It covers mostly design details, but there are a few fluffier segments sure to delight any Zelda fan.  Wouldn't call it an absolute must, but it's a nice, welcome flourish.
B00JZKSN3M|4|I can connect with friends and play matches when I try to connect to quick match - it just stays at the loading screen.<br />AWESOME APP other then that. You can create urban own races (:
B00L9B7IKE|1|There is not one single character to like in this novel.  They are deceitful but filled with self pity.  Reminded me of Gone Girl which I did not like either.
B004EPYZZI|5|I had already seen the movie and wanted to add it to my library that I lend to people. It is one I will watch again and again for sure and loan out as the opportunity allows.

B0027MJU00|5|This is the best of the 3 books that I have read by Gillian Flynn. It was difficult to leave the book when I had to put it down for other obligations! however it is not for the faint of heart as with her other books, the main character is broken.
B005ERIRZE|5|very pleased with this product that is nearly new and was shipped promptly and was was well packed so thanks
B00MUCX6AW|5|great movie! Loved the concept, kind of like &#34;Groundhog Day&#34; but with more violence (it's a war).

B000056K04|1|I love Dylan, Hendrix, the Stones, the Beatles, both Elvises, Graham Parker, Van Morrison, and a boatload of other great artists too numerous to mention.  I have this hatred for Dave Matthews voice that I am surprised to see is not shared by more people.  One would think that anyone who can love the nasal twangs from such varied artists as Dylan and Jon Andersen (not of Yes, but the country singer) should be able to appreciate the screeching, throaty sudden note changes of Dave Matthews, but that is not the case.  Matthews sounds so much like a jackass that I flip the station every time he starts braying, er, singing.  If you like the oversinging of Joe Jackson, or the &quot;whispering as loud as I can voice&quot; of Olivia Newton John, you might like this guy.  Personally, I think a lot of people are being fooled by the Billy Joel or Barry Manilow of the Pepsi Generation.  Please, make mine a Coke and hold the braying to a minimum.

1427208980|5|The premise of this book is that while technology and knowledge march forward at an astonishing pace, the human brain is not able manage the vast amount of information that has come with it.  No matter how expert or specialized we each may become, in many occupations, a single lapse of memory can lead to catastrophe.  Gawande's simple solution is to handle that complexity with checklists.  Specifically, his checklists are defined to be short reminders of steps to be performed without detailing every minute detail.  It's elegant and useful - and unfortunately, something I've seen violated numerous times throughout documentation I've read.  Put simply, the people using checklists are assumed to already be experts in their field.  A pilot taxiing to a runway has already been through significant training and could almost certainly get the plane in the air without a checklist.  But the presence of the checklist makes sure that EVERY pilot on EVERY flight can get the plan in the air safely, regardless of distractions, weather, etc.  Checklists lead to repeatable success in the hands of the expert.  They are not an instruction manual.  This book was pretty influential for me.  I feel like I've made good use of it in my work and have found it successful.  Creating a checklist sounds like child's play, yet Gawande shows that it's a bit of an art form.  If nothing else, after reading this book, you'll have a new-found appreciation for the complexity of the medical profession.
B006HTUZ1C|2|i used to love this game. I used the side tap instead of the swipe because it's faster. sadly, that option is unavailable in the current update. new graphics look snazzy, though.
B00PTB7B34|5|Two words; Freakin' Sweet. Just awesome. Good job. Keep updating.
B003F3PMYI|4|This book is full of great stories and practical advice that many people are already aware of but may need a reminder.
0446577383|1|If you view the U.S.and the War on Terror through Michael Moore style coke-bottle glasses, you might like this book.  I don't and didn't.  Even sophomoric politics aside, the book lacked the novelization and plot skills of a Lescroart, Connolloy, W.E.B. Griffin, Grisham (most of the time) etc.I gave up reading it halfway through.  Just seemed a little too contrived and I was put off my his anti-American bent. In this, it seems little different than other of Baldacci's book which I seem to toss before getting to the middle of the book.  And that's where this book's heading. <br /> <br /> <br />
0345803507|5|Well, I got sucked into reading all 3 of the Fifty Shades Books.  They are hard to put down and a good read however, a lot of it is so repetitive and I got satiated very quickly with all the graphic sexual scenes that I started skipping them !  But I got all 3 so what does that tell you?
B0086700CM|5|this game is great the thing I bate about most games is they make you buy something but not this one!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :):):(:):)
B00006BTCA|4|We'll start off with the blatantly obvious--this band's ripping off Joy Division to no end--but besides that, they've also created some seriously stirring music that lacks a peer in today's video-driven music industry.<br />At times you'll hear Slowdive, The Smiths, The Jesus And Mary Chain, New Order, Depeche Mode, etc.  I think the point's been made that this isn't an original band, but at least the conviction is there.  Besides which, they've got great taste in rip-offs.<br />They may be silly and ignorant, but they've got guts, and guts is enough.
0345440900|1|Parenting is such a personal thing and everyone has their own style.  For me, honestly, I feel this book lays a poor foundation between the parent and the child.  Sure she has some ways of getting your child to behave the way you want them to; but that was exactly my problem with the book.  I was uncomfortable with many of the tenents espoused here.  Of course there was a lot of sound advice, but overall the main principles of this guide conflict with what I see as positive, thoughtful, child oriented parenting.  My criteria for anything I read:  I ask myself if I was the child would I want my parents reading this book.  My answer on this one is a NO.
B00CH26TL8|2|tired of it
B00DZ83IPS|5|Great movie!
B00007E7K0|5|Extremely satisfied with the finish and lens cap for my Canon T2i. After losing the original cap, I kept looking around for a cap with the Canon finish at a very good price. I found the item through deepdiscounts. Shipping was EXTREMELY fast. A++ seller will def do business with again.
0771035799|4|Ben Goldacre's Bad Science was a pleasure to read. He very thoroughly covered clinical trial design and statistics in a way that was not mind-numbingly dull. With this background he explored some of the less scientific areas of health care such as homeopathy. If you are expecting a neutral discussion of topics such as these, then you will be disappointed as Goldacre sticks to the facts, which do support mainstream medicine. If you are on the side of real medicine however, I strongly recommend this book to you. The only shortcomings are that a lot of references are to situations in the U.K. and that Goldacre only talks about medicine, contrary to the name of the book. If you are more interested in general science, then I recommend Demon-Haunted World by Carl Sagan.
B00003CXRM|3|Sorry, even though I love the Coen brothers I just can't give this movie more than 3.5 stars.  I'm not exactly sure what it is that didn't grab me. I was absolutely stunned, as always, by the tremendous visuals that the Coens threw up there on the big screen, but the lack of a clear, coherent purpose in this movie set me off a little bit.  First of all let's get one thing straight, this movie is not based on the odyssey.  Apart from the siren scene, the fact that Clooney's character is named Ulyssees and that his wife is named Penelope there are no similarities.  The movie does have it's highlights (a muffed KKK ralley for example where the Coens make the sheet toting idiots out to be the total morons that they are) but I think the predominance of bluegrass music really threw me off.  As with every Coen movie, every component--dialogue, cinematography, music--all are utilized to their fullest potential and injected with the maximum amount of meaning.  The bluegrass music is therefore a key component and you can't just tune it out if you hate bluegrass music like I do.  So essentially if you love bluegrass music you might think this is the best movie ever made, if not, you'll still find something to enjoy, but it will be somewhat tainted.
B00018D44U|5|I have always been a big Norah Jones fan! I love all of her music and this was no exception!
B00HQI7VMY|5|This is my favorite music DVD.  I have seen it on VHS many times & now I have it on Blu-ray!  Highly recommend this for any music lover.
B0024F08RO|5|Very fast shipping and very accurate product description.
B00J2PRBNS|1|Previews hype it up.  Doesn't really hold your attention throughout the film.  Good actors, but a poorly produced film.  Eh...
0553573403|5|I took this book on vacation with me in case I had a few minutes to read here and there. I ended up reading it in two and a half days! I could not put it down. This is what epic fantsy is all about. I could go on and on about how great this is, but there are so many good reviews here another rant about the brilliance of this first book of the series is unnecessary. So I leave you with these few humble statements. This book is amazing. It is the high mark of epic fantasy. It really is the total package. If you have not yet immersed yourself in the world of George R. R. Martin, do so, and you will wonder why you have waited.
B004O3YGMC|5|This app I'd great for accessing your computer from your phone and tablet. Easy setup and way to use. Listen to your music, watch your videos and access  your pictures remotely.
B002ZG99TA|5|An outstanding movie and was a delight to watch. Denzel W. did a great job in his performance like always.
B00DJZR46G|4|Like it a lot!  Lots of piano!  Great background singers...
B00N6PCXME|4|No matter how great the peacemakers are, no matter how powerful the warriors are, war never ends. Although The Buried Giant is set right after the time of King Arthur, I think the story is a metaphor for our own time. People keep hating each other and fighting each other for generations. Every body in the book is on a quest. Will they ever find what they're looking for when they are surrounded by dishonesty, hatred, and war? Will ill will ever end?
B0070ZLZ1G|5|This is required reading for anyone interested in solving the education crisis.  It's well researched, data based, and has a compelling narrative. Another book I'd recommend is &#34;The Smartest Kids in the World&#34;, which looks at how other countries educate their kids.
B0089LOG02|5|This is an excellent book.  I really enjoyed reading it and learned about history from a specific period in the USA.  The author´s style is smooth and very clear.  The violence is more psychological than physical and the sexual content is minimal.  I recommend the book 100%.
B0095R6OUO|5|Classic
B00H5D533O|3|You can tell Benmont picked up more then a few pointers in his years playing with Tom Petty and numerous other acts. His original songs are beautiful and his choice of Bob Dylan covers spot on. In fact, they shine.<br /><br />I can only say I would have loved to have heard his originals possibly sung by Tom. He should be allowed to do some of these on the next TP and the HB's tour.
B00BAXFECK|3|I found this book to be self-indulgent at times. Some moments of elegant writing.  Relationship of young man and painting beautifully drawn.
0812550706|3|<br /> Ender's Game, written by Orison Scott Card is very interesting book.  It is captivating to read.  The way Orison Scott Card wrote it was more startling than other books.  If you go from reading a primary source to reading a fiction story, it is somewhat weird to understand.  Before you read this book, read another fiction story.  Then that way you can have your imagination at a higher level.  You then can understand it, better.  If you go from reading a true story you are imagining things at a level were it is things the actually happen.  When you imagination is at higher level, you can imagine the things that are happening in the story.  You then understand the book a lot better <br /> <br /> There is a plot to the story.  It is not a book that you read for no purpose.  There is action throughout the book because it deals battles in space.  Throughout the book, the are battles between the teams.  The teams go against each other.  The battles are just simulation battles.  <br /> <br /> There are a couple of intriguing parts in the book.  You just have to understand it better.  The book is somewhat long, but not too long. <br /> <br /> I think that anyone who likes to read or just likes sci-fi books will like this novel.  If not, do not read it because it will bore you to death. <br /> <br />
B00NJT3A5Q|5|Great music!
B000OVLBEO|2|Bottom Line:  Other than Eva Mendes' cleavage, this movie was pretty dumb.  The dialog was campy and the plot was see through.  Seemed like a set up for a sequel; Note to Studio: Don't bother.  If the director was going for a cheesy kind of comic book thing, he hit it right on.  The problem is that this is a big screen movie - go read the comic book if you are looking for cheese.
B000002UB3|4|Being only 18, I am only just 'discovering' the Beatles. It was only recently, when I became more interested in music that I began to appreciate older music (mainly from the late 60s until present). I heard the No. 1 album, and found the earlier songs catchy and very-pop friendly but strangely lacking in substance. Older songs such as 'Hey Jude' and 'Let It Be' are, however, real classics. <br /> <br />The other day I bought 'Abbey Road' the second-highest selling beatles album and am not dissapointed. I won't say anything that hasn't already been said, but the short track 'Sun King' is a real sleeper and one of the gems on this album. It has a mystical quality to it. Maxwell's Silver Hammer and 'Her Majesty' were quirky little, very British numbers while the only song I disliked was 'Octopus' Garden' save the clever guitar intro. Other than that, I find 'Something' a bit overrated but still good (the same can be said for 'Come Together') but 'Because' was a very good track. In order, I would say my favourite tracks are, Sun King, Because, Come Together and Mean Mr. Mustard. <br /> <br />
B002ZG976U|5|Great movie!  Love Christina Aguilera and the message of perseverance in this movie.
B000M5EHES|5|VIDEO WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION, STILL IN THE CELLO WRAP. I HAVE WATCHED IT TWICE AND LOVE IT AS MUCH NOW AS I DID WHEN FIRST WATCHING IT.  THANK YOU TO COMPANIES WHO WILL DO THIS FOR US WHO LIKE THE OLD MOVIES.
B00O5LQCFM|5|Anton does a great job as usual DM in top form
B009LK6JS2|4|Nice, but you have to both calibrate &amp; work through the tutorials to enjoy.  DON'T try to just jump in &amp; play.
B007O3BGZE|4|I was not blown away by my first few listens to this.  This is a grower and takes time to digest.  My only experience with It Bites is due to John Mitchell and his stellar guitar playing.  Well Mr. Mitchell is not the only stellar musician here, everyone shines.  This release has more of a subdued feel than the catchy pop-prog style of \\"The Tall Ships\\", and maybe that's why it took me longer to catch on.  Any band can get in a rut and repeat themselves, but those that alter their writing style and still sound good show versatility and class.<br /><br />I really like the raspy lead vocals and the layering of the backing vocals stand out on all tracks.  My current faves include the title track, and \\"The Big Machine\\" - although the chorus seems similar to \\"The Tall Ships\\".  \\"Send No Flowers\\" took me a long time to appreciate but it is tasty.  \\"Meadow and the Stream\\" may be the most progressive song on this disc, but the short lyrics of the chorus is kind of awkward.  And the ballad \\"The Last Escape\\" is awesome.  Everything about this disc shows attention to detail... the music, the production, the booklet, and the disc itself looks like a record.  Well done chaps!
B001VFEKOK|5|I am a huge Twilight fan and it really upsets me that the songs included on this CD differ according to the vendor you purchase them from. You get more songs from Amazon than you do from ITunes, but ITunes includes the other Rob Pattinson song \\"Let me Sign\\". I love the extras that came with the Amazon download, but it bites that if you want \\"Let me Sign\\" you have to pay for the album all over again. I have seen this on other movie CD's too. I think both the movie and the music is mesmerizing and can's get enough of either. Can't wait for New Moon.
B00BJ9VBLI|5|Love the game, very time consuming, improving my eye hand coordination!!
B006LSZECO|1|I liked the very beginning but I hate the way it's written.  I finished it because I had paid $11 for the Kindle edition, I tried and I tried but it was an agony.  Confusing,not well well written (I am sorry),  it really left me empty.  I have a friend that tried to read it and gave up.
B00001PE4D|1|I can't believe I watched the whole movie. I cannot recommend this movie for any reason. Sorry. It is that bad. I cannot believe Reese Witherspoon accepted this script.
B00000G3PA|5|love this movie
B00J2VSS0C|4|Start off easy but become challenging. Pulls you in the story line and makes you wonder what happened in this small town.
B00CNQ7HAU|4|Another fun Grisham read.  I enjoyed the winding path the story leads us on, although I guessed the significance of the sycamore tree and the tie in to the maid in the first 40 pages.  I know that the author ended the book with an echo of the ending of A Time to Kill, but I question the location of the last setting since the traumatized brother would not have willingly gone to that location for a &#34;friendly outing&#34;.  Bad on you, Mr. Grisham!
3551551677|5|It's a classic children's book and the series is loved by so many.  This is a great way for a parent, or in my case, grandparent to teach a child a new language or at least introduce them to it!  I adore the Harry Potter books and the fact they can teach our children as well as broaden their minds is such a bonus.  In my mind, and heart, I will NEVER outgrow this book series.
B001JIFYSA|5|Great movie for XMAS.
B008D37SGU|5|I love watching movies that end different. Throughout the whole movie I could not predict what would happen next. It keep my attention the whole time. Just love it!
B000MRAAJW|5|This is an amazing series to share with the whole family.  We have thoroughly enjoyed it.
B004DLPXAO|3|Nothing works as well on my Android tablet as on my non-Android tablets or PCs.  There's always less features and really, I wish they'd get it equal across the board with the non-Android version.
B0089LOKHG|4|This was a good book, But I will say it did leave me still wanting more from the story, As a final book it was a cliff hanger. I find myself still needing to know where everyone ends up. But it was still a good book Just left me unsatisfied.
B00AREIAI8|5|Good app and I would recommend this game for anyone. I like the game for its horse's color. Lolgamer4life1 is the best
B0000636UN|5|Not much to say here, except that this is my favorite Sheryl Crow album to date.  I love the music, the lyrics and her very soulful &amp; emotive singing.  Definitely worth the purchase price.
B0094BB4TW|1|Piece of carp doesn't even download for my kindle .....please fix this.
B000FFJYCU|4|Acting, racing actions and European scenery are excellent and stand the test of time.  Lots of good shots of sixties-era F1 cars for car and racing buffs...
0760748683|5|This is a nice copy of the book.  It has a built in ribbon bookmark and nice line drawing illustrations.  It is about 3 inches wide and 5 inches long (smaller than a standard book).  It is a very pretty version of the book though, and would be great as a gift.  Seems like it is well made.  It does have thin pages, but it doesn't seem problematic.
B00GFD6X2A|4|Very funny story with the most unlikely plot. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B0094BB4TW|3|Good for connecting with friends and family but sad that people use it for hanging dirty laundry, personal arguments, or a diary! Really? Those people should automatically be knocked off instead of ruining it for others! Guess you could work on developing a program for those kind of people. I bet it would be Very popular and would leave  Facebook for us to enjoy! :)
B006GWO5NE|5|This is a well made cable that is thick enough to provide power to all of your devices not just a Kindle. I use it for my phone and tablet more than my Kindle. Problem I have been finding with other cheaper cords is they are to thin to provide the power needed for my Samsung galaxy S4 to charge correctly. But since finding this cord I don't have that problem anymore.
B00IQE4NUK|2|Well it's finally happened. Coldplay has attained Lite FM status. The ony thing that could make this album more ho-hum is listening to it while on Xanax. The melodies are unmotivated. The lyrics are predictably sappy and uninspired. It's a mish mash of pablum, a hodge podge of incessant whining. The end results make me want to take a long nap. If you're going to try and do music that's introspective, it should make you feel refreshed and renewed at the end, not drained and ready to lapse into a coma. Cheer up, Chris Martin. It's not that bad. But this CD Is.
B00CHIY5OK|5|Very sound solid cd,, straight thru hits every songs just makes you want to dance makes me feel good when I listen to it.
B00BR4QNJ0|5|Love this game I play it all the time when I'm bored. I reccomend this to anyone who likes a challenge in a game.
B00DFFHUUA|1|One of the worst movies I've ever forced myself to sit through.  Should have stopped during the opening credits. Don't watch this.
B00005JLPK|5|I recently watched this for the second time after initially watching it some years ago and was even more impressed the second time around. While the reasons might not interest anyone but me, the fact is, this movie touched me and moved me deeply. For starters, it is a gorgeous film to watch. The seamless integration of live actors into Kahlo's stunning and evocative work is a magical joy to behold and adds even more depth to the artist's brutally candid art. Secondly, Salma Hayek and Alfred Molina deliver top notch performances and most impressive may have been Hayek who is on screen nearly the entire time. I can forgive the vanity hiring of Ashley Judd and Edward Norton as their portrayals are less than the aforementioned two, but this is a minor issue. Lastly, regarding the dvd features and what-not, the second disc is mostly behind the scenes featurettes on the making of the movie whereas the special features on the first disc have lengthy interviews that are illuminating and candid while demonstrating the love Hayek and Taymor have for Kahlo.<br />I am not a Frida Kahlo scholar by any means nor do I wish to convey any knowledge of her art, life, politics, or anything else. I know that I find her paintings to be vivid and mesmerizing and that's enough for me. I am grateful to this movie for giving me an introduction to an artist whose work I have grown fascinated with and I am furthermore glad that I have a little knowledge, albeit Hollywoodized, of this remarkable human being. My interest has been piqued by this sumptuous love letter to Frida and I will continue to enjoy this movie and my exploration of her work and her life. I hope you find a similar experience.
B00BSBR9N6|5|Who would have thought that a story about a genetics professor with Asperger's Syndrome would be so entertaining? The author makes it that way with the dry humor and often deadpan observations of the world through the main character's eyes. He is a sympathetic character who you find yourself rooting for and there are several funny situations along with sub-plots that keep the story interesting.

So, do your homework.<br />My favorite message, from this book, which I have used as a quote in published articles is, &quot;If you alienate your peeers, you won't have to worry about corporate enemies.&quot;<br />Read this book to balance being yourself, and being a person amongst business people.

B0014DCTCY|5|This is a half-speed mastered version of the Black Keys first real &#34;produced&#34; record. If you don't know, half-speed mastering is a process that results in really killer sound. Essentially, it sounds more &#34;punched&#34;....more bass, more subtleties , more dynamic range...in a word Awesome! There is no better way to hear the Keys than this. ( Except of course Live) Furthermore, at this price it is an absolute bargain. Most half-speed mastered records cost twice the price. Buy it!
B00F87ZUYG|5|THE BEST SHOW ON TV EVER!!!
B003UESJH4|3|This movie was well-made and well-acted. Indeed it had everything except . . . a story.  I kept getting the feeling that whoever thought to make this movie was trying to make something out of nothing---i.e., take a few historical facts and create a story around it. The friendship between Logue and the King was not developed to the point that I really cared about it, so some moments that I gather should have been climactic (e.g., when the King insults Logue and walks off), really didn't matter so much. Also, I suppose I was waiting for the PYGLMALION moment, and I just didn't see that in the King's final radio address.  It was realistic in that way, I suppose, but it didn't make for those high moments that one comes to expect in a performance.

B00004RF98|5|Signing in the Rain has to be the best musical ever. Debbie Reynolds is perfect in her role, and her voice is amazing. Gene Kelly is completely amazing, one of the most talented movie actors ever. And Donald O'Conner is just amazing. But Jean Hagen as Lina Lamont was my absolute favorite.<br /><br />This movie gave us great classic songs like \\"Good Morning\\" and \\"Singing in the Rain\\". This is a great fun musical. I completely enjoyed it.
B007I2BZIE|5|This CD requires several listening sessions before formulating an entire opinion. Initially, I was a little mixed about it but after listening multiple times, I have come to view it as one of Rush's best studio works in quite a while. Certainly, new fans will appreciate the musical talent of Rush as a 3-member act with this work but true, longtime, impartial Rush fans will also recognize that Lee/Lifeson/Peart are still at the \\"top of their game\\".<br /><br />I had read a few reviews mentioning how Geddy Lee can no longer sing in the same range as he used to and also how the mixed result of this CD sounded as if it was pieced together. While it is probably true that Geddy's voice is not the same as 30 years ago, the same can be said for Bono, Jon Anderson, Robert Plant and anyone else who had an exceptional range. Still-in-all, Geddy's voice is strong in this work and the musical synergy of the trio more than makes up for any \\"perceived\\" loss of range. One is too busy listening and enjoying than worrying about what keys that Rush is playing in to accommodate Geddy's vocal range.<br /><br />I listened on both home/car stereos and could not tell where the music was heard as being \\"pieced\\" together. Frankly, I was too busy focusing on the music, which is a 12-song effort. Also, perhaps I am just not that adept at being able to tell the difference at whether or not Geddy and Alex were in the studio at the same time that Neil was recording his tracks. In essence, who cares? The music is definitely seamless.<br /><br />My initial reaction about the musicianship was that it was stellar -- among the best that Rush has ever done. Neil Peart introduces some new drum rhythms, Geddy's bass playing is phenomenal and Alex Lifeson incorporates new ideas, new textures and new sounds that he hasn't really used before. One gets a sense of the cohesion and chemistry that Rush has enjoyed over the last 40 years of making music together. It is a rarity and one that has put them on a well-deserved high pedestal in the world of progressive rock. Surprisingly, many songs on this CD have a harder \\"drive\\" and, in general, are more hard-rocking compared to some of Rush's past work... Not bad for the three, who each have to be close to 60 years old.<br /><br />I won't go into what each song means. Just know that it's Professor Peart, hard at work, waxing poetic about the purported theme of the album:<br /><br />\\"In a young man's quest to follow his dreams, he is caught between the grandiose forces of order and chaos. He travels across a lavish and colorful world of steampunk and alchemy, with lost cities, pirates, anarchists, exotic carnivals, and a rigid Watchmaker who imposes precision on every aspect of daily life.\\"<br /><br />Each song on this CD is catchy in its own respect but some favorites here are \\"The Anarchist\\", \\"Carnies\\", \\"Seven Cities of Gold\\", \\"The Wreckers\\", \\"Headlong Flight\\" and \\"The Garden\\". \\"The Garden\\" has a softer, ballad-like approach and demonstrates the vastness of creativity in Rush. In fact, \\"The Garden\\" is a significant achievement for them in their own right -- it juxtaposes the rest of the hard-rocking album with a final, softer, more humanistic song, replete with string ensemble, about the fragility of life and how easily personal achievements are lost, from one moment of being to the next. When I hear this song and compare it to the entire history of Rush, it marks a particular high maturity and importance...<br /><br />The more I listen to this CD, the more hooked I am. Although I saw merit in \\"Vapor Trails\\" and \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" (as I do in all of Rush's music), \\"Clockwork Angels\\" has so much more going on musically. There are so many new ideas incorporated that I find myself constantly vascillating between the heavy, rapid pounding beat of \\"Headlong Flight\\" and the ballad-like, well-orchestrated \\"The Garden\\" in my daily activities... \\"Headlong Flight\\" has the tempo of \\"Bastille Day\\" (Fly by Night) and \\"Analog Kid\\" (Signals), and (to me) is borderline metal. The same applies to much of Alex's playing on CA and it is really refreshing to see how Rush has evolved as a band. By the same token, they have put a lot of musical effort into this work and should be given proper due. They could have packed it in and retired many times in the past 10-15 years but they have taken the risks and surpassed them by far.<br /><br />Those who are still living in Rush's past days (e.g. Tom Sawyer, Subdivisions), as some reviewers seem to be, will not appreciate this work as much as those who can objectively listen. The musical architecture of \\"Clockwork Angels\\" reflects three legendary musicians with extraordinary musical vision, who \\"march to the beat\\" of their own music...<br /><br />On a final note, the use of keyboards is also reintroduced on this work in a tasteful, but not overbearing manner. Overall, Rush has put together a very formidable, respectable effort on \\"Clockwork Angels\\".ls), and (to me) is borderline metal.

B005K0HDGE|4|What can I say that hasn't already been said about this book? \\"11/22/63\\" was everything that I wanted it to be. Great characterization, a solid plot, a significant number of twists and turns, and a satisfying ending were all part of this voluminous work. It's a better book than King's most recent humongous tome', \\"Under the Dome\\" if, for no other reason, because it's written with more passion (but I did like \\"UtD\\"). King's done his homework and really makes the reader feel part of the world of the late '50s and early '60s. Baby Boomers, especially, will relate to the many references to '50s TV shows, commercials, products, and the like.  The bottom line...King's legion of fans won't be disappointed because this is more like the earlier works of \\"The Master\\".  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B00B2DSIAI|4|Hilarious!
B0055S348W|5|I never write reviews, but I am so happy with this app that I had to.  My biggest disappointment with the kindle is the inability to easily print as with my iPhone. I decided to try this (used the free test version to see if it would work first)  and was blown away by how easy the set up was.  Basically hit a few continue and ok buttons and I printed on my local HP laser over my network Wi-Fi.  That was it<br /><br />The app is a bit pricey, but it is worth every penny of avoided frustration
B0000640VN|2|2 1/2 stars to this light-weight comedy/romance.  It is harmless enough, and is cute, but there is little new material here.  Meg Ryan ignores the man from the past and is too busy to see him for who he really is until her eyes are magically opened to his true nature as her dream guy.  Cut plot, and a decent date movie, but it won't make anyone's top 10 list in any category.
B00AH3DCAA|5|So far this product is spot on and is keeping excellent time although I've only had it for less than two weeks.<br />However, I have a question... How is it that I paid $354.99 before shipping and now the same watch is listed here for $269.99 ? May end up sending this one back. Not too happy right now and it would be nice to hear from someone about this.
B00127RAJY|5|Really good video. It kicked my butt, burned a lot after the first day and had to rest for a day.
B00A6N8F4Y|4|This is a great action/thriller - nothing deep or profound - just good entertainment. It also had a less than predictable ending which is always nice. I'm not a fan of Travolta or Del Toro, fortunately they played bastards so it was appropriate to hate them.
B00APW2U88|5|Exactly what I expected.
B00729GQ0A|5|Lately I have found it hard to find a book worth reading. It seems that the market is flooded with so many books that are so similar, it's hard to find a book that is fresh and enlightening. The Forever Girl is one of those rare books that creates a world of fantasy that you just can't put down. Well written and easy flowing, you will find yourself lost in Sophia's world. If you love paranormal/fantasy, this book will not disappoint. I will recommend it to all my friends.

B000G7599Y|5|I got this set by chance. It was through the end-of-year reduction of 2008 (also, sadly, owning to the economic slowdown sweeping the world) that I found this collection particularly affordable. As a multi-year music listener, Böhm's renowned interpretation of Mozart's last six symphonies has been drawing my frequent returning to, however, when it comes to his early compositions, it was my serious consideration whether the whole set was worth buying had there not been any reduction.    Concerning musicology and discography, Mozart's symphonies are difficult to number and categorize, for many of them were composed when the genre had not received a definite character, which by following Haydn's path Mozart had helped to establish and prepare the coming of Beethoven's unsurpassable nine (though I would argue that Mozart's last three are the veritable incarnation of depth, loftiness, and brightness, from nowhere but Olympus could such music come).    As it happened, I was proved worrying too much. Whether in artistic or technical sense, this set deserves a wholehearted recommendation, and of course the price cut made it an over-qualified bargain. Going from the first to the last disc, we are presented an incredible panorama of how a great musical genius had been growing. Light and entertaining in the beginning (indeed many of his serenades and divertimentos are inseparable from the symphonies), through structure-widening and content-complicating phases, to the final sublimation which is robust and delicate, immense and clear. However, from A to Z they are perfectly satisfying, to which Karl Böhm and Berliner Philharmoniker are great contributors.    Given in a fine set which celebrated the 250th anniversary of Mozart, this set is great inside and tasteful in outer appearance as well. I bought it with another set also under Karl Böhm's baton, that is, Mozart's wind concertos and serenades. Together they marked my happy ending of 2008. Hope you also get one by good chance and in good humor.
B00005YXZH|2|So, everyone's favorite somnambulist grunge muswell hills hero tells us now that he has been addicted to painkillers. I, for one, am not surprised! Summerteeth is the one worthwhile record this band has produced, with sounds from eno, lennon, brian wilson and others blended together in an off-kilter formalism of subverted swagger. But this record? Please! If your in love with the idea of loving Wilco than love this too! Otherwise, steer clear of the pretension and the passionless pedantry. Get Spoon fed or borrow Ian Hunter's lead (as in better dead than read).

B00008H2LB|5|Hello, I am your tipical rock fan. I lean towards more--old stuff, ie Led Zeppelin, Beatles, Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, but I do enjoy an occasional dose of the newer stuff, ie Disturbed, Linkin Park, and some others.<BR>Lets look at all of these 1-Star reviews. Tisk, Tisk, Tisk. Nothing but bashing--for no damned reason, too. &quot;Stinkin Park!&quot; I've heard some yell. &quot;Anyone who picks up this album is obviously special&quot; others cry. And, of course &quot;LINCOLN PARK IS TEH SUCK!!!&quot; some of the idiots declare.<BR>This album, in my opinion, is a nice balance of hip-hop (I dare not call it rap [I don't like rap, much]) and rock. Each song is different, in one way or another, and that is a good thing.<BR>Enigma gives this album a 5---outta 5.
B0084B5TK8|5|Now that it is easy and very inexpensive, I thought that it was time to stock up on all those classics that I haven't read or read a long time ago. Dracula was surprisingly entertaining, and in a style that I was not expecting. Really worth reading the first time and rereading if you have already read it.

B000HVHM5S|5|I like the movie and there was no issue with the stream.
B009OYTIXS|3|Firstly, I watch this show on Hulu, not Amazon, and if I had to pay for it, I wouldn't watch it.  The writing's ok, the story's ok, but some of the delivery is pretty cheesy, especially by the main character.<br />I don't watch it for him, tho, but for Paul Blackthorne.  He's got a too-small part as the lead police detective hunting \\"the vigilante.\\"  I'm hoping that one of these days one of his shows will stick around!  I loved him in the \\"Dresden Files\\" show on the SciFi channel (before it became \\"Syfy\\" whatever THAT means), and have tried to catch whatever shows he's landed on since then.  None have been as good, IMHO, (tho \\"The River\\" was quite interesting) and none made it big, but one still hopes...<br />I do also like the main bad dude, who used to play Captain Jack on \\"Dr. Who\\" & \\"Torchwood,\\" and interestingly, in the most recent episode, *spoilers* there was a new character with another Whovian.  Can't wait to see how that develops!  :)
B0017I1IZA|5|Loved this book, it was more classic Plum and a good story with another psycho thrown in for good measure! I got a lotta Lula and Steph laughs out of this one!
B00005JNBQ|5|I loved this movie. I think that it is one of those films you either love or hate. I rented it on the premise of all the merchandise that everyone is sporting. I feel in love with all of the characters. Kip is my favorite. I think that this is a film that shows how people envision themselves. As one reviewer stated, Napoleon ( and Pedro for that fact) does not see himself as a geek.He does what he does because he is Napoleon. Some of my favorite parts are with Tina the llama ( I don't know why-I guess there was a time when we all hated to feed the pet llama), and any scene with Kip especially Kip and Lafawnda. This movie is a wonderful fun film. Don't take it seriously.

0446615625|3|I have been reading a lot, since I was a teenager.  And since I got my first Kindle 3 years ago, the obsession has only grown.  Thus, books come up often in conversation, and many a book lover has recommended \\"Baldacci.\\"  One friend loaned me a Baldacci book with the caveat that I must read Camel Club first.  So I went to my Kindle and quickly downloaded \\"Camel Club\\"<br /><br />I could not be more disappointed.  Baldacci wants us to believe that the CIA / FBI and every other government investigative department each have their own secret departments and rogue elements.  And these folks, along with a small group of disenfranchised misfits have never met a conspiracy theory they didn't love.  Each and every character has a John Wayne complex and armed with the truth and the means to achieve their truth they will righteously break any and all laws necessary - Think Ollie North.<br /><br />Then are the other guys who will barter or screw up any and all Governments if the price is right.<br />Once James Fennimore Cooper wrote about happy loner outcasts who quietly, guarded their land and honor.  Baldacci has hundreds of spies and war merchants who want to either bring the world to nuclear holocaust, or not depending on their political views.<br /><br />This book is layer upon layer of dots some connected, some not - Rambos - and suicide bombers.  One wonders why the world is not in flames.  After the first 20% the book does move rather quickly, but none of it is fun or believable.  I would recommend Ken Follet, Jeffrey Archer, Pat Conroy  or Dennis Lehane a thousand times before recommending Baldacci.  And never pass over \\"Destiny of the Republic\\" or \\"The Greater Journey\\" and \\"Brave Companions\\" (just saying)<br />Also, the Kindle offers many great authors for FREE - Austen, Dickens, Cooper, Conan-Doyle - go for any of these.<br />And for kicks: as for me, give me Harry Potter or Twilight!
B005LJITS0|2|If this isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, it comes awfully close.  Predictable to the point of cliche.  Decent (but not great) effects.  Not a single surprise. So-so soundtrack.  I haven't been so disappointed in a movie since \\"the incredible hulk\\" was previewed when the first Spiderman came out. Best part about the movie on demand is that I was able to resist instance purchase for 14.99 and go with the 24 hr. rental.  I saved eleven bucks!  Woo hoo!

B004JHYRYU|5|The movie and book are two different animals and they are both masterpieces and can both stand on their own.<br />The book is presented in three story-lines, independent and intersecting at the same time.  That much character development would not have made a good movie.<br />The story lines of Hana, Kip and Caravaggio are as unique and interesting as that of the English patient whose story brings them all together and intersect.  While the Drama of each of their lives could be a story in itself and the specificity of the English patient, strangely, is not even needed to for they story arch...it could have been other things...but the saga of the English patient and the mystery of his life and identity interweaves and drives their more mundane life struggles.  It's story, story, story and the English patient's narrative is a powerful driver.<br /><br />Missing or short-changed in the movie are the deeper story of Hana dealing with the trauma of her father's death, Kip's story of trying to navigate the fallout of colonialism, assimilation, identity and the east-west divide, and Caravaggio's (who's character, along with Hana first appear in a previous book &#34; &#34;In the Skin of a Lion&#34;-they really did grow up together in Canada) who relationship with Hana is infused with tenderness but is confusing to Hana because of unresolved family relationships she is still sorting out...and sought out Hana in Italy (not the English patient-but there are connections there they turn up).<br /><br />Don't skip the book...it is a good read with characters of depth that you don't often encounter.
B0083GQKQG|5|I just finished this movie about a minute ago and I had to write a review. This movie is absolutely terrifying. We get to know each and every character like they are our own family, and we see what they are going through. We feel the pain of the mother, the complete oblivion in the father, the total innocence of the little daughter, the pure hatred and hurt in the townspeople, and last but not least, the absolute evil in Kevin. This is not just a plain old movie about a messed up kid you guys, this is special. The movie creates an attachment between the viewer and characters immediately, combined with outstanding performances by the actors. This is one that I would highly recommend to not all viewers, but those who seek a movie that evokes very deep feelings and emotions.

B005Q1W10A|5|If you're wondering if Season 2 is up to the high standards of Season 1, then rest assured the cast remains the same, the gorgeous photography remains the same, the writing is still Julian Fellowes, and the extraordinary study of the class system in England at the beginning of the last century is intact.<br /><br />As we were informed in the last episode of Season 1, World War I has begun and this adds a new set of circumstances to the Abbey upstairs and downstairs. There is considerable dialogue about the desire vs. the fear of going to war, and the British military strips many of the Abbey's dwellers for the greed of the war. Footman Thomas goes off as a medic, is unable to endure the stress, gets himself shot by the enemy, and moves back to the neighboring hospital to Downton Abbey as a nurse. There he cares for a blinded victim and his efforts are rewarded by being placed in charge of the newly formed/transformed Downton Abbey Convalescent Hospital. Lady Sybil continues her feminist beliefs and trains to be a nurse, Lady Edith has all but given up on finding a husband and so learns to drive a tractor for the farmer whose life was saved in the last season and also becomes involved as a nurse, Lady Mary still struggles with her on again/off again desire for solicitor Matthew, Carson still rules the roost, Bates' distant wife appears and causes Bates to leave Downton much to Anna's displeasure and the disappointment of the entire staff and owners , and the entire season continues to be influenced by the steady performance of Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess of Grantham!<br /><br />The war affects the family of the Abbey in many ways, not the least of which is the loss of William whose valor saves Matthew from dying on the battlefield.  Lady Mary's secret liaison/tragedy still haunts her and directs her toward an unwanted journalist Richard Carlisle who blackmails her into promising to marry him (Lady Mary still loves Matthew despite Matthew's move from invalid due to his injury to his decision to marry Lavinia.

0345803485|1|I heard this book referred to as \\"porn for women\\" so I was expecting something very hot and explicit.  My expectations were not met.  To me, this book was no more explicit than a typical Jackie Collins novel, and the story wasn't even as involving.  Plus the ending was lame and chopped off.<br /><br />Worse yet, the Kindle price is higher than the regular book price.  What is up with that?
B006L9B6TI|4|With many of Rhonda Byrne books. This is another book that inspires you in Guideness and lessons to apply and learn in your daily life.
B001G70M6S|5|I came across an old Polaroid 210 Land Camera. This film is great very forgiving with latitude and has a wonderfully tight grain. Perfect in its contrast dark dark blacks and brilliant whites. Very fun film to shoot with.
B00EVW0SA0|2|Forget logic and reason. Forget anything that makes sense. Now you can enjoy the film.
B00992CF6W|1|this version does not even have signs yet and probly the suckyest nether ever all it is is a room with pigman in it they will not be able to have a lot of updates because they do not want to take up all of your gb
B00C1BV9Z6|5|How could you not love this movie. My 7 yr old watched it for the first time and she loved it!<br />The quality and sound is great!
6304539282|5|Hey, folks, BUY THIS VIDEOS.  I strongly congratulate Lucas for this wonder.  I really love this movies and recommend them to everybody. All three are masterworks and, in my opinion, this saga is the best of all  time. Buy it and enjoy.
B0000DD7LC|5|If you love her debut cd you will really love this cd. Alicia Keys The Diary of Alicia Keys is off the hook. From beginning to end this is a beautiful cd. The singing and songwriting is excellant. Love the classical piano undertones and the use of real instruments. Miss Keys even had the help of Toni Tony Ton'e, Kayne West and Timbaland. I see more Grammies in her future.
B00A81MV3U|5|This is an extremely well done film, with terrific performances by the star trio of Brad Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, and Robert De Niro, and excellent character scenes, especially those with John Ortiz and Chris Tucker.  Anupam Kher was also excellent as Dr. Patel.  The pacing was excellent, and helped to make the theme easier to take, and it isn't an easy theme.  In many ways, the entire film is in the form of variations on therapy.  The main character is bipolar, and authentically resists taking lithium.  Dramatic scenes between Cooper and Lawrence often resemble  breakthroughs in therapy.  Pat Jr's father played by De Niro seems to have similar issues, and bipolarity tends to run in families. One of the twists that I especially like about this film is that it follows the form of a typical sports-based film, but the final &#34;game&#34; isn't football or baseball.  Lawrence as Tiffany is sharp and quick, and a perfect complement to Cooper's often hypomanic Pat The film has intensity and heart, and a moving ending.  I wanted to see it because a review mentioned a creative over-the-shoulder sequence.  It is also au courrant with steadycam technique.  But I love the way the film manages to make a romcom at the same time that it provides a fairly authentic presentation of issues in bipolarity!

B00AB7HESI|5|Creativity, replay value and fun combined into one game.  Quite original game.  You are only limited by your imagination.  Worth paying for it.
B008EKOIN8|4|Great insights into how and why we cook as we do.
0395389496|5|If you love your children get this book and read it to them -- over and over again. We got ours when it first came out and before it had won awards or been recognized for the wonderful book that it is. It will be read again on December 23 this year ('Twas The Night Before Christmas has a lock on Christmas Eve). All of my children and now my grandchildren love it and all but the youngest have it memorized. The sweetness of the minds and hearts of the little ones themselves is the only thing on earth that is better than this story. In case you cannot tell, I truly believe.
B000NU2CY4|5|I have loved this movie since the first time I saw it and now it is out on blu-ray! Awesome! If you loved the original, you will be so happy with this copy. I highly recommend it for anyone's collection.

1907360018|5|This is one of the best books you will ever read. It ranges from children to adults. This book was exceptionally great because it is a collectors edition. Can't wait to get more like.
B0044RC12A|5|I really love the characters ready to buy the next season. Also love that the season are inexpensive to buy
B004XDYJRU|5|I can listen to everything from my local PBS station to the BBC. BBC 4 Extra is perfect when I can't sleep. Dramas and comedies in the middle of the night. I think it's the best Kindle product I've got.

B00JPCCJFS|4|Another gem from one of my favorite authors. I think this one was a little slower than the two previous ones, but a wonderful read nevertheless.
1594633665|5|This book is a real page turner. There is not one part of this book that is boring or slow in terms of plot. Hawkins does a great job with character development, I feel we got to get into the minds of each and every character, and the fact that it is written from the point of view of the 3 main women characters keeps it interesting. The entire plot was suspenseful and engaging, I found myself constantly wanting to know more and to put the pieces of the puzzle together. All 3 women narrators couldn't be more different from one another, or so it seems, until the story goes on and we find that they may not be so different from each other after all in some aspects. This book has it all; marriage, divorce, lust, romance, psychological thrills. It shows how things aren't always what they seem. You won't be disappointed!! A must read!!
B000005RU2|5|oh yeah....THIS is why I always liked Purple more than Led Zep, nothing against Zep mind you. This has got to be one of the all time great live recordings by a rock band. For me, 'Highway Star' says it all. This version makes the one on MACHINE HEAD pale by comparison, and that WAS a good version! They are simply firing on all cylinders on this track, the big Purple sound in all its glory.<br /><br />Jon Lord is one of my all time favorite Hammond players, he just makes the damn thing breath fire. His playing on this track and CD just goes to confirm why the Hammond organ, in the right hands, is one of the greatest instruments ever created. It is such a powerful instrument and Lord takes full advantage. He was the X factor in this band, the perfect compliment to Blackmore's fiery guitar work, what a duo! Gillan's voice is in great form and what can I say about Ian Paice on drums, one of my favorite drummers ever since I was turned on to the IN ROCK recording way back when. And of course, Roger Glover is the glue that holds it all together. For me, they just don't make bands like this anymore. The MKII version remains one of my favorite bands beacuse I loved the songs and they had the musical chops to back it up. THIS is what good, solid hard rock music is all about. Oh yeah, one of the highlights of my life was to actually meet and talk with Ritchie Blackmore back in the 80's. Crank this bad boy up and stand back, no turkey is served here, LONG LIVE PURPLE!!!<br /><br />[...]
B0027BOL4G|5|Food Inc. is a great documentary about agribusiness in America. The film traces the negative effects of the way these companies do business from your plate all the way back to the factory farms and petri dishes. Authors Michael Pollan and Eric Schlosser are among the people shedding light on the corporate controlled American food industry. It is not an easy film to watch, but it is important to see how your food gets to your table.

B004XQYBA2|5|I love this game.<br />And if you like to play Sudoku as well then you will love this app.<br />You will never need another sudoku book or app again.<br /><br />When you start the app it generates a huge amount of sudokus.<br />You can choose from 8 different difficulties from Very easy to Nightmare.<br /><br />There are also variants next to the classic Sudoku, like Jigsaw Sudoku and Percent Sudoku.<br />But even if you are only interested in playing the classic Sudoku game and you only want to play one difficulty level there is no reason to ever get another Sudoku book or app again. This game will always fulfill all your Sudoku needs.<br /><br />The app is highly customize-able if you want.<br />You can start a Sudoku, get stuck, stop and start a new one and then later go back to the one you got stuck on.<br /><br />I personally love this app and it is without a doubt my favorite game on my phone.<br />If you like Sudoku then get this game!

B009ZQ8FQG|5|Loved every minute!
B0051ANPZQ|5|Well written and thought provoking. A great read for children and adults. As a teacher, I highly recommend that this book be a part of the classroom library.
0439023483|5|I was looking for something else to read after I got done with Twilight and the Wicked Lovely series and this fit the bill.  I absolutely loved this series.  They have suspense, romance, and a bit of the supernatural.  The author does an amazing job with character developement, visual expression and keeping you on the edge of your seat.  Just when you think you have it all figured out, she throws in a twist.  I also liked that the main character Katniss wasn't a damsel in distress.  Although she had self doubts (like anyone would) she didn't give up or wait on someone else to rescue her.  This is a great story of courage, growing up, and survival of the fittest.
B004LDLI0S|4|I liked to read it because is pure History. We can get into the mind of one that was, and is indeed, controversial leader of the XX century
B007PT3QOQ|4|I like the game really well minus 2complaints. 1.  You can move things around to reposition to make room. 2. You use up your energy to fast.  So they imply the game is free but if you really wabt to have fun with it you are going to need cash.
B003MC5N28|5|interesting, thoughtful read-----It is a good idea to read the book before viewing the movie.  Although the book and the movie relate the same story, the movie is quite different with much less detailed.
0763668966|5|This book is fabulous and my granddaughters love it! I will be excited to get the workbooks to accompany the books.
B00F1BFRA6|5|I couldn't wait to see how the season ended and now I cannot wait for Season 5.  So glad Amazon has this prior to the end of the television viewing season.
B00005JL0I|5|Those who say they don't get the plot have missed the point: there isn't one!  This movie is meant to be absurd and make you laugh at the total incongruity of it all.  When the brass come to bring James Bond out of retirement he's a stuttering nutball; when he gets back to headquarters and Moneypenny, he asks \\"Have you noticed me stammering since I got here?\\"  She replies, \\"No.\\"  He says \\"Good.  Let me know if you do, I haven't got time for that now.\\"  And so it goes.  If you're expecting coherence, you won't find it here.  If you want to laugh yourself silly, this is the place to be.  And Woody Allen plays Bond's nephew, not his son.I consider this one ofthe funniest movies of all timeIf you can't enjoy this flick, you are taking yourself far too seriously.
B000X8KGQM|5|One of my favorite film soundtracks. He creates a world of sound. A pan flute, an oboe and young male soprano voice are the key characters in this unique soundscape. Recognizable motifs are developed and expanded and he really takes you on a journey. I never thought a pan flute sound could evoke the kind of emotion it does here. The thing is played beautifully and savagely. The singing of the oboe and the use of the boy's voice-as-instrument work together to haunting effect. Get to know the N -E -O.
B00AIUUXHC|5|it is so fun. get.it takes about a couple days to get all the sharks.I loooooooove it(I love it) so fun you can get.
B00HGJ18C2|4|Very challenging with some different options.  I like the options of  trying the same shuffle again or choosing a new game.  There are a few that seems impossible to win, but I like the challenge of trying several different moves to accomplish victory.
B002KQ6BT6|1|The Da Vinci Code was insulting to the educated reader.  This book is just plain insulting.  Apparently the American public can be easily duped into believing that Masons are evil when, in fact, as Dan Brown makes sure we all know ad nauseam, the Masons are godlike and the saviors of the free world.  The book simply has a silly premise, bland characters, and mediocre prose.  I can forgive the prose if I care about the story, but this story is just too silly.  A female scientist sits in her top secret lab, so well protected only her assistant and her brother know how to get in.  She gets a text message telling her to trust a complete stranger and let him into the lab, so she does.  Really?  And that's just the beginning of a series of incredibly foolish actions taken by people who are supposed to be really smart.   Remind me to never trust the hero, Langdon, with anything important - that exceedingly important box - the one that was generations old - the one Peter trusted him to keep safe; well, apparently Langdon had is kicking around his house ready to toss into a backpack based on the word of, oh yes, a complete stranger.

B00DR0PDNE|4|Managed to get the last Chromecast from my local BB (an associate had hidden one under the counter but gave it up). They had sold 43 in one day. A few minutes fiddling with the proper inputs and, using my Samsung Skyrocket III as the controller, I had it going. I plugged it into an HDMI port on my home theater receiver, then ran an HDMI cable from that to an HDMI input on my TV. That way I can use my Logitech Harmony One remote to switch from my cable box to the Chromecast and use the Harmony One to control volume and switch back to other sources later. I still need to use the phone to start Netflix. This gadget may allow me to shut down my home theater PC, which, since it uses a VGA input, has not quite as nice a picture as the HDMI inputs. For now, the HTPC does allow use of other video browser sites like Project Free TV for the stuff that is not on Netflix. Setup was easy. You have to download the Chromecast application from the Google Play Store, but my Netflix and You Tube apps were already up to date for selecting the Chromecast. The Harmony One did not have the Chromecast as a device, but I used the earlier Google TV object and just changed the name. Since there is no controller for the Chromecast, the Harmony One only needed to set the receiver and TV to the proper inputs.
B003JYOEYM|2|I wanted SO much to like this. I was so excited to sit down and watch it (even after paying the ridiculous $10 rental fee on Xbox's Zune). I LOVED Dawn and Day of the Dead, liked Land of the Dead and thought Diary of the Dead was...eh...ok. I'm a pretty big Zombie movie fanatic. 2004's Dawn of the Dead Remake by Zack  Snyder is probably at the top of my list, followed very closely by the original Day of the Dead. Shawn of the Dead was fantastic, but in a different way.    I'm not sure what George Romero was thinking here. This movie is just disjointed. It wants to be so many different things, thus detracting from any one theme. The story is really weird, kind of awkward. It's a Zombie movie, but almost as an afterthought. It's almost like Romero wanted to write an entirely different movie but felt obligated to stick to the genre he's known for.     There's this weird Hatfield vs. The McCoys story weaved into the well known end of the world Zombie stuff, but I just kept asking myself what the point was. It's just not interesting. I would much rather have seen a not so unfamiliar story (a band of survivors holes up somewhere to fend of the undead hordes) with more focus on how the characters feel and communicate in response to the zombies and the fact that the world is ending, not some lame, overly complicated back story that no average person can relate to . This approach worked wonderfully in Snyder's DoTD remake, and even in the original Dawn. I mean I really sympathized with those characters, where as in this film I could have cared less and just wanted the weird \\"family feud\\" stuff to be over.     And please, George, just let Zombies be dumb, mindless eating machines. I know you're really into allegory and zombie evolution but stop over-thinking. Zombies are Zombies. That's what makes them scary and why we love 'em. The horse-riding Zombie was just too much. And the ending gave me a stomach  ache.    As far as the production, there are some really disappointing moments. Day of the Dead, which was made 25 years ago looks far more real and gory than this film. I just cannot get used to CG zombie fx. The scene with the zombie heads on the pikes is pathetic. Some of the physical effects look great, but the poorly done shots really take you out of the film. It must have been budgetary. You really get what you pay for. It is shot well, and the music is good. One particular complaint I have (and maybe because I'm a sound designer for TV and Film), is that a lot of the gunshots sound wimpy. Gunshots in films should be loud and jarring, especially during relatively quiet scenes. A lot of the gunshots in this film (and there are a TON) are mixed at conversation volume. WTF?    Overall, very disappointing in my opinion. I'll be interested to see what the consensus turns out to be. I gave it 2 stars because it looks good and is well acted.
0553208845|5|This voyage through the life of Siddartha is a fascinating and complex work.  Hesse takes the reader through the choices that comprise the life of Siddartha, a young Indian man seeking peace.  Siddartha will only make choices that are is own.  As quoted in the book, Wisdom is not communicable.  Even if his father or Gotama the Buddha has previously learned the lessons he is seeking to know they cannot simply communicate that wisdom to him, he must carve his own path.<br />First Siddartha leaves his father to live an ascetic life, later he looks to hear the wisdom of Gotama who has achieved Nirvana or in other words found peace and truth.  He spends time learning about the life of physical lusts.  He finds Kamala to teach him about love and begins to eat fine food and wear expensive apparel.  This cannot satisfy him and he leaves this life to help a old man Vasudeva ferry travelers across a river.<br />Eventually he finds that he has a son with Kamala and this son follows in his footsteps by leaving on his own path.  His son cannot handle the simple life of Siddartha and returns to the life he knew with his mother Kamala.  Through all of these experiences, I believe that Siddartha learned the greatest lesson of life and achieved what he was searching for.  It is unfortunate I cannot understand completely what he is trying to communicate to me, because it is wisdom.  However I was moved by what he had to say and I believe you will be affected profoundly as well.  So read the book, it is a 3 hour read and a very pleasant one at that.
B001B3BTLO|5|In a royal blue, cloth-covered slipcase reminiscent of denim. The book itself is bound 3/4's denim with a brown leather spine with dark brown details.

B0098XY5VK|4|I enjoy this game when I want to do a busy activity.  It makes me giggle which is always a good thing.
B00013PHGS|3|I won't even go about the music which is OK but the freaking copy protection prevents the disc from being played on my computer. If Air and other artists want to be alienated in this way by lining behind the record labels then it is fine but this is the first AND last copy controlled disc I buy. And this is from someone that foolishly shelves the cash for legal software instead of downloading/borrowing/ripping/stealing/whatever they want to call it.
B000050XEI|5|Exceptional daydreaming music. I first heard this album cleaning house for a client and got lost in a daydream of raindrops and ballerinas. I had heard of Enya before, but I think the only song I was familiar with was Orinoco Flow. After hearing this album I went on a quest to collect all of her music, but I always come back to this album. I would say it is her best album, every track is enjoyable.
1592401791|4|A great story for those who are interested in how records are made. Emerick makes you feel like you're in the little recording room with the Beatles as he explains how they created certain sounds. As he describes those songs you've heard a thousand times, you'll gain new insight on the sounds you've taken for granted (for example the innovative steps required to create the bass sound on Paperback Writer). There is some coverage of the personalities and the infighting, but only to the extent necessary to decribe how it affected the recording/writing process. <br />My only disappointment in the book was the surpisingly brief description of the process of recording the Free As a Bird & Real Love tracks for the Beatles Anthology. Given the unique situation of recording Lennon songs without Lennon, there's little discussion of the engineering and production - only a description of the vibe and the mood as they worked on it. That bit aside, a great story about groundbreaking achievements in recording as well as songwriting.
0763660531|5|Although this book lacked words, the vivid pictures left ample room for the imagination to roam. My five year old son had a wonderful time coming up with his own story to go along with the pictures. This wasn't a bedtime favorite, but it was a fun book!
B00AK0X5VQ|5|Challenging and rewarding, the harder the puzzle the prettier
B00I2TV3NO|3|Disappointed. As a sequel to Hunger Games, I found it was more of the same. Poorly written, poorly directed, poorly acted, and somewhat choppy in the films flow, so poorly edited too. Nonetheless, the special effects were well done. I read Hunger Games and liked it, but I haven't read Catching Fire, so problem could be the book itself. All said, this sequel is simply an interim stretch. I hope the final episode is significantly better, but I'm not holding my breath.
B004FGMDOQ|5|Although different from what I usually read, I really grew to like this book more and more as I continued to read.
B009LXEBD4|5|Love Kelly Clarkson so I had to have this CD!  Really happy to have all the songs I love and ones I didn't realize I loved all on one CD.
B004GYY714|5|I live in an area where reception of FM is blocked by a mountain.  TuneIn Radio has moved the mountain for me, bringing all my local stations into my home.  But the best thing is how easy it to listen to ANYTHING!  The interface is simple to set up your favorites from all over the world.  Jazz from Chicago, talk shows from New York, sports from anywhere your team plays called by the local sportscasters.  Go for it!
B005PK56TA|5|great series to watch if your like creepy stories
B00OKYQZDI|4|Sometimes the game has impossible moves and takes longer to finish the level than necessary
B0035S996U|5|This is easily one of the best movies of the 1970s. Indeed, it could only have been made in the 1970s. Loosely based on the Anabasis of Xenophon, The Warriors follows the eponymous gang as they fight their way from the Bronx to Coney Island, after being accused of shooting Cyrus, president of the most powerful gang in New York. The gang is hounded by the likes of the Turnbull ACs, the Baseball Furies, and the Rogues, all colorful looks at an imagined urban underworld that again, could only have been inspired by the culture of the 1970s.<br /><br />Eminently quotable (&#34;Can... you... DIG IT!?&#34;), and a fun ride from beginning to end, The Warriors deserves its place as one of the great cult movies.
B00319ECGK|5|What can I say that hasn't been already been said about The Matrix? It truly is a one of a kind film for the sci-fi and cyberpunk genre. That's why for this I am sticking to strictly the Blu-Ray and it's product quality. This disc is full of special features including intriguing features including, behind the scenes making, visual effects, Directors' commentary and many more. The film has been remaster from the original 35mm prints and has been upgraded to 1080p and 5.1 surround for the best film experience. The picture is just as clear as ever with this remaster and the sound is so crisp, I was able to hear every gunshot in crisp detail during the famous lobby shootout. All these scenes pop and it feels so good to see a classic given the proper BR treatment and for the right price. This is a must for any, sci-fi, film or just anyone who is a fan of this film.
B005COO1X6|1|This is a short story and the first third  of the yarn is just \\"ok\\"...while the remainder  is CRUD...silly....stupid. I agree with the  other one-star reviewers.
B00DUGCLY4|5|It's fun and yeah
B000007XUQ|5|Mesmerizing.  What beautiful work; glorious arrangements and heavenly production sung by the voice of an angel!  Superb!
B00B2TUKI0|2|Peyroux brings nothing new to most of these songs, which have been endlessly covered.  I have heard more interesting versions of many sung by lounge singers.  And the strings - good grief, the strings.  From time to time, a few tasty licks from the backing musicians, but the producer made sure that mostly they didn't interact with the vocals.  The song selection is beyond puzzling: what WAS she thinking?  Cohen's \\"Bird on the Wire\\" seemed to go on forever, its brilliant lyrics ground into submission by a lifeless recitation.  What a disappointment.
B00KKIRYYC|5|Good game
B005IQZB14|4|I couldn't put this book down. It was an interesting story of one woman's journey through grief. Although I've also read some negatve reviews, I thought it was commendable for the author to put her heart and soul on the page.
B00G3L6KQI|4|I really enjoyed all 3 books. The Book of Life did a good job of answering questions from the previous books. But I hope there is more to come. This is listed as a trilogy but it left with a lot of questions. I hope there is more! Otherwise I really enjoyed it. I couldn't put it down.
B00DU77QP2|5|Amaizing, the only book that makes you ship incest. I love it, and I know that you will love it too
0316219266|4|I found it very interesting to learn more about of the history of Amazon - some of it not very flattering. I was surprised by the story later in the book about the bicycle shop owner. Gave me pause for thought. I'm glad the book is being sold on Amazon.<br /><br />This book helped me understand how Amazon became what it is.
B003O86FMW|5|When I first purchased The Hunger Games, I had no idea what to expect. But I was pleasantly surprised. Although it was not my usual read, I thought something different would be enjoyable. I couldn't put it down! Then, Catching Fire came and it, too, was a white-knuckler. I could hardly wait to get the third book in the Triology, The Mockinjay.<br />Last night, while watching TV - I noticed an advertisement for an upcoming movie. The names and plot caught my attention immediatly and I learned that it was The Hunger Games. I CAN'T WAIT to go and see it!!!<br />Take a chance - try something new - you won't regret getting this trilogy!
B00QW8TYWO|5|This is a great app that has the right amount of challenging, easy , creativity , and fun.Works great on Kindles. Sometimes you get a character you already have from the prize machine.

During that scene I kept thinking, &#34;GO FIND A MACHINE!!&#34;  As long as you are traveling within Schengen, you won't even have to SHOW your passport.
B00F87ZUYG|5|Amazing cant wait for the rest of the season. Great way to waste time when there's not much to do.
0634022296|3|This book has all the songs and is very organized. It seems to have all the correct chords and the fingerings. However, it is unclear (or was to me) that this only has chords, and doesn't have tablature. If you really want to learn how to play the songs like the Beatles, tabs are the way to go. If all you want is chords, this is the book for you. But if you really want to get the songs down, I would go for something different.
B008AK8FHM|5|It is inspirational to hear that there is a link between science and spirituality. Although I can feel the frustration of the author trying to express the beauty and love he experienced, it is comforting to hear about his experience.  I appreciate his effort to relate to us what life beyond here is like.
B003ODIZL6|5|I really like this book because it is interesting.it is a surprise to me please send it to the other person then talk to me
B000002J2D|2|I really wanted to like this album because the opening track, Down and Out kicks butt.  There is some great material here - Undertow, Burning Rope, Snowbound and the opening song.  There is also some embarassingly bad material.  When I played the LP for a friend way back when I had it on vinyl, he heard the words ' all-star indian tribe' from Ballad of Big and started laughing. Yawns also to The Lady Lies, Deep in the Motherlode, Say it's Alright Joe, Follow you, etc etc..  Duke was the only album to appear from this period which had more than 50% good songs on it.  Sad end for a great band.  Don't even get me started on Abacab.
B0001BKAEY|2|I liked the first Matrix film because of the music, the action and the special effects.  It had a few weaknesses in the storyline and the science of the Matrix was substandard even for a sci-fi movie, but it was a great action movie and that made it fun.   <br /> <br />The second and third movies had the action that made the first movie great, but they seemed like fanfiction - like those books Kevin J. Anderson wrote based on the Star Wars movies.  I simply couldn't buy Keanu Reeves and Hugo Weaving fighting for control of the world and flying through the air.  It seemed kind of stupid.   <br /> <br />One of the weaknesses in the trilogy is that the strength of the first movie was Neo adjusting to living in the Matrix.  When the second movie started, he was suddenly Superman and it took away a lot of what made the character interesting.  To make things worse, the brothers focused too heavily on boring and sucky characters.
081095415X|5|I am not the most eloquent of people, but Nick Brandt's work tends to make me wax more lyrical than anything else does. My wife bought me his first book a few years ago, and I literally had tears in my eyes looking through the pages. I thought that Nick would be unable to top that book, but I was wrong.   A Shadow Falls is a masterpiece of photography, and brings those who look at these images closer to the soul of the animals than any Nat Geo show ever could. Each image feels like an intimate encounter, like it's just you, and the animal, alone in the wild. You can almost sense that they know you are looking at them. They are allowing you to be so close. It's personal.  Nick does not use zoom lenses, or telephotos, so all the images bring you right up where he was. The startling detail of the king of the beasts, the lion, or the majestic herds of elephants making their treks in search of water, portrayed in a manner that tells a story. They're not just photos, they're so much more.  As a musician (and part time photographer), I always ask people what 5 albums would they want to have on their iPod if they were stranded on a desert island. By the same token, I know what book I would want by my side should I ever find myself in that predicament.  A Shadow Falls.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Beautiful prose, wondrous and deep.  I am slightly annoyed that my review must be 15 words long when fewer words are better than verbosity, I find.  Nonetheless, This book is not to be missed.
B0084AXZK0|5|I read this many years ago and had forgotten about it. While looking for a different book, I ran across this &#34;Old Friend&#34; and just had to 're-visit' it. Just like I remembered it! Excellent Read!
B00DURGZHW|3|Overall a very GOOD movie, it kept me entertained, however; the plot was very shallow and at the end of the day I wish there was just more to the movie.  I would recommend watching it, but this will not be a repeat watching movie.
B003YHSE7W|5|This is a great action movie that looks and sounds excellent on blu ray. One cannot help to notice that with the single disc version you are getting a part of a full package. What I mean by this is that they did not design or even label discs differently for each version, making it seem more like an incomplete set rather than a stand alone disc. I got this for $5, so it Is well worth it if you don't need the extras. In short: Robert Downey Jr. as Iron man= 5 stars.
B0099Y2YL6|5|It is actually easier to follow through the episodes than the UK version I own. We watch it almost every two weeks.. Gets us away from our own problems for a short while.. I like the refined details  of blueray.
B00F8F3J2S|3|Blurbs were interesting.  Book less so.
B00DH4BL4U|4|Loved it, read it in one go on holiday. Recommend it. A football fan age 13 (boy) from Oslo ..
B00IDI7WP2|5|very enjoyable movie for all the family
B00340I4KG|4|A law enforcement officer and a criminal get their faces exchanged so they each have to act like each other. Interesting.
1577314808|5|This is one of the best books in the genre. A slow read for me, but there's a lot of new information to digest. Not the &#34;typical&#34;, & not for everyone. I tried to buy it years ago, but couldn't find it anywhere! It's been translated into 30 languages!!! That alone, speaks volumes! Highly recommend. ... This book stays on my nightstand, a must read! And, as usual, quick delivery from Amazon.
B008C20TDG|5|Love the book! Will review when I've done my 30 days! Hope it helps my husbands mysterious stomach pain and his sleep apnea!
B004XUMMFE|5|This series was well written and well acted. The video quality here is great. I can't recommend this show enough!
B00M8JCW3E|5|If you're a fan or not you will love this album! Her voice is as liquid as ever!
B00006J9OT|5|Great album. She brings a lot of old standards to life by giving them her own interpretation. The tunes are very upbeat. I keep the CD in my car, and enjoy listening to it when I am driving.
0374158460|1|This is the first Jonathan Franzen book I've read and will undoubtedly be the last.<br />Endless lectures on the environment and overpopulation combined with trite political swipes make this novel a bore.<br />Franzen's writing leaves a lot to be desired with far too much \\"explaining\\" throughout.<br />Seeing that this title was left off the short list for the National Book Award is a hopeful sign.<br />Maybe all the commercial hype and kneejerk adulation can't buy the prize after all.
B0002858YS|4|I'ld just like to say that this is not a bad little rock album, you can hear influences from The Pixies,The Cure, Bowie, Placebo, Suede, even U2 on occasion, with numerous other influences all through it. They wear these influences on their sleeves, that is for sure, but this album is a good little production all the same. The songs are quite good, and it should be noted that there is not many 'fillers' on the album at all, so you get your money's worth with this one.   The second or third playing really gets this album in its groove, and this album became a mainstay in my car stereo for several months after I first purchased it.  The Killers have made an excellent debut, and this album has turned out to be one of the best rock releases during the past year. I hope they can keep it up with subsequent works, and if this album is anything to go by the next one will be great as well.    Check it out for yourself to see what all the fuss is about!
B000000W6X|4|But then- it's practically impossible to top a perfect release.  Protection is Massive Attack's &quot;texture&quot; album, with a flow that makes the record come together, and several stand-out tracks.  It has a cool, jazzy feel not unlike a dimly-lit nightclub with people dancing, drinking, laughing and crying.  However, it uses less melody and more texture, creating more soundscapes than tunes.<br />Always a welcome addition is Tracey Thorn of Everything But the Girl.  &quot;Protection&quot; and &quot;Better Things,&quot; which she contributes to, are two of the album's best.  Also Nicolette, although a little shrill on &quot;Sly,&quot; is beautiful on &quot;Three.&quot;  Also- Massive Attack has proved that they can do instrumental tracks!  Unfortunately, Horace Andy only has one studio song, and he doesn't shine like he did on Blue Lines.  And &quot;Light My Fire?&quot;  It's a little annoying, although I admit it has grown on me.<br />More than ever, Massive Attack creates moods that creep up on you with each repeated listen.  However, Protection, while it has some of Massive's best songs, it disappoints a little as a whoe album.  Definitely essential to any collection, but better if you can find it used.
B00F8L2VO4|5|I love Duolingo.  I think this is a wonderful app and it is free! I have used Rosetta Stone but this is just as good if not better.
B008Y1YK0I|5|This was the film my wife and I saw on our first date back when you dressed up to go to the movies. It has remained a classic film over the years and has lost none of its excitement and greanduer with this released.  I'm pleased to see that they also included the musical intro and mid-film break.
B00L9B7IKE|4|The books are similar. I will be interested in seeing the movie. The characters were interesting enough. I was a little bit disappointed in the ending.  But all in all a good fast read.
B00MG4OXWO|5|Another great addition from Peter Jackson and Co. now I can't wait tell next year to purchase The Hobbit: The Battle of the 5 Army's (Extended Edition). Thank you Amazon for another great Movie, Statue Set.......My only fault with this set is that the statue looks a little more like Weta is not up to there standard great work and a little more like bad paint job........also did you just use regular Plastic in this, or Plastic Stone???
B000MR9D5E|5|Another ICONIC program brought to us by the prestigious BBC.  Just breathtaking and truly amazing images that totally describe our beautiful and amazing Planet Earth.  A must see and have in your DVD collection.
B005EY2XFC|5|Now this is a review in my 20 years ago reviews is a movie that I couldn't wait to talk about this is 20 years ago The Crow. I'll be honest I 1st heard about this movie on Unsolved Mysteries when they ran a story about the death of Brandon Lee who of course is The Son Of Bruce Lee both men died young Bruce in his early to mid 30's & Brandon died at 28. I won't get into any of the conspiracies I'll say they're interesting. Basically if you don't know Brandon Lee was shot on set by a 44 revolver & the bullet that hit him still had primer it still fired like a bullet & he died later that day. The movie almost not released cause Paramount backed out who were going to release the movie then Mrirmax got the rights most of the movie was complete but their were a few scenes needed to complete the movie like shots with The Eric Draven character it was released in 1994 a great year for movies. Made for $23 million made %50 million in The US made $94 million worldwide for a combined profit of $144 million. Directed by Alex Proyas he directed The Dark City & i Robot. Stars Brandon Lee as Eric Draven, Michael Wincott as Top Dollar, Rochelle Davis as Sarah & Ernie Hudson as Officer Albercht. Story is the night in before Halloween in Detroit is called Devil's Night due to property destruction & several fires set in the city by a Crime Organization led by Top Dollar. The movie starts off with Cops investigating a crime scene in an apartment where a couple have been killed named Eric Draven & Shelly Webster Eric was shot, stabbed & thrown out the window this group of thugs named T Bird, Tin Tin, Funboy &<br />S  k  an  k. They assaulted Shelly & beat her. Officer Albercht had Shelly taken to the hospital. He runs into this Skateboarding Girl named Sarah Eric & Shelly were Father & Mother figures for her cause she has no Father & her Mother is a dug addict & is with 1 of the men that killed Eric Shelly Funboy. A year later Eric Draven comes back from the dead along with a bird companion. Cause if 2 people love each other die under tragic circumstances & nothings been done 1 will come back to put the wrong things right. Eric is led to his old apartment you even have Eric & Shelly's Cat remember him he figures out what he has to do. Then you go to Officer Albercht who has really been taking care of Sarah T Bird & his gang attacked Arcade Games & have blown it up with the owner still inside. Draven has painted his face & when he's getting ready a really good son is playing \\"Burn\\" by The Cure. Eric finds this man named Tin Tin he confronts him he throws knives at Eric he catches them or throws them out of the way. He takes a knife & tells Tin Tin \\"Victim's aren't we all?\\" He messes up Tin bad. The villains in The Crow are entertaining they're in this bar & they yell \\"FIRE IT UP! FIRE IT UP!\\" They're putting bullets in their mouth & washing them down with their booze. The lead Villain Top Dollar played by Michael Wincott a guy that doesn't get who doesn't get any respect in Hollywood. He has some good lines when he's told by T Bird that Tin Tin has been killed Top Dollar says \\"Well gentlemen, by all means, I think we oughta have an introspective moment of silence for poor ol Tin Tin.\\" Or what he tells his Girlfriend-Sister when he has this Snow Globe \\"Dad gave me this 5th Birthday. He said Childhoods over the moment you know you're going to die.\\" Anyway you have Eric go to this Pawn Shop headed by a man named Gideon which criminals use this Pawn Shop to sell items they stole from their victims. Gideon shoots Eric his reaction to him not being harmed is very funny. Eric finds The Engagement Ring he gave Shelly & his old guitar which I like how character traits they keep for the character when they were alive. Eric points a Shotgun at Gideon he tells him everyone involved who killed him & Shelly. He pours gas all over the place he tells Gideon to tell that crew that death is coming for them he says \\"Tell them Eric Draven sends his regards.\\" Before heleaves he asks \\"is that gasoline I semll?\\" He fires The Shotgun at puddles of gas blowing up The Pawn Shop. The Police found Tin Tin & while looking around they find a Crow symbol in blood. Officer Alberct runs into Eric Draven he asks him if he likes his coat cause he got from Tin Tin he tells him \\"He was a friend that shouldn't have played with knives.\\" He tells him that Tin Tin & everyone in the gang is dead they just don't know it. That causes Officer Albercht to look into The Eric Draven & Shelly Webster murder case that hasn't been solved. Eric also saves Sarah from being ran over & she tells him that she wished it would stop raining he replies \\"It can't rain all the time.\\" Which was a song in Eric's bang Hangman's Joke. The Crow leads him to Funboy Where he & his Girlfriend Darla Sarah's Mom are getting high. Funboy pulls his gun out at Eric he puts his hand on the barrel & let's him shoot but he shows him that he can't be hurt. Eric has this telepathy power & uses it to Funboy feel the pain that he put them through. Funboy accidentally shoots himself he drags him to the bathroom where Darla comes at him with a straight razor he grabs her & gets through to her he cleanses her of the drugs in her system & he tells her to go home her Daughter is waiting for her she storms out of there Top Dollar's Right Hand Man checks on Funboy he finds him dead & he has all these needles in him with all these drugs injected to him. Top Dollar knows someone is after him Gideon tells him what happened to his Pawn Shop & Top Dollar's Right Hand Man tells him what happened to Funboy. Top Dollar kills Gideon. Eric chats with Officer Albercht he tells Eric that he stayed with Shelly until she died he hoped she would make it out of it so she could tell him something so he could arrest the people who did it. Eric uses his telepathy & he finds out he's telling the truth. T Bird &<br />S  k  an  k go to this Convince Store to get some smokes & beer while T Bird is in his Car Eric is waiting for him he puts a gun to his head & makes T Bird drive to the docks & S  k  an  k sees what's going on he runs out & is stuck by a car the motorist starts cussing him out he beats him up & steals his vehicle. The Police get into the chase. 1 thing leads to another The Cops &<br />S  k  an  k crash into each other. Eric tapes T Bird to the seat of the car he places an explosive between T Birds legs he puts the car in gear before it goes into the river it explodes in mid air then Eric leaves a flaming a Crow symbol  which if you read my Punisher 04 review I said they got the flaming skull idea from this movie. Officer Albercht is suspended for misconduct cause his superior thinks that he's in with the person killing all these gang members. Sarah & her Mom start to have normal relationship. S  k  a  nk has lost his mind after what happened to T Bird & this scene is funny he's running around yelling & Top Dollar says we oughta record this & play & play it back on slow mo. Top Dollar calls a meeting with all The Crime Bosses. Eric goes there he tells him he just wants S  k  a  n  k which leads to a great action scene where Brandon Lee just clears house with this awesome song called \\"After The Flesh\\" by The Thrill Kill Kult. He finally get a hold of S  k  an  k & he tosses him out the window The Police chase after him Albercht helps him out. Eric goes to the Grave Yard he finds Sarah there he tells her why he can't stay. He gives her Shelly's Engagement Ring. Sarah is captured so they can lure Eric to The Church Cause Top Dollar Girlfriend-Sister tells him that you have to kill The Crow to to kill the man. So Top Dollar's Right Hand Man & Top Dollar says to Eric \\"Quick impression for you. Caw! Caw! Bang!<br />F  *  *  k I'm DEAD!\\" Draven says he just came here to get Sarah & he will be out of here. Top Dollar shoots him Officer Albercht comes in & he gets in shoot out with Top Dollar & his Right Hand Man he kills his Top Dollar's Right Hand Man. They go after Top Dollar his Girlfriend_ Sister shoots Albercht Eric goes after her she has a hold of The Crow it pecks her eyes out & she falls to her death. Eric goes to the top of The Church & Top Dollar takes full advantage of Eric being weakened. Top Dollar even impales Eric with a sword. Top Dollar admits to being behind what happened to he & Shelly. Eric uses his Telepathy on Top Dollar he gives him 30 hours of pain he falls off the roof & is impaled on a Gargoyle Statue. Eric gets Sarah to safety & makes sure Albercht is ok he goes back to the Graveyard where he reunites with Shelly. Sarah visits Eric & Shelly's Graves 1 more time where The Crow gives her Shelly's Engagement Ring.<br />EXCELLENT MOVIE! Closing this The Crow is an awesome movie I have a lead I care about along with 2 side characters I care about. Villains were entertaining. The look of the film is great the action scenes that were in here were great. The score by Graeme Revell is 1 of his better movie scores & the soundtrack is awesome. Alex Poryas did a really good job directing. Brandon Lee did a great job in his final performance. Michael Wincott did a great job. Ernie Hudson did a very good job. Rochelle Davis wasn't an annoying child actress & she did a good job. If you have never seen The Crow you owe it to yourself to see it. It's a classic. Before I get back to my 20 years ago 2004 in film review series I have a bonus review for Crow City Of Angels.
B0094BB4TW|5|Was so worth it. So nice to be able to check my facebook without having to be on my laptop! I highly recommend it!
B00003CXA2|5|This is the best of Tom's works so far.  Well, I am wrong.  This is one of his best works so far.  Mr. Hanks had grown in to a real actor.
0385501005|4|I enjoyed reading this light romantic comedy about a typical male who can't commit. Having read novels about men who can't commit from a woman's perspective -- Animal Husbandry, Bridget Jones's Diary -- it was nice to read a man's point of view. Duffy is a delightful and sweet hero. Why on earth was he so endearing? Aren't commitment-phobes supposed to be cold-hearted men with no souls? That is exactly why I enjoyed this novel! The hero has great human qualities that make you forget that he's allergic to marriage. I love the part in which he seems as though full possession of the remote control is a main priority in his life. I recommend this cute book from a great male British author!
B003MC5N28|4|I did thoroughly enjoy reading The Giver.  In an age where every story line has been made and remade, especially in regards to dystopian futures, this story is very measured in revealing how much of an impact certain small changes, made over time, can greatly impact our society.
B005S9EKCW|5|This package was just awesome!  I was amazed to have two DVD's in the package.  Regular and Blue Ray.  Thank you.
B0058Z4NR8|5|This subject is not new and many economists and politicians have attempted over the years to finally solve the mystery of why some nations have managed to attain sustainable prosperity for their citizens and others linger in mediocrity or poverty. In my opinion these two guys finally came up with insights that are really hard to ignore or disprove. Their historical and fact-based approach presents convincing arguments to explain the difference in economic and social development achievements of nations some even with common borders or within the same regions. A must read for political leaders in economically struggling nations of what they must work on to pull their countries out of third world under-development and into first world prosperity,.....not an easy thing to achieve but this book is an excellent roadmap.
B00F8MIIKO|5|Cute movie! My 5 & 2 year old sat still for nearly the entire movie which doesn't happen all that often.
0785156593|4|cool book, great writing, good drawings. thanos is a bad dude. this guy will be in the next xmen movie.
B0007YMUZW|5|can it get any better than this?   i dont think it can!  PLEASE pick this CD up TODAY!  also...if you like Ryan Adams you need to pick up something by Jesse Malin...too good!
B001UTW7QU|5|The casting for this tv series was well done.I really like the flow of the plot in this tv series.Whould have given this tv series ten stars.I really love this tv series!
B00BSBR9N6|4|In this era that celebrates geekiness, this book fits well with my enjoyment of the \\"Big Bang Theory\\" and \\"Elementary\\". The book relishes high intelligence, social awkwardness, and love. A great novel for those who have experienced all three.
B001YYQ9SS|5|Wow, the 'Complete' version makes a hell of a lot more sense.  I loved Advent Children because, and I'll admit it, I am a FF7 fanboy.  However, I agree that at some points in the non-complete version of the movie I was like \\"WTF is going on? Oh well it sure does look pretty\\".  The Complete version does a lot to alleviate that feeling for me.  Great film in this 'Complete' version and this is format (Blu-ray) that this movie was meant for in the first place.  It simply looks amazing.
0385349947|5|Bought this as a college graduation gift for my granddaughter. She was pleased to receive this book.  Bought on the reviews and interviews on cable with the author.
B005544TRQ|5|Love the drama mixed with suspense. I can't stop watching what Harvey and Mike will do next, it's a must watch.
B00DXJCGE8|5|Great app and well thought out!  Thanks for the excellent application. I highly recommend this very fine application.  Rick Edwards
B005K0HDGE|5|Love love love this book--many twists and turns--you actually feel like you are living the story along with the characters.  I'm not a huge Stephen King fan by a long stretch, but this book seems very different from his usual horror stories.  It was recommended to me by a coworker who enjoyed reading it--glad I bought it! Excellent
B005UBNKWO|5|I purchased this processor to replace a bad CPU caused by excessive paste being applied and leaking under the processor and onto the pins.  The FX 6100 was an economical replacement that has met and even exceeded my expectations.
B001LPWGE6|5|This price is very high, if you want a better deal buy it off the Amazon.co.uk site for £17.97.  That is about $28-30.  And yes it plays on players sold here in the USA.  Save yourself some money and enjoy these great movies.    -James
0451228731|5|Suarez has done his research. As good science fiction writers will do, Suarez takes current and bleeding edge technology and stretches it into something powerful and somehow frighteningly plausible! The accuracy of the technical aspects of this book along with the vivid imagery and descriptions held my attention from the first chapter to the last. Ready to sink my teeth into the sequel. Great work.
0380973650|3|Man this book had some serious potential with the premise, but it disappointingly fell short.  It is a very confusing text to wander through and at times is ridiculously confusing and I am a pretty intelligent person. It's just that he doesn't develop the plot quick enough and you are having to wait to learn more.  I did read this book rather quickly and I must say that it is an entertaining trip and the ending is rather good, but trying to digest this thing is what takes the majority of ones' time.
B001KVZ6FW|5|What can I say except that this film is exceptional not only in its fine graphics, but in it's original story line.  At first, I must admit, it choked me up a bit.  Yes, I was moved by a cartoon!  I admit defeat and am not ashamed to.<br /><br />The way time progression was handled was brilliant.  To be able to view Carl and his deceased wife as children made us feel even more connected to these characters than we would have if they had left that whole time sequence out of the film.  She was spunky, he was quiet.  They made a sweet couple.  She had dreams that they never fulfilled, or so Carl thought.  What he found out in the end was an invaluable lesson...the joys of an ordinary life were treasured by his wife as an adventure in itself and made me realize that although most of our life is made up of the ordinary things like washing dishes, painting the porch and sorting socks...well, it's all an adventure nonetheless.  Take a chance on this film.  It was well worth the time spent watching it.
B004ZJZQHE|5|Awesome movie
B00BUVPIRS|4|This game is very fun and would be five stars it didn't have a gun it's a medieval fantasy game.
B000SW4DP8|5|I thought the story was wonderful, the acting was terrific, the two young girls were outstanding.  I loved that it was not a typical Hollywood ending.
B00OKYQZDI|4|Cute and fun game. During time when I need something to do it is fun easy and time consuming. Love the colors.
B006VFLIYK|4|The Innocent is a fast read that keeps you flipping the next page to delve deeper into the mysterious murders that on the surface appear to have no connection. Another enjoyable book by Baldacci.
B000XUBFE2|4|Was not impressed in the beginning, but once I got used to the writers style i was totally caught up in the story. Very emotional and sad but left with you  a feeling of hope for the human race. That maybe just one person can make a difference for good instead of evil.
B003PIUBZS|5|Amazon rates top delivery time!  Love this action packed TV series of the portrayal of ancient Roman society.  Great product with wonderful attention to detail and I will treasure this series in memory of Andy Whitfield.  Five Stars All The Way!
B00FLDG5AA|5|I have been buying the Crossroads DVD's since they came out and I always wondered why they never released a CD so that we could put the music in the car and finally it happened.  All of the Festivals are great and you always hear a band that just knocks you out.  Last time it was Gary Clark and this time it is Andy Fairweather Loew's version of &#34;Gin House Blues&#34;.  A great song sung by one of the most underrated singers accompanied by Eric on guitar.
B00UCKXW5I|3|Songs were cut short<br />Disappointing
B000V1Y43W|5|Picture quality of this Blu-ray is virtually identical to the Master the creators worked with according to their opinions at the pre-release showing.
B003UBTX6S|3|Beautiful Darkness took on a more mysterious and adventurous tone than the first book. The amount of boyfriend and girlfriend drama was a bit predictable and bothersome, but that's just my personal thought. Overall it's a decent book.
B00J3AW23G|5|I haven't played all the levels yet but the ones I have done have been enjoyable. Some are very simplistic while others make you do a double take and actually think a little. The graphics aren't spectacular but they are a nice blend of colors that are easy on the eyes. The movement is fluid and there is no lag. When you complete a puzzle and move to the next one the change is very smooth. A major plus in my book is being able to play off line. It seems most developers are requiring a constant Internet connection when it simply isn't necessary. In most cases it's for data mining, licence checking, ads or social networking. The only negative I've found with this game is the constant in your face nag screen about reviewing the game. I understand the desire to have your product reviewed so you can see how your game is seen by the people playing it. Unfortunately there are many immature people out there that will give a poor review out if spite because of this type of nagging. Hopefully they tone down the frequency of the review nag. After every level is simply way too much. Maybe a nice genuine request between each puzzle group. But even with the over nag for a review I felt this game deserved the full 5 stars. I will update if needed as I progress through the levels.
B000002JSP|5|Very few are rock legends.  Led Zepplin managed to achieve this.  If you span their entire career you may find three songs that you wouldn't like.  They are one of the greatest (if not the greatest) rock bands ever assembled.  Pages songwriting abillities are uncanny.  In my opinion they are the most versitile rock band ever.  I don't understand how you can say the guitar work from the earlier albums is better.  Unless you don't know anything about guitar.  The layering on this album is increddible.  \\"All of my love\\" is one of my favorite zepplin songs.  \\"In the evening\\" and \\"Fool in the rain\\" are great.  As well as the ragtime rock of \\"South bound suarez\\" None of the songs are bad at all.  This albums solid.  In my opinion this and \\"presence\\" are page's least sloppy works.  I'm not saying they are the best, But they are still great.
B00000G6NI|5|Hey \\"Music Fan, 1999\\" were we at the same show in 1982?!?!? Veteran's Auditorium in Des Moines, Iowa? Rory came out and with his shear energy and frenzied performance brought the house down!!! The day after the show I could hardly wait to get to a, (yeah, I show my age), record store and find those amazing songs: \\"Shin Kicker\\", \\"Brute Force and Ignorance\\", \\"Cloak and Dagger\\", \\" Mississippi Sheiks\\" and please don't forget, \\"Shadow Play\\". Those songs stuck out like a gold vein in the side of a mountain. Simply some of the greatest rock songs I've EVER heard!!! I bought the album and couldn't wait for the CD. Frankly, I could do without the extra tunes on any of the Rory Gallagher reissues. The extended liner notes are great but you can't improve, on what I believe to be, one of the best collections of guitar rockers committed to disk-whether it be vinyl or plastic!!!    Do yourself a favor and purchase this disk of doozies. I wish this Irish-rocker was still around to blow Rush off the stage again. (Hey, I like old Rush so don't hate me too bad.) Sadly, we lost this wonderful gentleman of Rock `n' Roll back in 1995.

1594630844|5|When I was first introduced to \\"30 Lessons,\\" I thought: \\"Great, another uplifting self-help book filled with the same old tired platitudes.\\" Boy, was I ever wrong! This book is a rare treasure offering a wealth of hard-earned insight and wisdom on the critical, bedrock issues we all struggle with to create a life that is meaningful, loving, and, at the end, absent of regret. I simply cannot overstate it -- if you've ever wished for a clear roadmap for how to live a truly good and satisfying life, well, you've just found it.
1423101464|4|Rick Riordan has done it again. Another brilliantly witty and wonderful book in the Percy Jackson series. Percy is growing up, becoming a young man and his powers are becoming almost more than he can control. I simply cannot wait for the next one!
B0018CMJSU|5|I first saw The Godfather in the theater.  I was only 6 but my dad wanted me to show me a family film...I presume it was his version of a family film. It certainly wasn't my mom's who was angry with him for taking me to a film as violent, yet loving translation of Mario Puzo's masterpiece.  These movies changed my youth.  Although the casting of Sofia Coppola, in the 3rd iteration of the series was ok, Winona Ryder would have been better.  The Coppola Restoration was needed...be sure to watch the 2 extra discs...
0765322889|2|I really wanted to give this series a chance.  After slogging through books 6-10 of Wheel of Time and waiting for A Dance with Dragons to come out, I needed something to get me back into the fantasy swing on a good foot.  This was not the book for that.    Everything about Gardens of the Moon just sort of turned me off.  Whether it was the confusing, jump-all-over-the-place narrative, the absolutely absurd character names, are the obnoxious and insufferable characters themselves, namely Captain Paran, you name it, I hated it.  I know some people will claim that I might not be clever or patient enough to quite \\"get it\\".  Whatever.  There really isn't much there that I would want to get in the first place.    Something I did get was Erickson's blatant attempt to create his own typical super-badass antihero in the form of Anomander Rake.  I will not spoil it for anyone who has the fortune of not having read this book, but let me just say if there is a problem, Mr. Rake can use his all powerful badass powers to fix it.  Seriously, the entire last quarter of the book consists of the author coming up with bigger badies with the sole purpose of getting killed by this guy.  The worst part is that everyone seems to actually like this shallow, cheap character.  Whatever floats your boat I guess.    All in all, Gardens of the Moon is not the worst book I have ever read (that distinction goes to Crossroads of Twilight).  But its pretty damn close.
B0053O8ARI|5|The first 8 episodes are my favorites! I believe they embody the concept of the show better than any of the subsequent episodes. The chemistry between Max & Oleg & Max & Earl is hilarious and I believe the writers need to refocus there.<br /><br />The show is called 2 BROKE Girls so it was very believable that Max had 2 jobs especially since having a small cupcake business wouldn't have made her enough money to quit her 2nd job babysitting in Manhattan and that job could have even helped fund the cupcake business' materials. Peach was a great character to show the contrast between Caroline's outlook on being rich and Peach's outlook on being rich; she was also great to show the contrast between Max's common sense & down-to-earth personality & Peach's complete lack of common sense.<br /><br />Even my husband loves the show! It may have \\"girls\\" in the title & have 2 girls as the main characters, but the type of humor & other characters create a hilarious show that both guys and girls will enjoy. Oleg & Earl are fantastic, inappropriate, & original. Everyone will enjoy their moments in the show.
B00D7Z4GQY|4|Good book for light reading.  Kept my interest.  Good for discussion as in &#34;what would you do&#34;?  I would recommend it.
B009MEEZXI|4|Inspiring movie!
B00GLX1MG6|4|Really pleasantly surprised by this film.  It had quite a few laugh out loud moments and lots of chuckles throughout.  I did not expect it to be as funny as it is.  Make sure to check out the outtakes at the end; the giant Mexican goon outtake is hilarious.
0385504209|4|I was completely unprepared for an exciting Ludlum-like adventure because all the folks that had told me about the book stressed the religious side.  The confused hero and heroine striving to understand the few clues tossed their way are here.  No fewer than two secret or sort-of-secret societies are also included here. The religious angle adds zest to the story but the story in no way depends on it.  We can only hope that the host of evocative little 'facts' (like Friday the 13th being unlucky because a pope tried to irradicate the Knights Templer on one or that 'villain' comes from 'villager') will someday be sorted through and we will be shown which are real and which fabricated - I'll bet most are real.  A note - if you don't take kindly to the Christian church tradition being scrutinized you may want to pass on this one.  Not to worry though about the Christian spiritual tradition, it comes through fine.  The four instead of a five is because of a relatively weak ending - they should have consulted with Ludlum.
B00028HBKM|4|nice item. have had great success with it. love it to the fullest. i would recommend. nice deal and great buy!
B001FB4W0W|5|This series is entertaining and different from other shows out there. It's a bit gory at times, but overall quite fun to watch.
B00MXEPCUY|4|I am an avid player of Gamevil games, this being the third I play daily and although I have some slight annoyances with the game, I would still highly recommend it to anyone that can read.<br /><br />Pros: The graphics are wonderful to look at while playing and the hack-and-slash skills/fighting system are very fun. The cosmetic armies are very appealing and beautifully done. You are allowed to add friends that can help you temporarily at the boss sections of each area on the maps. The community, as far as I have seen, is generally friendly and willing to lend a hand. You can earn &quot;karats&quot; (cash points) in game through various ways. There are a lot of log in bonuses, gm gifts and easy ways to earn items you need. The game, to me, is fun and addicting. Even while it requires stamina to play, friends can send you three stamina each.<br /><br />Cons: The avatar items cost the real money currency called karats (which can be earned in game) but 1. They cost so much that earning one piece could take months and 2. They give actual attack and defense bonuses instead of being purely cosmetic. This is what I call &quot;pay to win&quot; and this is the main reason I gave it four stars. Some of the boss levels are so excessively tough to beat, even when you have help from a friend. I had to get a level 55 player to help on an easy mode end boss in the level 20 area and it still killed me. There are a few lag spikes in the beginning of dungeons and sometimes during using skills.<br /><br />I will update with any more pros and cons as I play the game more. My ign is Nervium if anyone new needs help!
B006MW3UZW|5|Every part of this production is outstanding, sets a mark that can't be even approached by special effect epics and depressingly  gritty 'reality' tales.  Wonderful scripts for every episode, real and touching acting, glorious settings (not set at all), and very moving music, always appropriate and never intrusive.  I've left some things out, I know.  Others can remind us of those.

B000J103PC|5|Pound for pound, no one lays on the vicious snark like a woman targeting another woman. THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA explores a corner of the cutthroat fashion industry, a nerve-wracking environment replete with competitive jealousies and general, all-around meanspiritedness. Into this world steps Anne Hathaway's character, Andrea \\"Andy\\" Sachs, an aspiring journalist eager to get a foot in the door. To gain invaluable experience, Andy interviews for a job as the assistant's assistant to the ridiculously demanding Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), acclaimed head of the trend-setting Runway magazine.<br /><br />Andy is a size six, and this automatically makes her the brunt of mean jokes by those in her new work office. Andy comes from a down-to-earth place and sort of scoffs at her co-workers' unending obsession with haute couture. She promises her boyfriend cook Nate (Adrian Grenier) that she won't change. But of course she does. Andy loses her way.<br /><br />Meryl Streep submits yet another powerhouse performance as the film's dragon lady. Miranda Priestly is the sort of boss who can effortlessly, whimsically shatter an employee's self-esteem. I take in the twitchy reactions of those in her circle and how they tiptoe on eggshells whenever she's in the room, and even I start to sweat. But Meryl Streep is able to sneak in an echo of vulnerability. You may end up sympathizing with her a bit. This actress is just so consistently good.<br /><br />Stanley Tucci himself is masterful in another of his side character roles. I think every movie should have Stanley Tucci in it. Emily Blunt as Miranda Priestly's frazzled first assistant - and Andy's primary foil - is fun to watch, and she makes the most out of her thankless role. When THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA first released in 2006, Anne Hathaway was only then just starting to distance herself from her wholesome teen princess roles. So she was a question mark, going into this film, even with HAVOC and BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN in her rearview. No worries, she confidently steps into this post-Disney role, and she's quite good.<br /><br />Because there's something innately appealing about Hathaway. Even when her character does eventually sell out, you don't hate her. You're not mad-dogging her. You just want her to get back on track. The film easily develops a rooting interest for her. Her immediate boss, the first assistant, is so cruddy in her behavior towards Andy that Andy right away falls into that underdog slot. Except she overcomes that soon enough. Andy, who is brainy enough that she rejected Stanford Law to pursue her journalistic dreams, turns out to be endlessly resourceful in meeting Miranda Priestly's incessant, impossible demands. It's not too long before the first assistant is demoted. Yay for Andy. You could feel her getting more and more sucked into this seductive world. Her long-suffering boyfriend's patience is wearing thin.<br /><br />This film renders me a stranger in a strange land, forced to absorb exotic name brands like Prada, Valentino Garavani, Giorgio Armani, and others I would have to look up on Wiki. I desperately longed for someone to name drop the Gap or Old Navy or Fruit of the Loom, something familiar. Gratifyingly, the story drew me in. The acting fixated me to the screen. I laughed at the right bits and scornfully rolled my eyes at the sheer fanaticism these frantic characters invested in mere articles of clothing. I then went to sleep in my awesome grown-up Underoos.No worries, she confidently steps into this post-Disney role, and she's quite good.<br /><br />Because there's something innately appealing about Hathaway.

B004J1DBJI|5|Excellent!!
B000RFPORM|5|I was about 13 when I stumbled into this movie. I was camping at the beach at the time and my friends and I wanted to go into town and see a movie. We didn't know what was playing and we didn't care. We had no idea what we were in for. I was totally transfixed and amazed. Over the years I took all my friends to see 81/2 . It is unlike any other movie. Fellinni truly takes you into another world and many of the images never leave you, like a surreal and haunting dream that you can't seem to fully awaken from. Truly one of a kind and a masterpiece!
B005ZOBNOI|5|Sweet and tender from the beginning! I have read it twice now and loved it. love can do such amazing things!

0307454541|1|I'm another Constant Reader who just didn't \\"get\\" this book.  I bought it when it was first published in the US, not during the recent hype, and I was encouraged to buy it initially because of its popularity in Sweden.  It sounded like it would be a good read.  I started the book and only made it through a few chapters when I decided that I didn't need to waste my time on something that wasn't enlightening or compelling.  I'm not saying I have to have everything \\"spoon-fed\\" to me; I've read my share of books where I've spent vast sections wading through prose.  Hell, I've read \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" for crying out loud. Talk about wading through prose.  I've had this book a few years and since it's become extremely popular and there are two additional books now, I'm going to give it another try.  Perhaps I'll write a different review in six months.

B00EZPCYQ4|5|This is such a fantastic well-rounded album by a band that is constantly challenging itself to create a new sound while still being true to their art. They don't fall into that musical abyss where every band sounds alike. While the lyrics are often dark in nature, they still provide uptempo beats that are almost anthem like and then transition into slower ominous ballad like sounds. The only people who seem to be disappointed by this band or album are those who listen with preconceived ideas about what they want to hear from the band. I respect the fact that AFI continue to make the music they want rather than what the public or trends demand.
0385532458|3|Slice-of-life stories from the Mississippi. All based in and out of Clanton. No twists. No surprises. Sheer curiosity may entice readers.<br /><br />Most living in the cities may be curious to know what life in the small towns and villages may be like. Beyond what is shown in the news, and beyond what appears in glorified paeans to the rural life. This book provides a matter-of-factly look. That is its strength. Just don't expect twists in the tale.<br /><br />However, some of the stories, in fact all of them, come to think of it, just end. They peter off to an ending. No unexpected twists.<br /><br />The best of the lot has to be the first story, \\"Blood Drive\\", a hilarious travelogue of sorts to Memphis. \\"Michael's Room\\" is the story that you wonder - about what could have been had this story landed in the hands of Stephen King. The most disappointing has to be \\"Casino\\". \\"Fish Files\\" is where Grisham gets close to the familiar territory of lawyers and legal firms, but that too is almost incidental to the plot.<br /><br />You will not get the satisfying endings, albeit at times macabre, that you get with collections such as [[ASIN:0312933525 A Twist in the Tale]], [[ASIN:B00197NEAG No Comebacks]], or the absolutely twisted tales in [[ASIN:0743491599 Twisted: The Collected Stories of Jeffery Deaver]]. The gold standard, of course, has to be Roald Dahl - [[ASIN:0140158073 Collected Short Stories of Roald Dahl]].<br /><br />Ok read.

B00008RH3L|5|Another Coen Brothers movie that surpasses all expectations.  Gabriel Byrne, John Turturro, Albert Finney, Steve Buscemi, and Marcia Gay Harden perform exceptionally.  It is a disturbing and suspenseful drama that flows along effortlessly and catches the viewer up in a way that he is gripping the seat he is sitting on.  This movie brings you into the Coen Brothers' minds and shows you how much immeasurable creativity they have.<br /><br />A definite choice for Coen Brothers' fans as well as for fans of suspense.
B002ECJZ76|4|Now, for something really different, how about a Finnish tale about Santa Claus?  It's an exceptionally sweet story told uniquely with Finish actors and filmed in a tiny Finish town.  You will believe you are there as the life and times of Santa evolve.

B0083ZRAJS|4|Every year during the first weekend of June, residents of the Central New York community of Chittenango, NY hold a three day Oz festival - now called Oz-Stravaganza! - to pay their respects to L. Frank Baum and to celebrate his classic tale, `The Wizard of Oz.' Is there a better way to pay your own respects to one of the greatest American fairy tales of all time than by reading the book?<br /><br />Baum was born in Chittenango, so it is natural for the community to claim him as a native son.  A portion of Genesee Street in Chittenango contains a replica of yellow brick.  The section used to be a real yellow brick road, but the winters of Central New York made upkeep too much of a headache.  The highlight of the Oz Fest is the parade on Saturday afternoon, where you can get your fill of lions and tigers and bears, oh my!<br /><br />Hollywood has as much to do with the legacy of the story as Baum, because people remember the songs from the 1939 movie better than they remember the novel.  \\"We're off to see the wizard, the wonderful Wizard of Oz.\\"<br /><br />You should certainly see the movie, but that does not obviate reading the book.  The book gives the reader a better appreciation for a theme of the novel:  There's no place like home.  The Great American Prairie was a dreary place in the decade before the novel was published, whether it was in South Dakota where Baum lived for a while, or in Kansas, where the novel takes place.  Yet Baum found a way to deliver such a message without alienating its residents by having Dorothy insist that there was no place like home, even as Baum contrasted the lush surroundings of the land of the Munchkins with the dullness and grayness of Kansas.<br /><br />Winged Monkeys, Golden Caps, Wicked Witches, hammerheads, and a Tin Woodman are either important characters or powerful artifacts in the story.  Most of the dialogue comes from talking lions, scarecrows, mice and storks. This is a fantasy story where it is best to let things be,rather than question their veracity.  A strong dose of incense from those poppy fields might be just what the reader needs to get in the proper mood for this story.<br /><br />The central characters are Dorothy from Kansas, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and the Cowardly Lion.  Dorothy is followed by her faithful companion, Toto, who is one of the few animals that do not talk in the novel. All four are on a quest for something that they ultimately have within themselves.<br /><br />The novel is in the public domain, so you can download it for free at Project Gutenberg.  It is also available for free at the Toshiba Book Place, so you can test out their product if you are so inclined.  It is free here too.  The novel was written for children, so the adult reader might find some of the broad strokes painted by Baum simplistic.  Yet the novel, which moves quickly and ends suddenly, contains some profound themes that make it worthwhile to read.  It is one of the great American fairy-tales of all time.
B00003CXXI|5|This movie is one of the better movies that has come out of Hollywood lately. The first time I saw it was with my five year old son. He insisted we see it again and again...we saw it in the theatre FIVE TIMES! Everytime you see this movie, something new and different will hit--like the square flower arrangements in Farquaad's mansion, or the realistic leaves blowing in the &quot;wind&quot;. This movie is appropriate for most age levels and almost all humor levels. It's amazing.
B006GG1KOC|3|Another app. Rating says it all!!
B00EY7LT9Q|4|The show isn't stellar, but it does an okay job tying certain aspects of the Marvel films together. It's also has some okay action, and typical television based drama with compelling characters and interesting back stories.
B00EL8I8IS|2|entertaining !
0786191465|5|I was assigned to read this book for a class called Psychology: Intro to Counseling, Theory and Practice. The book talks about Frankl and his meaning for his life, how and what he found meaning in while in the concentration camps. It is an existentialist writing about his experiences. He grew, he learned, he made choices, and lived life for himself, even under the guise of imprisonment. The fact that any one man can find meaning in all of this is amazing. I really wish I had the chance to meet Krankl and speak with him. It is a powerful story and a great theory. Logotherapy is worth of even the most devoted Freud Fan.
B000AJJNPY|5|When you encounter a rock quartet from Iceland with a guitarist who plays more with a cello bow than a pick or fingers, unique would be the first word to come to mind. When I try to categorize Sigur Ros in relation to something else, the closest I can come to successfully comparing is \\"Radiohead on Acid.\\" Even that still isn't a just comparison.<br /><br />Takk... is an amazing album. The songs just unfold. The music builds and swells to breathtaking climaxes. The music is unbelievably dynamic. The vocals are downright angelic. The texture is thick and rich. The album is produced in a manner that creates an unbelievable experience for the listener. The sounds come together to create a sort of sonic nirvana that can be found in almost no other music. The string arrangements are uplifting to the soul. There is honestly nothing on this album that I would change. Everything fits together perfectly to provide the listener with everything that they want. The music is so interesting that unlike most outfits of popular music, the listener doesn't have to turn to the text of the lyrics in order to maintain interest. Which is important, because unless you know Icelandic, the lyrics have little to offer you. The sounds simply just wash over the listener. I honestly cannot do a just description of this album. You'll have to take my for it that this album will simply give you an experience of pure elation that you have never felt before.
B00DONF9SS|4|I am slowly collecting all of these. They aren't as &#34;nice&#34; as I expected, and a little hard to pose. The joints don't bend as well as you think they would. But the extra faces, hands and accessories are very cute and fun.

B000002H33|5|To be the greatest metal band ever, it would only make sense to hold the title as having made the greatest metal album ever, right? Exactly! This is Metallica's Magnum Opus.

B00164GDD2|1|Ok, you know the movie, great, but this is a Blu Ray Review....terrible, I gave my copy away because it was so awful. Pale picture in one scene, red and yellow and even green skin tones in another. This was just a terrible release by Sony, skip this version and get the 4K version, the only draw back to that is there are no special features which defeats the purpose of a blu ray because they are suppose to be loaded with special features.

The latter -- while not directly causing loss of life -- generates its own form of havoc, by disabling or destroying electronic systems, thereby cutting off vital lines of communication.<br /><br />Actually a monograph, the book’s perspective is global, extending indeed into outer space. The author, Jackson Maogoto, a senior lecturer at the University of Manchester, undertook much of his research during his sabbatical with the British Institute for International and Comparative Law (BIICL).  ‘Without wishing to appear melodramatic,’ he says, ‘the prospect of a celestial war can no longer be regarded as mere fantasy.’  His extensive research amply supports this alarming prognostication.<br /><br />He mentions -- to quote just one example -- the 2001 Commission chaired by the  then US Secretary of State which called for governmental investment in developing ‘superior space capabilities’, concluding that space warfare is, or will be, ‘a virtual certainty’.  For further discussion on this subject, check out Chapter 3 entitled ‘The Fourth Domain: ascendance of outer space as a war theatre’.<br /><br />What is referred to as the fifth domain is explained in the chapter on cyber-war and expanded upon in the final chapter on ‘Old legal frameworks for new threats.’ Technology has advanced, observes the author, but ‘the legal framework has failed to adapt, rendering states unable to legally defend themselves effectively.’  Now there’s an argument that lamentably, seems unarguable -- which gives rise to a discussion of another key issue: self-defence and the right of states to respond.  Here, the role of the United Nations in international conflict of whatever kind, (past, present and future) is considered throughout.<br /><br />Academics and students, as well as comparative lawyers will welcome this author’s thorough approach to a quite thorny, and certainly topical, subject – and with a bibliography of no less than nineteen pages, plus useful tables of cases and statutes, the book is an excellent research resource.<br /><br />The publication date is cited as at 2015.here’s an argument that lamentably, seems unarguable -- which gives rise to a discussion of another key issue: self-defence and the right of states to respond.

There is good suspense the book is very funny.  I found myself  laughing with the main character, John Corey, at his comments on other  characters in the story.  The story is very formulaic but there are couple  twists that keep it interesting.  It was very obvious to me early one what  was being smuggled off the island but it was done pretty well.
B000JIHP88|1|I purchased the same mobile, again, thinking I initially got a lemon. Well turns out the second mobile is flawed too. The music and lights work but the leaves stopped spinning after 1week. I made a complaint to fisher price and they said it would be forwarded to their q&a department. I'm disappointed because I had high hopes for this product based on earlier reviews. I'm now going with another brand and you should consider other options too.
B002VL4OC6|5|Overall, this is one of my most favorite drawing books from my shelf.  It includes a good number of drawings that can also be seen in \\"Drawing from Life\\", but it misses the part that talks about drapery, for instance.  This book is rather small and so can easily be taken with you in your backpack alongside with your sketchbook.  In this book Bridgman covers all the essentials to figure drawing. It has a large chapter on different ways to draw hands, which I enjoy the most. Bridgman shows off more simple and constructed ways to draw the body (hands and legs in a very self explanatory and dynamic way) as well as more advanced techniques.  I would personally say that this book has the potential to fit advanced artists as well as beginners since I have seen hardly any book that breaks down the basics better than this publication. (Hogarth is also very good, but different from Bridgman, so I would recommend to the beginner to practice with both and then pick the artist he feels he can relate to the most style wise.)  What more is to say about this book is that readers that don't understand latin may feel a little lost with the descriptions of the muscles here, which is a little sad when you want to learn how all of the parts of the body are working together in depth.

B0000669JL|5|In trying to rebuild our vast collection of music after our house fire Dec 2012, my husband and I have purchased quite a number of cd's and DVDs through amazon. When I found Bob Marley was available I hopped right on board. Cd arrived in timely manner, well packaged and plays beautifully. If you like reggae, this is the cd to have. Recommend seller as well.

B00004S35Z|5|I used to listen to Stevie Wonder in the early 1970's when I was a preteen. Needless to say this is quite a blast from the past :)<br />Listening now, as an adult, I realize how beautifully simplistic the arrangements are.<br />A *must have * for the Stevie lover. And the price was superb! Hope this helps :)
B00L9B7IKE|4|Took a bit to get into but got very interesting.  Worth a read.
B0067R0APK|1|I've always had problems with this app. Even with my last phone. The main thing, is that the map never loads. Get the free app, it works flawlessly!!
B007XKEY6Q|5|This game is amazing and I love it long time.  It's fun enough without a stylus, but having a stylus and the kindle screen makes the drawing feel much more real.
B00452VF4O|5|Narrating the life and love of Simon de Montfort, this second part of the Welsh Prince trilogy truelly moved me to tears. Its the best one of the three, it's a well balanced story: historically acurate and beautifully told.
B00B1DC2FQ|5|Great piece, nice detail
B00ENIR864|5|I can't believe how easy this is.  Just hover over the block, and voila!, up comes the appropriate website.  My smartphone is truly smarter than me.
B00JVZ0DQG|5|Really enjoy this one!
B0053Q9DHW|4|There is just something about British themed movies that I love. This was no exception. I have never read the story so I viewed this with no expectations and with fresh eyes. I thought the acting was good. The plot was complex and I hurt for the hero and heroine. I did love the ending. Now I want to read the book. Oh, and there were several places where I just about jumped out of my chair when stuff happened in that house. The love story was good and even though the end was sad, it was satisfying.
B005IU1OMA|5|Amazing movie. the soundtrack and snowboarding pair perfectly together. I have watched it many times and still enjoy watching them shred the mountains!! gets me pumped for snowboarding.
