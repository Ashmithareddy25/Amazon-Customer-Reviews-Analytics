1457514508|4.0|I really enjoyed this tongue-in-cheek mystery. The characters were quirky and interesting and there were enough plot twists and surprises to keep me engaged. I kept trying to guess where the book was going, but the author threw in enough red herrings to keep me off balance. The ending pulled everything together and was satisfying. My only complaint is that the publisher did the author a bit of a disservice with the editing. There are quite a few typos! Other than that......no complaints. This was a fun read.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|Though it Is a little small because I play it on my 7\\" HD KindleFire, it is great to play with someone else.  Each player uses one finger.  I would not recommend it for anything smaller than a 7\\" tablet.
006074748X|5.0|It's been years since I read this and I still remember how much I enjoyed it. I recommended it to a friend the other day and I think it's time I reread myself. I hope it's on Kindle. Enjoy!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I've read this series ten times and still love them<br />By the end of the series this is the ideal marriage and redefines being a submissive wife
B00B99KJR0|4.0|this game is hard to put down. i like that you can learn some interesting facts about other places. it would be better if they changed up the screens a little more. it can get repetitious.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I love this movie.  I enjoy it very much.  It is true to the story and explains it very well.  I saw Hugh Jackman in a whole new way.  You will love it.  (But not a children's movie).
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My Aunt got me this book for my birthday and I loved it!  There's something about this book that keeps you coming back for more.  However, I think that you should be at lest twelve to read this book because there are some scenes that may be a bit too much for younger kids.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I think this movie should have been titled &#34;The Slavery Issue.&#34; Because it was titled &#34;Lincoln&#34; I was expecting more story on the life of Lincoln. I think it also exposed the director about his views. In the beginning, The scene where the two black soldiers have a conversation with him is too unbelievable for me. The one soldier seems to go a little too far to the belligerent side. Although it could happen, I doubt it. Of course, the two white soldiers are no where near the level of discourse the other two black soldiers are. What does this show? The black soldiers are more intelligent, therefore setting the movie up for success? In the movie, Lincoln's whole role is in freeing the slaves and getting the Constitutional Amendment passed. Maybe. What meaning does Spielberg want us to see when he titles his movie &#34;Lincoln,&#34; yet it is finger-pluck of his period in the White House - albeit a gut-wrenching period. On the movie itself, it goes an even keel for quite sometime. It is a drama, after all. There is a good deal of showcasing politics. And it leaves you feeling, &#34;no wonder nothing gets done.&#34; After watching both movies, I do see why &#34;Argo&#34; was voted best picture. &#34;Argo&#34; did not make you feel you were going into the movie for one thing, and being disappointed that it was another. One thing I would like to say is this - I think Daniel Day-Lewis portrayed A. LIncoln superbly. On top of that, his acting was awesome. Why he didn't get Best Actor Award is beyond me. He is a marvelous actor and seems to also put forth the best effort. So I will say this: if you want to know how the slavery issue was ended in America, go see this movie. However, if you want to see a biography of Abraham Lincoln, go to TCM and wait for one of the older Lincoln films to come out or wait...for yet another movie on Lincoln to be made.
0399160450|4.0|Tom Clancy continues to give his audience an exciting story as well as a learning experience.  The depth of knowledge gained from this book about cyber warfare increases the reader’s awareness of potential dangers existing in our world today.  Excellent reading and highly recommended.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|The quality if an individual should be measured by their works and not their title/status.  This movie does a pretty good job at portraying this point.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Reacher finds trouble yet again. Another typical Reacher story - completely unbeliveable - but great!  Hope this guy is really out there somewhere righting the world's wrongs.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm overwhelmed by the emotions evoked by this last book of the series. Truly an awesome story. I see that some reviewers are disappointed that Katniss wasn't as strong as they would have liked but she'd have to be a robot or superhuman to endure all that she had and come through unchanged.  I think, more often than not, people stumble or are pulled into greatness rather than diving head first for purely altruistic reasons. It made me appreciate her character even more.
B000000WFZ|5.0|A very moving movie and the music is awesome.  And I can't think of any other words and am curious as to why it has to be a specific number?
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Movie definitely had a lot of action.  Love the music and cinematography.  It definitely has a lot of visual blood spilling--not for the faint of heart.  Characters are all well played.  Jamie Foxx does a wonderful job.
B00AB2NYNC|5.0|This band is the best out there.  I love their rhythm and music.  I would love to see them in person.
B0076DELIG|4.0|This doesn't disappoint as your figure out the perpetrator along with Harry. Lots of good suspense and nice scenes (although not quite realistic) between Harry and his daughter
0525952926|5.0|Both my husband and I read the first and now the second book and we both loved them for different reasons.  I learned more about how the Nazis managed to &#34;take over&#34; a nation of intelligent people, plus the personal stories were very engaging.  I knew very little about the Russian struggle within and found that also very interesting.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|it's definitely McWan, with lots of plot twists that I can't divulge or even hint at.  It covers a period in history that interests me, the cold war, and the fight for hearts and minds between Communist bloc and the West.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|We are Hobbit and Lord Of The Rings fans, and have read all of the books. We have added this fantastic DVD to our collection. The story is a wonderful tale of fantasy, courage, friendship and adventure. We saw this first when the movie came out, and it was a must-have for our video library. Excellent!
B000I186FW|5.0|Love the movie and it's characters, the message it sends and the way it is portrayed! Super movie! Would like to see more like it!
B00006JSS8|5.0|I simply have adored this man's music for decades. His music is great and he is so talented. Thanks for all the years of great music Stevie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I had been hearing so much about this show, I had to check it our for myself. I am Team Daryl all the way. He is AWESOME!!!
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Well written and a must-read for both men and women.  I wish I had read a book like this 30 years ago. It might have given me that little bit of extra confidence to &#34;lean in&#34; in situations where I found myself staying silent and doing what was expected of me.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|Love this show!  These folks are a trip! Back stabbing, but come together when things get rough. Who is my favorite....Chuck Bass of course.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Such a great cast and the performances are hilarious, very well done. I'm a sucker for singing and dancing and this movie showcases such great talent. I give it 5 stars I think it's one of the best comedies I've seen in a long time. Skylar Astin is amazing I can't keep my eyes off him. He played this character perfectly.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love this book shows how kids can be brave and that they can make a change and be a difference in the world
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|Reacher is his usual wry self.  Entertaining read and enjoyable to the end.  Looking forward to the next in this series.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It was very engaging. There is no skip puzzle option and I use that often when I don't feel like working the puzzle. It was ok though. Yes, I used the clues and they were cryptic enough so I didn't feel like I was being handed the answer. I totally enjoyed it. More Rooms, please!
B00BF11STU|4.0|Well done.  Moves a little slow in the beginning as the efforts are all directed at following a cold trail.  Once the circumstantial evidence defines the target, the movie become riveting.
B009IF82SK|5.0|Classic TV sitcom and humor.<br /><br />Don't think any episode is a dud, and some had me in stitches.<br /><br />check it out
B003G4W49C|5.0|What else can be said about Ender's Game? It's one of the best science fiction books ever written and it is truly a wonderful story to read. It will really make you think until the very last page as to the motives of some of the characters.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|My six year old loves it.  Unfortunately the levels get a bit too hard for him rather quickly.  I have played it quite a bit and find it fun for about 15-20 minutes.  Then it gets a bit old.  Still fun though, just not in large doses for me.  I still play it this long after it was the FAOTD.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's free and I love it. It is nothing but a simple calculator. No adds and works great. I use it for math homework most every day. Yes I am a real person.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Grabbed this as a FAOTD and am glad that I did.  It is a great puzzle game that always draws me back in to beat my high score or fastest time.  Simple, yet entertaining.  Worthy of all of its high ratings.
B00B1E6FF8|3.0|To borrow the title from another reviewer, \\"The movie was a little slow and took too long to develop.\\" I really wanted to love this movie. It has the elements that I thoroughly enjoy, based on an actual events, seeing how the CIA operatives go about their jobs and how the military moves forward on actionable intelligence. But this movie just never really pulled me in. For me, great movies and those that pull me in. They make me feel like I know and care about the characters. I become invested in their lives and in the situations in which they are involved. For some reason I felt like I was watching this movie from a distance and that the characters were not developed fully. I think the director could have done a much better job with such a compelling story to work with.<br /><br />I wish that I would have rented this movie instead of buying it.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|Great movie!  Long, but hard to stop watching this wonderful story.  Robert Duvall & Tommy Lee Jones did a great job!
0061950726|4.0|This book wasn't bad, and I'm glad I read it. However, the parallel plotline was distracting for me - I really wanted to know more about the orphan trains/orphans themselves and the history behind them, and not typical teen angst. The second plot line seemed forced and not entirely authentic, and so it made the whole story not nearly as believable (even as a fictional tale - the way the teens talked seemed like the way older adults think they talk, and not how they ACTUALLY talk to each other). Overall, it is a good, easy read...not the best book I've read, but not the worst. Worth it for the price.
B00A4AI17A|3.0|From all the other reviews, you can quickly get a sense of how well performed these works are, and the technical quality of the discs is quite good.  I'm just bummed at the cheap, poorly executed packaging of this set.  The bottom half of the set is typical of many boxed sets of this type.  The top half is a flimsy light weight slip cover.  Although wrapped in clear plastic, this slip cover did not arrive in good condition.  I do not blame the shipper...I blame whoever chose to design this with no lid and only a poor slip cover to actually hold the discs in the lower half box.  I'd throw the slip cover away, except that would only leave a generic bottom half of a shoe box to hold the set.  EMI needs to rethink this &#34;design&#34; and make it decent for the real world.  Had I known about this issue, I could have purchased a different Label's Verdi box.  Love the music, hate the look/function of the packaging.
B0044RUSZM|5.0|I have been looking for a stand to lift my laptop and give me some room underneath for storage and this is it! Feels very sturdy under my computer and it brings it to the perfect height so I am not hunched over at my desk while I work.
B009AMANH4|5.0|What a movie!  I already saw it on the big screen, but seeing it again made Lincoln and the events leading to his assassination even more real.  Congratulations to Stephen Spielberg for his concept, Daniel Day-Lewis for his lead acting performance, and Sally Field, Tommy Lee Jones, Hal Holbrook, et al, for their superior support.  An absolute must-see for all Americans!!!!!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was worth the long wait. Hopefully it won't be another 5 years to wait for book 6.<br /><br />The story is still just as good as when I first started so long ago. The characters are still just as interesting & flawed as they were when the story began. The new characters introduced add much to the overall story.<br /><br />If you haven't been reading this story, what are you waiting on.
B001LM1456|3.0|It's OK - Much better than the other Hulk movies.<br /><br />(why is there a min. word requirement for the reviews??)
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Believe the hype. BELIEVE. If Shakespeare was alive, he'd be watching this with a big bowl of popcorn right now.
B008Y1RTUG|1.0|First of all, I apologize for all my future dangling sentences...I am not a good writer and English is not my first or second language..  Here are some of the things I have to say about this movie.<br />1.  It felt like someone with a desire to make a great movie found lots of money and made this movie without having an expert in screen writing, editing, or story telling..<br />2.  Kristen whatcmacallher..  she really needs to take some acting classes..  I felt like I was watching a Keanu Reeves in Kristen Stewart's body..She sucked at every move she made and every word she uttered..<br />3.  Why try to invent a wheel when it is already invented?  Snow white is already a story... from beginning to end..why not use the original story?<br /><br />Now, let me elaborate on each item.  1.  Why did it feel like someone with a desire to make a great movie found lots of money and made this movie without having an expert help in screen writing, editing, or story telling.. Because, I strongly believe that there isn't a person in this world who doesn't know the story of Snow White..  Ok, maybe there is, but probably 100% of people of the western world knows this story..In Snow White there is a part when she goes to 6 dwarfs house and falls a sleep and that's how the first meeting happens.  In this movie, the dwarfs are portrayed as bunch of loser, punk, low life bandits..Why? what purpose does that portrayal serve?  I don't get it...In order for dwarfs to have loyalty towards her, there has to be the time when she cooks, cleans and makes delicious food to win their hearts..  This is a vital process in the story, why kill it?  And if you kill it, what do you place it with?  The answer is nothing...  this is when story teller could help the movie maker, or  editor..or whoever does this job..  The special effects in the movie was great.. but the story lacked substance..  then the Huntsman...  when did he have time to fall in love with Snow White?  What did I miss?  And Snow White's childhood friend.. I thought he was in love with her...Even in this movie it was  portrayed like that..when the Witch shifts her shape and approaches her as her lover... and gives her an apple...Why do that? Why make her kiss him then pull back?  No love relationship was built between Snow White and the Huntsman...  so I kept thinking that maybe the video skipped sessions and I ended up rewinding to make sure that I didn't miss anything...<br /><br />This could have been one of the best modernized story of Snow White with a chance of becoming a classic!  Except, it became a poorly written story with tons of money wasted... I am really disappointed..Now number 2.<br />2.  Kristen Stewart...  yes, she could win an Oscar in Actress who sucked at acting.  After 2 hours of watching her sucky acting, the movie ends with her becoming a Queen who has nothing to say to her people...nothing none whatsoever..all she has is unidentified facial expressions...  For Pete's Sake, why didn't they make her say something so simple as \\" My people today is the day of Victory and we shall all celebrate!  DJ drop the beat!\\"  OMG, not even a word...  This must be the time when the director of the movie finally realizes that she sucks at acting and gets pissed of with himself and punishes himself to the point where his mind goes blank and ends the movie with weird facial expressions done by Kristen Stewart...  This is the first part of what I had to say about her..  Second is, out of all those beautiful fair skinned actesses why chose Kristen as Snow White?  WHY???  She is not pretty...  WHYYYYY?  I would have loved to see Nelly Furtado play that role... or Mila Kunis, though if I had this much money I would have Adriana Lima play this role... just have to whiten her skin a tad bit... but never ever Kristen Stewart..she doesn't have the right facial features to play the role...<br />Third of all, when did she train herself to become a warrior?  Locked up in her room in the castle?  C'monpeople can't you figure out this much that the audience need to know when and how she train herself to lead the army to war...<br /><br />This movie reminds me of my early years in cooking when I had a perfect recipe in front of me, I would use different ingredients and the food I made tasted nothing like what it was supposed to taste like. If a recipe calls for sauteed onions do not replace it with sauteed garlic...  it's a different taste...I hope you all got my point...and it is my mistake buying the movie without reading the reviews....
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Everyone needs a calculator,but I simply love this one. I like that it keeps history of the calculations you use. And then you can simply go back to them if you forget an answer.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i love it can read my bible on the go.helps me to get get renewed even if im sitting at the doctors office
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. I think it is great for my granddaughter who loves horses. I really think she would have fun. I know I am having fun. A wonderful game for all ages. Wonderful graphics.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This is a movie I want to watch over and over again. It's fresh and interesting with very likable characters.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|when you fist load up the game take away the Obed pop ups plz then I would definitely buy it for $2
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use. Easy to read. I use this calculator often. Works like a charm. This is a must have.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|SKYFALL, the question is where is the real James Bond. In the past we would go to see a Bond movie to watch a debonair, good looking guy get the girls with a flick of his finger, we would see him battle 500 of Spector's men and not mess up his hair. We couldn't wait for Q's new gadgets, everything was over the top, that was the essence of Bond.<br /><br />We knew the man wasn't real, we knew the story was unbelievable, and we loved to see gadgets being used.  The women, the settings of the story and the fact that James Bond was invincible, these were the reasons we went to see a Bond movie.<br /><br />SKYFALL is a good movie exciting and action packed but the fun is gone, it's as if Sid, James's brother leaves his job in the coal mines and pretends to be James while James is away on some island with a beautiful woman hiding for a few months from M.<br /><br />Change a few names of the characters and this movie could be a Sid Bond thriller. I would have gone to see it and refered others to it. Being good is not enough though IT'S NOT A JAMES BOND MOVIE its ordinary.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abbey is truly an outstanding production - acting, screenplay, camera work, settings, costumes, everything.  I especially like the way that the diverse characters play off of each other.
B001VLXNO2|3.0|V kery interesting story line.  Mountain climbing details and stats were tedious at times.  Wonderful humor woven throughout the book.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love diamond dash not  just because I am good at it but because you can also verse your friends on fb
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob:  A Novel is crafted in an unfamiliar format, but easy to catch on to.  The angst of a loving father, inattentive to details of his son's life and behaviors is haunting; because we all fear that we could be a parent that misses something major in our child's behavior and things go amok.  I had to finish it.  Won't tell you the ending.  The man's internal turmoil is presented at times in such a linear set of facts, you wonder if he can wake up to reality.  Suspense is well written.  For the tender of heart or wounded it would be hard read.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|this is where it started for Sara and I. Her voice and lyrics are so poignant.<br /><br />I'm excited for her new album- and really anything she puts out.<br />I highly recommend this album and everything she's ever done.
0812452240|3.0|This edition was a small sized paperback book, with very tiny and compact print.  It was very difficult to read, and since it's a long and complicated story I felt that it would be very difficult to enjoy.  I returned it in exchange for a hard cover, full sized edition which is much easier to read.
B007VPLNGW|3.0|Picked out by a six year old, and she was interested....for awhile. After the first day, she had already gone back to her favorite games.
B004WOS3P4|5.0|Great album.  Fantastic performances.  Beautiful lyrics.  Creative music.  This one was worth waiting for.  I'm glad I own this one!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game was amazing. On survival mode you start out with no resources and you have to make stuff like houses,crafting tables, and stuff to survive. On creative mode you can let your imagination run wild<br />You can build skyscrapers, portals,hotels,churches, and Atlantis.(only if<br />you believe in it)On survival mode there are zombies,skeletons,creeper,<br />and spiders. On creative mode there are no zombies, skeletons, creeper,and spiders. I say that this game is great. Do not listen to other reviews!<br />Other reviews say no of course this is a 5 star game you should buy.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I Loved that it was written through the eyes of the dog and in the end we meet Enzo again.
0374214913|4.0|I liked this book, although I felt it was a bit disjointed and the story did not flow as well as it might have.  But none the less it was enjoyable and since I live close to San Francisco I was pleased with the Bay Area setting and the Silicon Valley stuff was fun.  It is definitely a book for those who enjoy off-kilter, science/nerdy kind of stuff, and not for those who like their stories pretty straight arrow.  If you like Murakami you will see his influence. I plan to read more of Robin Sloan's work.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|loved this movie...cant wait to watch it again, and again, you will not be disappointed...one of my all time favorites...will cry your eyes out
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very addictive. I LOVE THIS GAME. I can't stop playing it just like the real carnival games. I have already beat it once and started all over again.
B00BQQM262|4.0|The movie is enjoyed by my family. The underlying theme of learning to be less selfish is always a good watch.<br /><br />I wasn't impressed with the HD version of this movie. Don't bother spending the extra for it.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|First, after viewing Seasons 1 and 2, had to see what happens next. This series is very well written ~ much attention to details non of most of us has experienced in our time. Superb acting. The British are way ahead of us providing quality television. Our offerings leave much to be desired!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait to finish the series!  This book was as good as the last. I recommend this whole series to anyone who wants to enjoy a great read!
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I needed an app that would let me watch youtube vids offline.  This guy does the job.  Also, porn ads.  Watch out for that.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|no issues with the product. prompt delivery, watched several episodes with my child. would make the purchase again and currently have season two in my wish list.
B00004Y87O|4.0|Escape from NY came out in 81. It completely captures the feeling we had of what the future would be like; dark, depressing, everything broken. Remember we'd just survived (barely) four years of Jimmy Carter. Crime was pretty bad. Oil prices were high. Regan's morning had yet to dawn. The notion of a future (1997) where NY would be a prison with no guards was both intriguing and in some weird way - cool. Add to that Snake Plissssken, Lee Van Cleef and twenty-four hours (or whatever it was) to get the president out before he died was great escapist entertainment.<br /><br />David Feeney, Author [[ASIN:B00CWRQAJY Terror On The High Seas]]
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Fast delivery, good solid fit. useful product. protects the kindle and seems to be well made. my son is completely happy with the purchase.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed this book club selection. Makes you wonder about genetics and inherited behavior and parent responsibilities for their children. Are some people really &#34;born that way&#34;?
0307341577|5.0|Dark Places is one of those books that you just can't put down. It's very well written and it's very twisted,something like a horror movie in a book. I was surprised and shocked at times but isn't that what a good book is about? I loved it. I loved all three of Gillian's books and I can't wait for the next one.
B007SGM084|5.0|This was a great book.... I think it is more for the younger generation. You have to have an open mind in order to like the book. It was very well written.
1451695187|5.0|A fascinating and understandably controversial work.  The fact that the author is a scientist and was not particularly religious before his (alleged) near-death experience makes the work all the more compelling.  Skeptical readers may or may not be convinced that Dr. Alexander's visions were &#34;real&#34; (whatever that word means), but they will be unable to come up with an alternate explanation.  Human consciousness remains a mystery, and I believe that open-minded, thoughtful readers will be intrigued with this book.
B009K916ZK|5.0|By &#34;party,&#34; I mean conference. Most conferences that I attend provide a cable to connect a PC to the projector, but not a Mac, so if you have this cable, you will be extremely popular with all of the people that didn't realize that Macs come with a bring-your-own-connectors requirement at most places. This little device has improved my self-esteem by leaps and bounds since I bought it a few months ago. For a double self-esteem boost, get the iPad/iPhone VGA connector. You'll be surrounded by adoring fans (aka desperate presenters without the necessary adapters).
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This was a different book with a new perspective that I enjoyed.  I hadn't read anything else like this before.
1449410243|5.0|I usually don't review books, because it's subjective and I don't feel like my review would contribute anything helpful. However, this book contains key clues that let you know if your cat is out to get you, and is essential for all cat owners. Because of this book, I have learned that one of my cats is definitely plotting to kill me, and am currently taking action to avoid an untimely demise.
B00112GVFO|5.0|Good to see that the franchise continues!  Writer top notch, movie version seems true to the plot.  Good entertainment, with a potentiial for historical values.!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this app is awesome!!! It lets your imagination run wild. I think though  that it would be better with guns but.still awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan is a fantastic writer! He is engaging and a true master of telling a story.  My students are in love with his books!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I loved how the author wove into this book some thought provoking issues around child abuse, and our religious systems guilty of such. I loved the real ness of the main characters, and then the final resolve! Great book!
B002ZG98J6|2.0|The books were amazing.  The story was great...in the book.  Hollywood took what was an engaging story and watered it down to the point of near non-existence.  It's a shame really...all the people that will not read the books because the movie was so awful....<br /><br />Read the book! Don't make a judgement off of the movie!
B00B7FWWNA|4.0|The acting by all concerned is of a very high standard. It is difficult to make a film of the subject matter, but the director succeeded in keeping me glued to the screen.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Rick Riordan is a fantastic writer! He is engaging and a true master of telling a story.  My students are in love with his books!
B002MCJZHS|4.0|I like this album. It is very chilled and easy to listen to. Unique sound, although my wife can't stand the way the singer &#34;eases into the notes&#34;.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Rick Riordan is a fantastic writer! He is engaging and a true master of telling a story.  My students are in love with his books!
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Django Unchained is a fantastic piece of entertainment. While it may not offer the social commentary that many thought it should deliver, it is a wild ride and fun throughout. Quentin Tarantino's direction seems entirely purposeful & focused. He has flashed elements of &#34;Spaghetti Western&#34; themes in other films, but it all comes together in Django. This may be his best film to date.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx is fantastic as Django. Quiet and flashy all at once, Foxx plays it with a subtlety I haven't seen out of him yet. Leonardo DiCaprio is great as a slimy plantation owner. Christoph Waltz steals the movie with his performance as Dr. King Schultz. Waltz is charming, hilarious, compassionate and quick with a gun. His performance was truly deserving of the Oscar.<br /><br />Django Unchained flies by at 2 hours 45 minutes. You won't want to blink. Great music through-out. Tarantino's use of music from other time periods hasn't always worked for me, but in Django it only serves to update the genre for a new generation.

B000001F7R|4.0|Before Def Lep became pop, they were 70's metal.  Steve Clark is my guitar hero, and hearing him clearly on this early record reminds me of why I liked Def Leppard to begin with.
B0028AQLYE|2.0|The dry top works well for keeping out water but the restricted air feeling was bothersome and about the same as their cardio cap. You can just use it as a cardio cap. I find the Finis snorkle hard to purge even with its purge valve so I ordered this but the air restriction was too much for my purposes. My old scuba diving snorkel works best, the one on the side, for purging.
B005AUWY90|5.0|Very enjoyable spy movie that focuses more on Mater than Lightening McQueen.  It really demonstrates the value of friendship, and we found it very enjoyable.
0316056863|5.0|I love Tina Fey's sense of humor so I enjoyed reading Bossy Pants.  I purchased the book used, but it looked brand new!  Received shipment promptly; happy customer.
B002GY9F9K|3.0|In my opinion this did not stay true to Terry Goodkind's vision.  There is more than enough story in the books to not need to change the story in any way.  Perhaps a little filler here and there to make a complete episode but there's no need whatsoever to change the entire plot.  Quite disappointed.  At least it was entertaining.  And the woman that plays Kahlan is quite lovely.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|I love to rewatch this every now and then no matter the time of year.  (It is set around Christmas time). The characters are quite quirky & loveable.  It's refreshing because its not the same 'ol Holiday movie that has been made & remade over & over.  Also of note, this is not appropriate for all ages, but very entertaining for an appropriate age.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Great Clock for Kindle. I would prefer no adds, but that is what you get for seeking &#34;Free&#34;.on the system.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Awesome movie for any Sci-fi lover!  Beyond the actual story line is a terrific message for all humanity as well.  Lots of action, suspense & imagination.
1476734941|5.0|Sure you probably could just fast for two days & eat normally the other five days a week, which is what I did before the book arrived.  The book adds quite a bit of information that I find very helpful and I believe helps me stay on track.  One of the best results of this diet plan is that I no longer wish to eat as much on the days I'm not fasting.  Love it.
1577314808|5.0|Like the other book of Tolle (&#34;A new earth&#34;) this book is very inspiring. I would suggest it to everybody.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This is a visual feast.  It's amazing that water, a boat, and two characters could keep me entranced for two hours.  Beautifully done!
0452289963|5.0|This is an excellent book. You might not understand everything the first time you read it, but it is really worth a try. It will explain you how most of the time we are victims of our own mind and what we can do about that.
B0084670FU|1.0|it was the worst movie have ever seen, I would never watch any more would not recomend it to anyone
B000687M48|4.0|I have the music, this is my second real Evanescence CD. My fianc&eacute;e bought it for my 20th birthday. I was sooooo happy. He's so sweet!
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Very different. Was very pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Enjoyed the movie greatly. Kept you guessing what was next.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|If you look at the reviews for this game, there are no reviews under a 3 star that are not from \\"trolls\\".<br />It is in many ways, just like the original but with some added features- a school lesson on Personas, live music videos, gameplay cutscenes, online help in dungeons, new social links, and most impressive is how good the gameplay looks. It is so clear and detailed it almost jumps from the screen in 3D.<br />That said, I LOVE LOVE LOVE this game although I am not a huge RPG fan, but it will not be for everyone. It is NOT a fighting game like Persona 4 Arena. There is a story. There is text reading.<br />What is it about for anyone who has never heard of it? A new student comes to stay in a small Japanese town, and strange murders begin that coincide with the start of a mysterious program that shows up on TV on rainy nights. The bodies turn up upside down on roofs and poles. The student ends up falling into a TV with his new friends and discover that the murdered people were somehow thrown in there and killed. When another student disappears, she appears on the mysterious program and they jump back in to save her. While in the TV, the students meet the dark sides of themselves, called shadows, and if they can defeat them and accept them...they become creatures they can call on to defend them in battle against demon shadows inside. With a giant bear costume...creature, they decide to solve the mystery and find the murderer.<br />What can you expect from the gameplay?<br />It is an RPG game where you roam freely around the world, making friends and social links, taking jobs, attending class, and going into the TV to battle in dungeons. The battle is free roam until you run into a shadow and then you fight in in a turn based RPG battle. NOt tactics, so very easy. PIck a physical or magical attack, heal, boost, or use items. You wake up, go to class, participate in clubs, activities, or hang out, go home, study or work or play...then repeat.<br />What else can you expect?<br />Japanese humor that at times will have you literally laughing out loud. Not many forms of entertainment can accomplish that with me.<br />Actual socializing and talking to other people to accept quests, build friendships, and level up personal knowledge, courage, understanding, and diligence through all of those activities.<br />It has an in depth story, and you may spend time reading and watching cut scenes.<br />Be prepared to spend hours leveling up and passing the days with activities.<br />If you hate reading, this is not for you.<br />If you hate anime, this is not for you.<br />There is quite a bit of loud poppy Japanese music, but it grows on you like a fungus.<br />The humor can border on typical Japanese perversion commonly seen in anime, but if you have a sense of humor, you should be fine.<br />Some of the dubbed voice-acting (Chie!) can be a little shrill, but not a huge deal. There are no Japanese language with subtitle options.<br />If you are still unsure, I suggest watching the trailer, watching a gameplay video of both battle and regular gameplay, and then running out to get the game. I also recommend Persona 3 Ps2 or PSP.<br />I am only about 24 hours of gameplay in, but judging from how fast Persona 3 went by, it will end all too quickly.<br />I cannot speak more highly about this series, just based on the last two entries and both ports, and can't wait for Persona 5!expect?<br />Japanese humor that at times will have you literally laughing out loud.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome and good for playing when I am bored.<br />It never gets old and I think there should be more settings than<br />New York and Rio.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I prefer to read the book before  seeing the movie.  I hope the movie is as good as the book!  The characters and story are unique and it pulls you into a world that many are living in day to day.  Good job!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Howey gives you a stimulating and interesting look at how people could justify truly horrible actions.  Indeed, how they could even feel compelled to continue such acts.  What starts out as a fascinating sci/fi story takes you to explore an ethical dilemma, and even be sympathetic to the &#34;bad guys&#34;.  Heroine Juliette's musings near the end, coming to sympathize and even identify, with her adversary compells the reader to consider questions that none of us couldimagine ourselves making.
B002GTZSZU|5.0|Beautifully done!  I've watched this movie many times and will watch it many more.  The things that hold my interest in a movie are great acting, lots of humor to temper the human condition portrayed, and the music, of course, is wonderful.
1451695195|3.0|Interesting to read. I am a Christian and I always look a person to see how they handle their Christian faith.
B000PY6BBI|3.0|I seen this movie awhile back and thought it was a pretty good. But the picture quality was so bad,I turned it off after a few minutes.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Vivid descriptions of the garden, which is similar to my own &#34;secret (Berkeley, CA) garden&#34;. (smile)<br /><br />Again, some minor editing errors.  The book by far outweighs any of the 4 productions, film & live,I've seen of THE SECRET GARDEN.
B008Y79IUE|2.0|The story was bad, Acting was boring. Kept us dozing off. Couldn't finish watching the film. Not my kind of movie.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|I've only watched two episodes and I'm a fan now.  I look forward to watching more episodes on Amazon Prime.
0446693804|5.0|i love all the sparks books. Its interesting how each book brings a whole new adventure.<br />Each book written in different context.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|Started out funny, then got pretty sad as the main characters stopped communicating with each other and the unnecessary drama.
0930289234|3.0|The book was in great condition, but the story just wasn't really for me. Anyone who loves the psychology of superheros would really get into this book!
0765325950|5.0|I purchased the first book in the series shortly after it was published over 20 years ago. I would have never purchased it if I’d known it wouldn’t end until 14 books and 23 years later. Sometimes it’s good not to know things; I would have missed a great adventure. This book got off to a good start reintroducing the characters and with plenty of action but about midway through it seemed to get bogged down in details. It started to drag on and I started to suspect that after everything that had happened the ending could not possibly live up to my expectations. Once again I was wrong. The ending was magnificent.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|Great app to keep track of the many things we do during the day. Such as work breaks, lunch, laundry, and cooking.
1455502626|5.0|Not only do you get an adventure with DeMille's stories, you also get a history lesson!  Very fast paced and lots of action.
B00B8SSWSK|5.0|great experience from depeche mode..great album, great sounds as usually...<br />specially, i love all that's mine, always, alone, soft touch and should be higher
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|This movie was truly great. Every actor could have been nominated for an Oscar. The best though were Tommy Lee Jones and Daniel Day-Lewis.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great book I can't wait to start the next book.  It is a great series to read.  Will recommends to friends
B007WFR0QS|5.0|Really love this album.  Emeli has such a wonderful voice and I'm sure this won't be her last album.  Super fast shipping.  Thanks.
B004I744AS|5.0|has sum really cool features. interesting facts. I use it as a way to slowly back into my writing mode.
B007SGM084|5.0|it was a very good read,kept my attention,the characters were very interesting,i could cry as well as laugh with and for them.
0937381888|5.0|Bought it as a present for a german friend. For myself too, could not resist!<br />Describes everything you need to start brewing, including home-made tools and barrels, etc. Simply great.<br /><br />Only con : it has all the details to brew beer, and can be intimidating. But hey, who said brewing beer is so easy?<br /><br />If you are interested in brewing beer at home, tinkering to make your own equipment in the process, as a hobby : buy this book!
B002QNBRXS|5.0|Seriously what is there not to love about Dexter? When I was first asked about Dexter I thought of the little blonde german accented animated little boy. &#34;No, Dexter, just Dexter.&#34; Was the response. Think more adult. I shook my head no and said what's it about? My co-worker gave me a quick run down and i said I'd check it out. So check it out I did. I was hooked. I then got my 23 yr old son watching Dexter.It is amazing watching as he works to 'fit in'. Warning though if you've watched seasons 1-3, and have some favorite characters,not everyone makes it through this time.
B00594XOZU|4.0|It's ok, but it might need a little improving... like, maybe make it a little  more spaced out, roomy!! Love,<br />  Becka
B005MLOKXA|4.0|The series can be some what repetitive, but the depth of the various characters make the series engaging. It is particularly good for those who like courtroom dramas.
B008458O3S|5.0|Play the game from the start to understand the rules.  Multiple ways to solve the puzzles.  Good game to pass the time.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I can not think of any of Michael Connelly  books that I would not enjoy reading.  Anyone who reads their first book by this author<br />will be a fan forever.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Puzzle games are my favorite.  Quell Reflect was challenging and I welcomed it.  Worth my time playing.  Addicting!!!  I played and I wanted to finish as quickly as possible.
0553801473|1.0|I can't say it any better than some of the other reviewers already have said it. The author has lost his way, developed too many characters that we don't care about, and spent too many words saying nothing.<br /><br />I wish I had not spent the money and much more importantly the time on this book. This author is too busy writing cookbooks and blogging about football, he should turn the franchise over to someone else so they can at least finish the stories. We read books to escape not to be tortured.<br /><br />Also - the american tolkein? Really? The way these last 2 books have been, they really are just rated M or NC17 soap operas.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:<br />Cliffhangers that simply do not get resolved (e.g. Brienne, how did she get out of being hung? - thought it would be resolved in this book? WRONG).<br /><br />Seige by Stannis, and then it's over with NO DETAILS. Wow. Big twist with the onion knight. He's dead, he's not dead - in the end who cares nothing happens. Just a huge waste of time.
0451232852|5.0|I can't put it down.....not finished but loving it. Follett is a master at story telling and weaving history into the story.
B000FCKGPC|1.0|SPOILER ALERT (you never know what's a spoiler to someone)<br /><br />Unlike the original 3 books, this one plods along and nothing much happens. When it ended I was shocked to read &#34;Meantime back at the wall&#34; like it was a joke. The author basically says &#34;Hey the book got so long I had to break it up and guess what, the next book - we're not going to resolve anything we're just going to read about the same crap you read here from the POV of another billionty characters but don't worry I've already written it and it's coming asap&#34; Meantime it was like what 5 years to get the next book out - and that one was supposedly already written? Like a fool I bought it (kindle) right after I finished this one, and guess what it's more of the same and worse.<br /><br />This is not the american tolkein. This is the american lazy slow writer who is too busy doing a million other things besides actually advancing this plot.<br /><br />As the author is fond of saying &#34;A mummer's farce&#34;.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I had a problem with with the item having minor cosmetic damage on the box.  After I informed them they shipped out a new item.  Great customer service.  I would definitely do business with them again.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|The Robots are still killing it, this and Bankrupt! are gonna be my summer albums, I already know it. Get Lucky!
B001AQR3MQ|5.0|Great movie and looks even better on Blu-Ray.  Love Robin Williams and this is a very artistic dream like movie.
0060936223|5.0|This book is an interesting account of then live of avant guard artists in NYC. It is well written and suspenseful, surprising and insightful.  We get to know the counterculture of the sixties in a way that evokes empathy and understanding for an unusual relationship and commitment to the struggle.
B000BP86OG|5.0|Mostly press said this wasn't a good album, I think this one is GREAT! Songs like &#34;Hazel eyes&#34;, &#34; Bald&#34; and &#34;Knockers&#34; are art pieces. This albums Rocks!
0525423656|5.0|She finds the series to be very interesting and cannot seem to put the books down to focus on the important things.
0385349947|3.0|The most fascinating thing about Sandberg's book is the discussion it is provoking -- and I haven't even checked Facebook!<br /><br />Let me confess. I'm not the prospective reader Sheryl is writing for. When she was born I was already a working professional in an academic environment. Of course I experienced discrimination. But I can see my grandchildren rolling their eyes about grandma's party line telephone and no cell phones. You probably don't want to know what I did when my gasoline credit card was cancelled when I informed the company of my married name -- never mind that I had the same position and same salary as a professor at a major university and that my husband temporarily lived in another state. They would only issue me a card in his name based on his salary.<br /><br />That world has changed as much as telephones and some of us helped change it. Actually I agree with Sandberg's point that woman need to take more responsibility for establishing their equality both in their work and home environments.<br /><br />But I'm seriously confused.  Why does she proudly label herself a feminist, and define that as \\"someone who believes in social, political, and economic equality of the sexes\\"? I can't accept that. I've believed in gender equality my entire life and I've always thought of myself as a humanist. I wonder if masculinists define themselves the same way. But I've never met one.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Very entertaining for adults and kids!  My child scratched his first DVD and wanted me to order another one because he likes it so much!
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|i haven't finished reading this yet, but did anyone else notice the description of vida winter's having \\"been named most beloved author, translated into 49 languages, and statistically most disputed question being: has she sold more copies than the bible...\\" to be almost an exact description of agatha christie?
B00B935SUY|5.0|This movie takes you through the world of the recording industry in a way that shows the true underbelly. The studios of Sound City were the start and high-points of a lot of vital music over the years. It shaped the way people looked at making music and this movie does a great job portraying that history. Dave Grohl is a great story teller and did a wonderful job telling the story of this piece of history.
1476734941|4.0|This is a good book, I have been on this for 2 weeks and have lost 5 pounds. Im not hungry on my fasting days. My Husband wanted to do this with me so it is a great to share this with him.<br />I got my sister one of these books and they are doing the 5;2 fast diet as well.
0525478817|5.0|Very different story line, quite sad, but also much dry humor. Many friends have also read this book, all have given a good rating.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Pretty funny compared to most comedies these days.  it drags toward the end and the characters never seem to learn the life lessons in front of them..
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follett is so good at painting a picture with his words. Some parts are hard to read because of what happened to so many people, but I know he tries to follow what was going on at the time.  Great read. Have enjoyed all of the books I have read of his.
B00B0U2SFE|5.0|This film is a work of art that only gets better with age.  Everyone involved in the work seems to have approached it as a labor of love and devotion to emotional truth.  Five stars are not enough.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I absolutely loved this book - I laughed a lot and shed a few tears and especially loved the style of his writing.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|great app worth the low price. I hope the expansions come out soon. I find mysels playing this all the time.
B00BJS7104|3.0|Not one of Tarrantino's better films.  Christof Waltz is the only interesting character in the whole movie.  He's basically the same character as in Inglourius Basterds but honestly I'm OK with that.  I do like the 60's western music too, but those two on their own don't exactly make for a good movie.
034580404X|3.0|This was suppostely a great gift, but she haven't read it so far... so on my opinion, the book is not that great..
B0063IH60K|4.0|Works just like a game of solitude should. You can choose between 1 and 3 card flip. There are other personalization options as well, card back design and such.
B00AESN8XY|1.0|someone tellcme why the hell someone would want to infect the whole planet also why it doesn't make sense at all doesn't have a point
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Perfect series. Perfect characters. Perfect authors. Perfect ending. Truly the best book I have ever had the privilege of reading.
B00457WZEI|4.0|As a 4th grader, I had to read a historical fiction. This was a great book about a horse and his boy and the people they meet along the way. It's about how awful war is, and sad. I'm glad I got to read this book.
B003Z6WFWC|4.0|Like they say 'Words from mouth, waves off tides, once out never come back'. There is immense power in human words, words which come out of mouth and can move mountains and change the entire course of history. Yes you might not see the effect of it instantly, however it has long-lasting effect.<br />Debating is a great way to put our point across and argue in a sensible way.<br />Do you strongly feel about something ? If there is a problem, there are two ways: One, go shout, make noise,be violent and involve in physical abuse and other organize your thoughts, do enough research, evaluate pros and cons and articulate/debate in a respectable manner in a public setting, where the point is conveyed across. That is the power what we humans have. Once we convey the message across EXACTLY in the same way we feel about it, we automatically have convinced others to agree with us. We don't have to scream, shout after that point. People will support and be with you once we cross the chasm of convincing them.<br />This movie is wonderful in that a small college in Texas wins over Harvard in a debate. It shows how one can debate on a sensitive issue in a non-violent way, yet pierce through the hearts of people. Watch it to understand that the greatest impact mostly can be made through mutual respect, non-violence and civil disobedience. Terror, hatred and physical abuse are short-lived and won't change much.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This was an interesting game with a lot of different scenes and puzzles to solve.  With the price of the upgrade.

B00BHMETKC|5.0|Awesomely written, produced, and acted!  I've seen it twice more since!  Ben Affleck has really outdone himself.  My favorite line in the movie, is, of course, Argo *&^% yourself.
0385349947|5.0|To all the haters out there- this book is so spot on.  Sheryly Sandberg raises real issues that impact woman on a daily basis.  As a female in mid to senior management, I have encountered many of the double standards she outlines head on.  And her advice is so basic but so true- it's up to us to ask for what we want.  Sure, we're labeled as confrontational and argumentative....but we must do it.  And it's ok to cry once in a while (damn hormones)  So many of my female friends are floored by the fact that I NEVER accept the first salary/raise offer and think I must be seen as rude at the office.  Well maybe, but you know what?  Now, I make more than them so there!  And thanks Sheryl for reminding all woman they should do the same.  Don't wait to be called on- but stand up and yell your point ladies!
B004ZN9W5M|4.0|All the songs were great, just as I suspected. CD's are getting harder to find.<br />THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY
B003XE3G9M|3.0|I have two pairs of Crocs and I ordered this pair in the same size.  It's not too small, except the heel stap seems to be a bit short, pushing my toe to the front of the show.  I'm hoping this will stretch a bit with wear.  Otherwise, I like the style and color - low key and can be worn with capris or long pants for spring.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This particular book had a lot of humor. Laughed out loud. While I like all of his novels because his characters are complex and his plots so intricate,  this one had an educational aspect about Yemen and how difficult it is in the middle east to establish a sane policy.

B008J34466|5.0|Another great album by Pink! Fun house was a grand slam, but The Truth About Love is still a home run.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|This is a solid alarm app. The only down side I have is when the alarm goes off you have a choice of turning it off or snoozing. The touch buttons and font are too small. A few times I have hit the wrong button and reset the alarm. Woke up by the grace of God lol. I set multiple alarms just in case now. Over all it a good app tho.
B003RRY60S|5.0|I loved reading this story! I literally could not put it down! It just shows how far the doctor and rose would go to save each other
0470474874|4.0|If you want to learn from scratch, this may not be the best way.  The writing is very dry, and without examples or your own heavy workload to give you many many many many hours of practice, a lot of his helpful tips and tricks won't help.  If you're already excel savvy, get this book now.  Skip chapters and sections everywhere, and learn all his cool tips.  If you need to use Excel, get this book.

1118109791|2.0|I had an outdated copy of The Princeton Review's &#34;Cracking the GMAT&#34; 2009 edition and realized I would need something more current to study for the GMAT. I purchased this book after reading the reviews and I must say this was a total waste of money. This book is in a practice test/word key format, whereas the &#34;Cracking the GMAT&#34; book actually explained the thought process behind each example and why GMAC wants you to answer a certain way. I opened this book ONCE. Total waste of money.
B004M8S3Y6|5.0|This book for many will probably fall into the GTD category......the bible for a particular way of life. Fluff free and full of great information, particularly on productivity.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Upgraded as soon as I started using. Like the feature of combining sounds and the ability to play in the backround. Connect to external speakers to really hear the quality of the sound.

B002YIHO7I|3.0|I should have read whatever reviews were on this CD.  If I had, I would have only downloaded two songs from it.  Next time, I'll read the reviews.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Rush just keeps getting better. Most bands can't put material like this out, let alone after 35+ years. If you're new to Rush, get this album. If you're not new to Rush, you already have this album.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|The app itself installed, but every time I open it, it keeps downloading a new file and then closes. Reopening it results in downloading a new files, typically of a different size (Ranging between 64 and 119 MB files). I tried uninstalling and re-installing 3 times to no avail. I have been trying the stubborn route and just keep installing the files to see if that works, but I am probably 30 tried in right now and no change either. Too bad, it seems like a fun app.

B008JFUO0Y|5.0|As is everyone who has reviewed this movie thus far, I am a huge fan of the original Evil Dead and Army of Darkness films. So needless to say, I was incredibly excited when I heard about another installment. That being said, it drives me crazy when people get irritated about remakes and reboots being \\"nothing compared to the original\\". Obviously you'll like the one you saw first better. If you started by watching ED2013, then went back and watched ED1982, I'm sorry but the original would be laughable. If you wanted the original, go watch the original! This is a NEW MOVIE!<br /><br />Also, stop complaining that this one isn't funny. \\"Funny\\" never showed up until Evil Dead 2, so your point is moot.<br /><br />Now that I have my rant out, this version of Evil Dead is absolutely killer. I don't really look at it as a remake so much as another installment, as the characters and story are different. I loved the idea of the group going out to the remote cabin to help Mia get over her addiction. It cements two things: 1) the reason they would go there in the first place and 2) whey they are so adamant about not leaving. Every other horror movie you can't help but think \\"yeah right if that was me I would've just gotten the hell out of there!\\" ED2013 gives you a reason to stay put.<br /><br />The acting and special effects are wildly refreshing. The Evil Dead franchise is notorious for being over the top and radical. And here they do take violence to a whole new level of disturbing, but the practical effects and the actors both keep everything grounded in reality.<br /><br />And Dead Fans worry not. There are plenty of nods and homages to the original. The boomstick and the chainsaw both make worthy appearances. When Mia finally grabs the chainsaw, I couldn't help but let out a little victory fist pump. The handheld camera in the woods returns, the bridge scene is far more shocking than before, and some of the gruesome death scenes are revamped for the 21st century. I was pleasantly surprised by the twist on who the hero turns out to be, and the climax is everything you could ask for in a horror film.<br /><br />I couldn't have been happier with this addition the Evil Dead franchise. New fans may not pick up on the little throwbacks, but will be terrified and entertained. Old fans will love it provided they don't have their head up their you-know-what.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|I have issues being able to plug into my computer via the USB cable.  I got this program and now, I can transfer both directions, though it can be a bit slow downloading from the device to the computer.
B0028KF4M4|5.0|As bad as it sounds, you find yourself rooting for Dexter because he kinda &#34;cleans&#34; up the dregs of humanity.
B00BWI3RTA|3.0|I didn't expect rap on a Dido cd.  Son't worry, she didn't rap, but had a few songs where rappers collaborated.  Of course I do understand the trend for many artists to add some to their songs, but it almost always feels strained to me, and doesn't do justice to the artist's original type of music, nor to Rap.  It seems forced.  I wish the songs w/the rap segments also had versions on the deluxe cd w/o the rap added in, as I do like the songs!
B005FITIGO|5.0|This is an unusually well acted and directed depiction of what happened on Wall Street that sent the economy tumbling; intense, gripping.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|The 20/20 Experience is a soulful, thoughtful, up tempo CD that you can listen to from beggining to end.  Each song tells a cute, heartfelt story that had me hooked from the time I hit play.  Love it!
B000VIPJKM|4.0|I watched this with my daughters and they really enjoyed it.  It's a little bit corny at times but entertains.
B00328G4Y8|5.0|This album was rushed, Hendrix was contractually required to have 2 albums out in 1967.  Jimi accidentally left the master tapes in the first side of the album in a taxi and the album had to be remixed quickly.  Even so this album is unbelievably cool.  Jimi Hendrix and the Experience couldn't have put together a bad track if they had tried.
B0068FZ0PG|5.0|The movie has always been one of my all time favorites, add to the fact that it is in blu-ray and it is even better. The picture is crystal clear and looks like you are right there on the field.
B0000256VK|5.0|This is Brian Ferry at his most magnificent.  Every track features his sweet croon and the gorgeous, layered music of Roxy Music.  The music review site Allmusic describes this album as sophisticated make out music for yuppies; the music does definitely belong to the 1980s, but it's still a wonderful album.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I've been a fan of the Edgar Rice Burroughs Barsoom series since I was a kid. This movie is much better than its critics made it out to be.  The effects were great, the story kept close to its roots, though there were a few twists thrown in.  Would love to see a sequel.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|Not really what I expected. I really enjoyed this movie with the family. I thought it had a good plot too.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I LOVE Evernote! Not only can I make notes of whatever I want, but the notes are searchable, and available on any device on which I've installed it, with Internet access.  I use it to organize my recipes-with photos-from the web, Pinterest, or my own.  I am also now using it to organize my digital scrapbooking supplies, so I can see what's in each kit, and search for a specific color or theme, using tags. Awesome!
B00C5ZORES|5.0|I think a lot of people are upset that this doesn't sound like the old fall out boy, and that's where the mistake is made. You have to go into listening to this album knowing that the band has \\"killed\\" the old FOB you knew and loved.<br />I pre-ordered this album the day they \\"got back together\\" and since then the little Jr. High kid within me had been so hyped. The day I listened to it, I was kind of disappointed. It was just so poppy and not what I fully expected. But after a few more listens, I came to love it and the same weird lyrics are still there. Definitely, not my favorite FOB album but I still enjoy it and haven't stopped listening to it since I got it.<br />I encourage all hardcore Fall Out Boy fans to at least give it a chance.
B00B5A9FLY|1.0|Here we have the typical Brittish series, starting off with great hope and light-heartedness, trending toward dark oblivion with a bleak fate long after you are sucked in.  The first two seasons were full of hope and positive outlook for the future, then increasing darkness from season three on.  All I can say is that the finale of season 5 was the antithisys of the beginning of the series, a typical depressing Brittish \\"smash your hopes on the rocks\\" ending.  My wife and I have followed this series with more enthusiasm than any we have seen in the past 10 years, replaying every episode of the first 4 season over and over, but watching the final episode less than an hour ago, have thrown the entire set of 5 seasons in the trash.<br /><br />This is fiction and fantasy, and entertainment for the family(which this is billed as) should be uplifting and help us rise above the daily drone of real life.  Instead you chose to develop a great vision of a better world, a fair and just land where all people would be treated equally and with due respect....then smash that whole concept in the last 60 seconds of a 5 year series.  As you would say, BAD FORM!<br /><br />I have several friends with young children watching and truly loving this series and am advising them NOT to let them watch season 5, it will break their hearts and truly depress them, and THAT IS NOT GOOD FOR CHILDREN!<br /><br />I'm sure the writers, producers, and promoters are all laughing all the way to the bank for getting us to waste our hard earned money on this excellent waste of our emotional time.  I know that I for one will never again watch anything from BBC or produced in UK.  They may believe in negative fate, the futility of life, and that all good will eventually fail in this world, but I don't need their pessimistic crap shoved in my face.<br /><br />If you come out with a season 6 to try to ressurect Arthur and redeem your appalling season 5 ending, I and many others will not be buying.

1476715904|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book; Colleen Hoover is now in my favorite author's bag!<br /><br />Slammed is an easy read with a beautiful story about great love and great loss.  I got so emotionally involved with these characters and their journey that I laughed and cried with them, this book really touched my heart. What made this book stand out for me was the way Colleen Hoover introduced the slam poetry into the story. The use of the poetry to portray the characters emotional turmoil or self-discoveries was so unique and compelling that I can now say I am a huge fan of slam poetry!<br /><br />Slammed is a story about a girl named Layken, who moves from Texas, with her mum and younger brother Kel, to Michigan after her father passes away. The first people she meets are her new neighbors Will and his younger brother Caulder.  Layken and Will have such an instant connection they decide to go on a date. Will introduces her to slam poetry performances where Layken discovers Will's past and instantly falls in love with him.  When an unchangeable situation presents itself, they discover they cannot be together and just when Layken thinks her life couldn't get much worse another bomb explodes and she is forced to face yet another great hardship and decision that will change her life forever.<br /><br />This is a book about all the different types of love in its truest forms.  It is about true love but also about the love between a mother and a daughter that is unbreakable.  It is about the love a mother has for her children and her instinct to protect them always, and about the love between siblings that ensures they stand by each other, together as a family.<br /><br />My favorite part of this book was when Layken performed her poem \\"Mean\\".  It had me laughing so hard I was in tears, I can think of a few people in my past I could have written a similar poem about.  I also loved the way Layken and Will performed such passionate and raw poems to each other, leaving themselves so open and vulnerable was a perfect ending to this book.<br /><br />So if you're looking for an easy read full of heart and soul - this book is for you!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A well written book.  I truly incredible story.  A great look in the minds of many German pilots and their motivations behind their actions
B005PK1G76|5.0|Works great as extra storage on my stroller. I think this would probably fit on any stroller. Straps on with quality Velcro and has a small zippered pocket as well as space for two drinks, wallet and cell phone. Happy with my purchase!

B0076NKLRQ|4.0|This enjoyable movie captures the dichotomy of Marilyn Monroe: worshiped to near-hysteria in the public, insecure to the state of near-paralysis in private.  What better way to encapsulate the jarring juxtaposition of those two ill-fitting half-lives than by adapting Colin Clark's fascinating memoir for the big screen. Clark's tale would seem almost Melvin Dummar-esque in its 'truthiness' were it not for this fact: it's the truth.  Clark's recounting of his brief, unexpected role in Monroe's brief, ultimately tragic life during the filming of 1956's [[ASIN:B006SA5XRQ The Prince and the Showgirl]] seems the stuff of fantasy.  That Clark released it only in 1995 (under the title [[ASIN:0312143958 The Prince, the Showgirl, and Me: Six Months on the Set With Marilyn and Olivier]] some 40 years after its unfolding gives one a clear indication of how dear this memory must have remained to his heart. The movie brings across the sense of wonder and serendipity that he must have felt as these events fell into his lap.<br /><br />And who better to capture that feeling than Eddie Redmayne - fresh-faced, eager, brimming with action and yet-unsullied innocence. He's perfect for the role.  As noted by others, Michelle Williams - beautiful in real-life but no one's first thought as a va-va-voom blonde in the curvy Monroe mold - undergoes a physical impressive transformation here to inhabit the very bones and spirit of one of the world's most iconographic women.  I recommend seeing [[ASIN:B0029DV2OE Wendy and Lucy]] to see Williams au natural to get a good idea how afield Monroe is for her physically.  Impressive stuff.<br /><br />There's a treasure trove of other actors here in juicy, sometimes smaller, roles: Kenneth Branagh (so different here than in 'Wallender') as Laurence Olivier; Julia Ormond (who I'd put in every movie) as his then-wife, Vivian Leigh; Dame Judy Dench as co-star Dame Sybil Thorndike; Emma Watson as Lucy, a co-worker and romantic interest for Redmayne's character; and Dominic Cooper (see him in [[ASIN:B006022NRA The Devil's Double]]!) as Milton Greene, co-owner (with the actress) of her production company.  Plus, a little Jim Carter for us Downton fans.  That's a stellar cast.cter; and Dominic Cooper (see him in [[ASIN:B006022NRA The Devil's Double]]!) as Milton Greene, co-owner (with the actress) of her production company.  Plus, a little Jim Carter for us Downton fans.  That's a stellar cast.
B001VLBDD0|2.0|It has the theatrical release, but only for PC viewing.<br />I want a copy of the theatrical release (which is much better, especially in the steal mill) that I can watch on my nice big-screen tv without pluging in my laptop.
B00C7JG0KG|4.0|For those of you upset about OZ being marketed by Disney seperately in 3D and BluRay editions you might be interested in this.

B009LMTDL0|1.0|I simply wasn't interested in what the CEO of Google had to say.  It may be a generational thing since I'm of the generation that was hugely affected by &#34;The Feminine Mystique&#34; & &#34;The Second Sex&#34;, among other books of the day.  Making it into the boardroom didn't interest me then, and it interests me even less at this point in my life; I've been a &#34;recovered&#34; lawyer for a few years now.<br /><br />But Sandberg lost me early on: her big triumph, when she was &#34;big as a whale&#34; pregnant, was to get close proximity parking for pregnant women.  This is a victory?  Perhaps if you've gained 70 pounds while pregnant, you might think so.  But if a woman gained that kind of weight during pregnancy, I'd think she needed the exercise gained walking to & from the car.<br /><br />In other words, I could not relate to this woman.  Nor do I care to.
B000001FDK|1.0|I received my sound track in a very timely manner, but was extremely disappointed to realize that it only had one song on it! I didn't pay much for it but still, the description stated that it was the WHOLE sound track, so naturally, that is what I was expecting. I was unable to return it because I had already discarded the packaging and receipt. Totally ruined my day!
B0010HOZXA|5.0|Loved this movie since seeing it first in the theater! Great plot, excellent performance by all the crew, especially by Catherine , Aaron, and of course by Abigail!
B001HQZJPM|5.0|I did not think I was going to like the first one when it first came out, but boy was i wrong. It was excellent, I was wrong about Brendon Fraser, he was actually good in the leading role. The action was amazing, at the time it was cutting edge graphics. The story was typical bad guys chasing the good guys over lost fortune. However, it was well written & quite enjoyable. The second movie was also good & was one of the first movies that the ROCK was in. He pulled it off as the Scorpion King. Brendon Fraser returned and also was excellent yet again in the sequel. The last movie had Jet Li as the Emperor who had a curse put on him & again Brendon Fraser goes head to head against the evil bad guy. Bottom Line, this is a buy, buy it, buy it, you will watch it again & again
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Action packed DVD. i would recommend this DVD to James Bond fans and alike. Tends to hint that there will be another Bond follow up moive but what roles they will play is to be seen.
B0007OCG56|4.0|Wow, Adam Sandler in a serious family movie. This movie was a shocker, thought it would be silly, but it is serious. Sandler's wife is willing to give up her family, while Sandler gets the hots for his new maid. All the maid wanted was a better life for her daughter & her. The family is on the eve of destruction when all the skeletons come falling out of the closet. Sandler does well here & does not resort to his childish behavior that we know & love. This actually was well written & has realistic issues that confront many families. Bottom Line, buy it, but beware this is not a Sandler movie where he plays a goof, this is a serious movie that is about a family falling apart!
B005S9EKCW|2.0|Purchased this DVD after seeing all the trailers and Pr off what a great movie/plat this was. I was disappointed in the DVD. Too much singing as a Broadway play. I hoped that since it was produced as movie it would be a movie. I would not recommend this DVD if you like moives verus plays.
B007D5E7C2|4.0|Here we go, great cast loaded with stars & it is no surprise that it is a Tarantino film once you get half way into it. Uma Thurman plays the lead & she actually does a nice job in it. Years ago, she was a member of a group of killers & now she is out for revenge against them. One by one she battles them til the climax at the end. The action is fast paced & they are not afraid to show blood. The dialogue is top notch, but you expect that from Tarantino. The sequel is a continuing story that follows Uma in her road to revenge. It is equally good in both action & dialogue. Tarantino fans will be happy. I liked them both, each was equally excellent in the story it told. Bottom Line-you can buy this new & this one is nice since it has both movies in one set!
B003VS0CX8|4.0|The last time I viewed this moive was when it first played in the theathers. I was a good if not better with the blue ray and digital upgrades.
0790731940|5.0|this one was so good when it came out way back when. It featured a popular Mel Gibson who was perfect in the lead role. James Garner was fabulous & then we had Jodie Foster who plays Gibson's nemesis early in the movie & later as his side kick. The movie rolls nicely as Gibson plays a card shark looking to enter a poker tournament. There were some nice twists & the movie does nothing to embarrass the original Maverick. Bottom Line, you can buy this one, you will enjoy it for years to come
B00931JMRE|5.0|Great music.  Always love ZZ Top.  I was able to enjoy this before I saw them live in Austin, TX!
B0000YEEGM|5.0|Cruise plays a jerk & Hoffman plays his brother who has autism. Their father dies & in the will Cruise feels he got short changed. He wants to know who got his father's money & he finds out he has a brother. However, Hoffman plays Charlie who lives in a hospital & suffers from autism, but at the same time he is a savant. Well, Cruise never knew of his brother & at first is combative with him , but as time goes on, he comes to appreciate his brother & they make their way to Vegas as Cruise has a scam in mind to his Charlie & his savant skills. Cruise deserves credit since early on he plays a jerk, butt is redeemed later on & by the end he becomes likable. Bottom Line, yes, buy it, Hoffman is awesome & Cruise does a good job also, you will enjoy this movie
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This program is a great way to see what's going on in the wi-fi bands using a graphical display.  It shows the various networks in use, what channels they are on, and their relative strength.  I've found several uses for it - I can walk around my home and check the relative strength of the signal from my router in each room (adjusting the antennas to get best coverage in the farthest rooms).  My phone supports both the 2.4G and 5G bands, and wi-fi analyzer can display the active networks on either.  Where I live, the 2.4G band is saturated with signals from other apartments and nearby businesses - this app helped me decide to buy a dual band wireless router, since the 5G band is almost empty.  Even if you're just curious about wifi, it's a great way to learn more about it.<br /><br />The program is free, but uses a section of the screen for advertisements.  The ads are not intrusive, and can even be suppressed for a week at a time (giving you a bigger display area for the graphs).
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These are the best books ever . You can't wait to read the next chapter but don't want the book to end. Love all three books.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect coming into this book, but I was very pleasantly surprised. The characters were well developed, the plot was excellent and the pacing was right on. What made the book even better was Hugh's writing style. His turn-of-phrase. I found it often eloquent and frequently had to share passages with others.

B0055QYKQO|4.0|PROS: I wanted to upgrade my 5-year motherboard with the same chipset but faster and more core CPU. This is a good stable board that made my upgrade a breeze. Windows 7 didn't not have any issues installing drivers on first boot and I did not need to reactivate my Windows. I upgraded the BIOS and supports the newest 8-core AMD CPUs. I purchased AMD Phenom II X4 965 Black Edition and everything works smoothly.<br /><br />CONS: The northbridge heats up very fast and reaches very alarming temps. I will need to find a chipset heatsink with fan to replace it.
B00BTYP6QE|3.0|Yes, I know I have not bought the game, but the games are getting formulaic.  Cut the rope to give the candies to the monsters.  Nothing really new from the others.  It just looks a little gimmicky with more monsters to feed.  Not on my to buy list as of yet.
B002SRQ214|5.0|This is a very stable CPU with 4 logical cores. I will not upgrade with more than this since all Fx CPUs wit 4+ cores are just not worth the pricing and even performs less than this.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|King has written many books, most are great,some not so much. This book is at the top of the heap. The characters are 3 dimensional and the story is gripping and flows very well. If you have lived through that time the book has real meaning. It brings you back.

B0083EY9EI|5.0|Love her voice...this is such a soulful, beautiful listen. Love \\"Next to Me\\", \\"Daddy\\" and every track. The lyrics are sang and written with such heartfelt emotion that the track takes you away into that moment of each song.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|I enjoyed Boardwalk Empire Season 1 but was a little underwhelmed.<br />When you have Terrence Winter, Steve Buscemi and Martin Scorsese your expectations are remarkably high and while Season 1 was certainly one of the best thing's on TV at the time it didn't quite live up to the hype.<br /><br />The season was building up to something but then just sort of fizzled away in a rather anti climatic fashion and then ended on a cliffhanger which felt a little cheap considering how film like most of the series had been.<br /><br />However with Season 2 the show really hit its stride. It continued the story with great gusto and built up to a fantastic ending which was so good that they could have ended the entire show there.<br /><br />Boardwalk Empire looks stunning and has fantastic production values and some of the best actors around.<br /><br />While I enjoyed season 1 and 3 it is season 2 that holds up with the best that HBO has to offer.

B00000G3I2|5.0|I loved my purchase. This a movie that I've watched before with someone else and I wanted my own copy. This was a brand new DVD so it was in excellent condition.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|Thought it was a good movie for the grandkids. They all seemed to like it. Taught them about standing up for what they believe.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I enjoy this game. Me and my kids play this game a few times a week. It is a fun way to pass the time. I think you should try this game.
030745455X|4.0|I finally got around to reading this book.  I sort of fell into the series - I saw the movie \\"the girl with the dragon tattoo\\" and decided to buy this second book, \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\".  I do recommend reading the first book or watching the movie prior to reading this second book as there are scenes in it that will make better sense to you.<br /><br />Anyway, similar to the first (although I saw the movie and did not read the book) this book held my attention with many action packed adventures.<br /><br />There are several points when the book seems a bit overly descriptive and long, I found myself skipping over paragraphs of extra detail.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I liked this game but it was not interesting enough for me. But my son loved it, if you have kids they might like this game. my son plays it a lot.
0345495004|5.0|An engaging novel about Frank Lloyd Wright and his mistress, both of whom left their spouses and children in order to be together.  Horan did her historical homework and then fills in the facts with possible conversations and motives that make the book difficult to put down.

B006VFLIYK|1.0|Very dissappointing!  Contrived and confusing! Not up to past books.  I had to force my self to finish the book.
B00BHMF578|4.0|The movie falls short in terms of representing the actual events reported . I would think Matt Daemon in place of Ben Affleck would have added more intensity to the movie

B0097EWK3A|4.0|Ghosts of Maple Creek is a list type HOG and it's a good one. I've been waiting a long time for part 2, though. What' taking so long???
B00280LYIM|5.0|My son plowed through this book in only a few days.  It kept his attention even at his after school program with lots of action buzzing all around him.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Awesome. Addictive. Lost for hours, requires internet, uses a little extra space but very nice game.<br />Love this game endless fun, multiplayer battles
B0085LMFAE|5.0|One of the best albums I've ever heard. An absolute must listen. The rhythms are incredible and drivingly, relentlessly danceable.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book has inspired me to take charge of the things in my life that I have let slip away.  The natural peace that I desire is attained by reading and following this great book of wisdom.  It pleases me that I was in the right place at the right time to get what I got so as to pass it on to others within and even outside of my circle.  So much so that many of them have also acquired the book.<br />From sharing my love for these pages of power and growth, I am approached often by someone who has found this compilation of serenity to be a powerful tool for seeing who they really are. I am told that It has helped them face what they may have not been willing to face about themselves. THE TRUTH!!!<br />I would recommend this book of wisdom to anyone who is mindful of life and realizes that sustainability is within these pages, but only if they are willing to focus and allow the truth to be told.  It may be comprised of everyday issues, but these issues are still relevant and worthy of discussion and practice in ours lives today.  Not only today..........  Blessings<br /><br />Dr. Wanza
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My 6 year old son loves it!!! He has watched it about 8 times already!!! I think this is his favorite movie.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my neice. She really enjoy listening to Adele. The package came on time.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|Great Movie Nothing like a good laugh. Its a movie I put in when I have company always great reviews from everyone who has watched it at our home.
0783225849|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT SUSPENSFUL MOVIE WITH A LOT OF DETECTIVE ACTION.  I FEEL IT OFFERS A LOT TO EVERYONE.  ALFRED HITCHCOCK WAS A GREAT DIRECTOR WITH A LOT OF EXCELLENT SHOWS AND MOVIES!
B000WC3864|5.0|This movie still comfortably sets the bench mark for delivering genuine scares, whilst incorperating nearly every key aspect of what makes a horror film great.<br /><br />It was never meant to be a comedy film. In contrast to how he's played in the sequels, the main character Ash is very scared and strung out throughout the story.<br /><br />I still love the weird camera tracking work in this film.<br /><br />Whilst the sequels are fun and take things into a more high fantasy direction, this film is by far the best and will probably never be dethroned.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES.  I AM PLEASED TO HAVE THIS MOVIE AS I LIKE TO WATCH IT REPEATIDLY. I VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE WHO ENJOYS A SUSPENSEFUL GENRE!
B004BDJS9Q|5.0|I think this is such a fun and entertaining movie. Just a different concept blending humor, and almost comic book like action. You should see it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wonderful beginning and ending to the story, enjoyed every page! I love how the story was written out, not to reveal anything until the very end
B00CDT41RY|2.0|Wasn't looking forward to watching this movie but was recommended by some co-workers. Won't watch their recommendations again. Felt uncomfortable with the amount of the certain words used throughout the movie. While I understand they are depicting the history of slavery, this was way over the top and unnecessary.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|played on my kindle fire with no glitches. fun game to play with great graphics and lots of adventure.  thanks for the great game.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I enjoyed most of the book, but didn't like the ending at all. I don't know who should have been responsible for the deaths.
1419705849|5.0|I bought this book for my son and he was totally thrilled with the next book in the series. I am sure he will get all of them.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I am really enjoying this show. The characters are caught up in a type of scandal we have seen all too often, but they react in interesting, very human ways. The show is often funny and moving, with some very strong sexual tension between characters. The Good Wife is a great escape from reality!
B00A18KCSQ|5.0|New album from one of greatest bands of our time. Love it and waiting for new records. Cheers and good luck!
B009AMANH4|2.0|Short but to the point: although Daniel Day Lewis is a fine actor this movie has much to be desired.  It is not about Lincoln; it a front loaded, liberals vantage point on the 13th amendment, if only that.  Not a good movie.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Great record from Legends.<br />Just relax and enjoy. Waiting for DM in Tel Aviv 7/5/13 to hear Should Be Higher, Soothe My Soul and more live =)
B000FA675C|5.0|One of the Best books of that year by Dan Brown, just can not put away awesome reading, full of twists..
B00B1MHA18|5.0|To combine these two great artists was a briliant idea. I can not recommend this album enough. Hopefully, they'll make another.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book goes to show that there's always room for improvement in a marriage and I've learned of things that I've never thought of before!
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|If you liked the movie &#34;Lncoln&#34; you will love this combo pack.  The Movie is great and I love combo packs.<br /><br />The Blu-ray transfer is everything you should expect.  I'll say the same for the DVD.  Having a digital copy that I can access from my iOS devices (iPhone, iPad, AppleTV) and computers makes any film more accessible.  The transfer/activation of the digital copy is easy.<br /><br />For any Blu-ray/DVD/Digital version of a film, it begins with the source.  &#34;Lincoln&#34; is a terrific.  I gave it an 8 1/2 out of 10.  Daniel Day Lewis is amazing.  The best thing about the movie is the portrayal of Lincoln, the man.  But it doesn't stop there.  Any complaints I have about this movie are minor, Sally Fields, though she gives a terrific acting performance was miscast.  I thought there were 2 better places to end this film than were it was ended.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This was interesting for many reasons.  The story itself was thrilling, the retro wardrobes, hairstyles, eyewear really took you back.  The movie kept my interest and certainly made you realize how dangerous foreign service really is.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|I read this 10 years ago and has forgotten what an awesome serries this was.  Am loving re reading the legends of Drizzt again
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|If you want to read something classic but don't want to invest a lot of time in it, this is the book.  I had read this when I was younger and had seen the movie.  However, if you were required to read in school and several decades have passed, read it again!
B000071ZZI|5.0|Suspense, intrique, fast paced, our government at its worst no ethics or morality, no right or wrong, raw; yet refreshingly not every word is a swear word.  There does NOT need to be with gutsy action like this.  Matt Damon is a winner in all the &#34;Bourne&#34; DVDs.
B005SDB6RK|5.0|This is one of the best snowboarding videos I've ever seen. Though it's all backcountry and heli rides, it's more the scenery, the aerial shots and the back story about what it took to get to these places that makes it a complete package. Great music too. Not a lot of videos have such a memorable and enjoyable soundtrack.
B000AP04NI|4.0|Classic! Wanted to get all the wonderful songs on DVD. I would definitely recommend this and I was very pleased with the quality of color too.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This show keeps you wondering what is to happen next. Such an exciting and thrilling SHOW! My wife and I watch 2-3 episodes a night we are hooked!
B005LAIGIM|4.0|This was a entertaining DVD to sit down and relax to watch on an evening.  Eddie Murphy's antics are funny.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Flow Free is a lot of fun but all of the advertisements are distracting and a Pain in the a**. We spent good money on the Kindle HD, why continue with the ads???
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|This movie kept me on the edge of my seat......the music was eerie and the acting superb.......I recommend it to anyone who appreciates horror films!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. It was described to me as hauntingly beautiful & it truly is.
1616550414|5.0|If youre a zelda fan. Its a no brainer. The nerd in me wishes it was a bit bigger and more like an actual encyclopedia, but by no means does that take anything away from this book. YOU MUST GET THIS!!!
B000FA675C|3.0|Books are always better than the movie... I lost interest within the first couple chapters.  Glad I didn't have to sit through the entire movie.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is a pretty good game. It's not quite better than temple run but it's still one of the best games I have on my kindle fire HD.Great game over all
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Many e-book vendors offer the chance to read the first couple chapters before buying a book. If you do that with this book you WILL NOT buy it. You will curse Preston and Child and swear never to buy one of their novels again. I bought it without reading the first couple chapters. After reading the first couple chapters, I then cursed Preston and Child and took the oath NEVER AGAIN. However, being of thrifty Scottish descent, I said to myself \\"I bought it, I'm going to finish it!\\" What a fortunate, and might I say brilliant, decision that was. I may never forgive them for the first few chapters, but I will be forever in their debt for the way the novel turned out. Without giving away the story line, let me say that I am awaiting the next novel in the series with baited breath. Thank you Preston & Child.
B001EZ2T7W|5.0|I really enjoyed the story. Special effects were about the same as the series but altogether a nice movie to watch if you were a fan of the series.
B001NEXEEG|4.0|My wife and I had never heard of this flick, and were doubtful about it being as great as its reviewers claim. We were pleasantly surprised by some great characters that we actually cared about.
B000FC0OOU|5.0|Excellent book from a master. We are currently using it for a book club and it is living up to expectations.
B00B7ERH04|5.0|it works great for a kindle camera , love it, you must try it out. I used it for photos , and more.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great drama series and great video quality.  A wonderful way to spend a several evenings or a day escaping everday life.
B005IDXIL2|3.0|its a little slow and confusing but I like it, something you have to be patient with whiles using it, and its not like the real life ones.
B008220D5K|1.0|This movie started out funny and then it's like they lost track of their material and the last hour was s***!!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Love the whole George R. R. Martin series. Definitely worth getting all the books and the kindle is the way to do it
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|What an awesome game. I have always love the original game, but the cut the rope time travel adds more fun to the game.  I can spend hours playing this game.  Each level becomes harder to pass.  I love it.
B009MF56GC|5.0|Has plenty of action a few slow parts. A must have for a Expendables fan. I bought this for my husband and he has enjoyed it!
B005I6EVUG|5.0|My mother had an up and coming birthday and I wanted to get her something unique. This was perfect since she had a kindle. She really loved it. It is a great buy!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Bought for my son-in-law as he is a big fan. He was impressed with this set and loved it. He is hard to buy for so I heard he wanted this and bought it as soon as I saw it.
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|It was entertaining and lived up to the hype. Everything I hoped it would be CD's were in good condtion, lno skipping or stopping
0071766588|1.0|JUst another product made to get money from the international students. Still, some worth in preparing for toefl, but don't you think it charged too much?
B0033H7VI6|4.0|Just got this based on a LOT of positive reviews, unfortunately mostly done on first impressions out of the box. So I'll try to keep it simple with what's missing from most of those.<br /><br />I like the knife for many reasons already described, size, weight, feel and after running it through some paces, batoning, shaving, hatcheting and such, liked it even more. But then I started noticing some small nicks on the blade, which made me think twice because, while I had chopped into some knots, I was chopping into mostly soft lumber. No big deal, the knife blade was acceptably sharp out of the box but wasn't beveled symmetrically so I intended to take it into have it professional beveled after I finished my initial evaluation, but it made me start to think just the same...<br /><br />The kicker came next when I went to start a fire using it with a ferro rod... it wouldn't throw sparks and after grinding some finish off the back strap and trying several more time, I saw marring on the knife. After trying serval different spark sticks all with the same result (sticks that perform flawlessly with other knives including ones I know are  made from 1095 steel), I have to question the type of metal used to make this knife and of course the quality for long term or extreme uses.<br /><br />All that said, since this won't start a fire I can remove the sheath pouch, which I use for fire starting kits, and use it on another sheath. If you consider that ESEE sells a similar pouch for $25, then I only paid about $20-25 for the knife and sheath, and we all know... you get what you pay for. But at that price it still makes a great camping, utility or trunk tool if fire is not necessary and/or you pack a separate fire starting kit, and you have no great expectations. I'm keeping mine though I'm not going to rely on it in \\"extreme survival\\" situations. For that I'll stick to my ESEE 6 with it's lifetime warranty.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I didn't want to read this book however I read five pages and was hooked they were so good I would recommend them to anyone such an amazing trilogy!
0783228007|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It is one of my favorite Eastwood films which is why I ordered it for my personal viewing.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Absolutely loved it I couldn't put it down! Kept me on my toes the whole time! Definitely a must read.
B009DH2PP4|5.0|Everyone interested in brewing beer should read this book.  Invaluable insight into the brewing process.  Beginners should read all of Section 1 and 2 to brew with confidence.
B004GYY714|5.0|Using it on the Kindle Fire HD whenever my local ABC radio station decides to cut into programs I like with their own &#34;expanded&#34; coverage of things like the Boston bombings. Can't always find a station via iTunes radio that doesn't cut in with their own coverage either when such events occur. TuneIn Radio has--so far, and I emphasize so far--been better.
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|The quality of the movie on blu-ray is great, though I haven't watched in 3D yet.  Good extra features are included and show a lot of insight into the making of the movie and the scale of the production.
B0063IH60K|2.0|I'd recommend paying for a good solitaire app, rather than recommend this one. Because this one is &#34;free,&#34; there are annoying ads that pop up each time you start a game. That's why it's free, of course. If you're not bothered by that, then it's an okay version of solitaire.
B000SP1SH6|5.0|This movie is a yearly tradition fot the family to set down and watch the VHS of I decide to get ride of the vhs player so had to get the online version....
B005K17RU0|5.0|I couldn't d/l Weather Underground  which I use on my PC to the Kindle Fire HD, but this app (which is a &#34;product&#34; of ABC Television, I gather) is a good substitute. The inability to access various android/Google items is one of the drawbacks of the tight integration of the Kindle to Amazon's proprietary content.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had me from the beginning to the end. I fell in love with the characters and loved the story line. This is a book you won't regret OR forget.
B008K6HN8I|3.0|Just not certain how to utilize this to the fullest. It doesn't seem to operate similar to downloading via, say, Firefox or IE + Windows. Not as intuitive--at least as far as I'm concerned. Others seem to like it very much...which is why I got hold of it in the first place! Time will tell, I guess, however if you're used to browser downloading + your OS on a PC, well, to me so far this doesn't mimic that very well.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|What a great read. Easy to understand, simple philosophies, and life changing. The very best of the books in the genre.
B000UZNSWM|5.0|encyclopedic  goes into history of China in great detail with accent on the US China lobby--almost too much so but descriptions of the forgotten war are very well done
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|I really didnt know what this movie was about but heard it was great (can you say Oscar?). Anyway, my whole family enjoyed it, from my 14 y.o. son.  We laughed (that's always good).  Glad there was no nudity.  Great movie.
1451673442|5.0|I love all of Rhonda Byrne's books. The &#34;Secret&#34; works.  If you believe and apply yourself the Universe will respond positively.  I am anxiously awaiting anything new that comes from Rhonda Byrne.
B0061QD88S|3.0|I love this movie - haven't tried it with my grandchildren yet, but think they will like it - maybe a little old-fashioned for the new generation but a warm fuzzy for me
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My 16 year old watched it 3 times.  The other kids 13 and 9 watched it a couple of times. Even my husband got drawn into watching it and enjoyed it.
1400069807|2.0|just easier to cook pasta the &#34;old-fashioned&#34; way in my opinion - I accidentally dropped it trying to get it open and the closure broke - threw it in the garbage . . . .
0718177029|5.0|This was one of the best books I ever read.  I had it with me on a flight to Italy and it made the flight go by much quicker.  I am looking forward to reading other books by this author.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|These MDR's are quite possibly one of the greatest set of headphones ever produced by Sony.  The MDR7506 are timeless legends and you will hear sound spectrums that you have never experienced before.
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|This is a beautiful soundtrack! I love the songs w/ words, too! Makes me want to see the movie again!
B008EEB4TA|5.0|I never buy albums, however there is a rare occasion where I love all the songs, and this was one of them.  I love love love every song off this album.  It's a great mix of trance/electronica music mixed with great vocals.<br /><br />I Highly recommend this album.

B0031RS58I|5.0|Great light weight book. Good quick read. Great author highly recommend. Looking forward to next book, series should do a quick sequal with a wedding
B005K17RU0|3.0|The maps have that weather color coding right in the middle of the map.  Surely there is a way to get rid of it? ???  I finally figured out how to navigate the app. Sometimes updates do not make an app better.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|I liked Jeremy Renner's character in this movie.  It kept you guessing about where it was going and what the &#34;chems&#34; were about.  I didn't want it to end.  Looking forward to the next one in the series.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This is a great movie for those who havnt seen it. Would watch it again and reccomend it to everyone
B00BSBY38A|3.0|I felt like this movie was set up in the beginning to really bring home a strong message.  Unfortunately, it was weak on bringing it home.  The movie left the &#34;lesson&#34; unclosed in my opinion.  I liked the story, just think they missed a huge opportunity.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Love this bag I bought it with my Nikon D3200 and it has plenty of space and compartments for the camera,lenses and memory cards and is very sturdy.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|A great story about life's struggles and imperfections and finding a way to &#34;just get on with it&#34; despite whatever challenges are in your path.
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|Like &#34;Knocked Up&#34; but still pretty darn funny especially if you're heading toward or over 40. Definitely worth a see.
0345803507|5.0|Bougnt this for a friend. She read them faster than I read the books and she had never read a book as long as I had know her
B002OSY2T6|2.0|Very lame, my baby  girls just look at it for 1 minute moved it around and never ever give it another try.<br /><br />It does nothing just plays some music, I thought it was going to move so the baby could chase it but no.<br /><br />Really any other plastic figure would be more interesting and much more cheaper.
0345803493|5.0|Bougnt this for a friend. She read them faster than I read the books and she had never read a book as long as I had know her
B000HSKUBE|5.0|Great acting, great story.  Can't wait to see the rest of the series.  Would highly recommend this program.  Hope the rest is as good.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|Liked the CD but was dissapointed it came after Christmas. I have still played it a few time in the car. It is a great sing-a-long.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This book was a great read, kept me on my toes every page that I turned! Recommend it to anyone who loves a good suspenful book, with twists that make you want slap your mama! :)
B004R1VXYU|5.0|These guys truly rock! And they're from Texas! It's like Lynard Skynard with a bit of Texas thrown in to the mix.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved the entire book...I couldn't stop reading.  I wish it wasn't over! This is a great book for historical fiction as well as a great story!
B009GQ57ES|4.0|While Thrift shop is good, it's not the only song that they made that is worth a listen. I'd buy it for much more than the sale price I got.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Held up to its namesake!  It was a Beautiful Disaster!  Passion, intensity, chemistry, trust, loyalty & love!<br /><br />When chemistry happens, you can't pretend it isn't there. That is what Travis & Abby learn. They're attractive & attracted to each other but they both believe they are broken & probably not good for each other.<br /><br />Thing is...they are their best when they are together. Someone says its \\"codependency\\", perhaps it is but when it works, it works and life isn't always tied up nice & neat!  For sure they get each other better than anyone and become best friends....but, they can't deny their chemistry!<br /><br />Only frustration was with both of them hitting the self-destruct WAY too many times for my taste!  But HEA ending suited me fine!<br /><br />Intense & hot read!
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|Just as good as &#34;Knocked Up&#34;. It was a great movie and would watch it again. Funny, inappropriate, and funny.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Great Summer Reading!!!  This book is a really quick read!  I haven't seen the movie but the book was great!
1594481938|3.0|The book was assigned for my book club. I did not finish it, but the first half was a bit odd. Interesting...but odd.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Light reading but very entertaining. I would definitely seek out other books by this author and recommend this book for a fast read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is extremely fun to play its great for kids and adults. Graphics are really cool and all the extras you can purchase with the coins you collect are great too!!!!!!

B004SOR4H6|5.0|This game brings u back to it childhood it is so fun! Tweeting is FUN yet I'm still learning how to tweet
141694737X|3.0|I am very happy with the book, but was upset with the poor wrapping job. The last time I paid for wrapping it was done beautifully so it made this extra disappointing.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Interesting variant to VR as a place to go when things seem to be falling off the cliff of reality, anyway!
B003H4I4JU|5.0|It was better than Ender's Game. That was all battle school, this one was more involved. Piggies??? Whatever!!!<br />I liked the spiritually of it.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I have no problem at all with recommending Stray Souls.  I am not going into game specifics as there is no need.  If you like hidden object and puzzle games with a good background story, then you will enjoy this title.
B000GG4Y3M|5.0|This move did not get the press when it came out or it's props.Mr.Scott should make more movies. .....nuff said
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Intelligent, grown-up fantasy seems so hard to come by.  This series has me yearning for the next in the series.  Hurry, Mr. Rothschild! Hurry!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Absolutely mind boggleing. Very well written and holds your attention throughout the entire book. I was hoping for a different ending until I understood the circumstances. Excellent  title.
1457514508|5.0|Something is not quite right in the leafy Savannah neighborhood of Gordonston.<br />As the friends and fellow members of her afternoon cocktail club gather to mourn the death and lament the life of their neighbor, Thelma Miller, not all is what it seems.<br /><br />When old friends vie for the attention of widower, Alderman and mayoral candidate Elliott, jealousies surface and friendships are strained. An old woman with a dark secret and an infamous uncle plots her revenge for a perceived wrong done over thirty years before, a once successful children's writer with his own secret is haunted by memories of the past and aspiring model Kelly Hudd has just won the trip of a lifetime.<br />As secrets are revealed and history, both old and recent unravel, and an intertwined web of deceits and lies surfaces in the middle class neighborhood, a killer lurks and is anyone really who they seem to be?<br /><br />An enigmatic European gentleman in South America, a young Italian count parading the streets of Paris and a charitable and kindhearted nephew recently arrived from India add to the remarkable assortment of characters in this story of intrigue, deceit and revenge.<br />What is the secret a recently retired accountant is trying to hide and just why did the former showgirl and attractive sixty two year old widow Carla Zipp really have plastic surgery?<br /><br />A mysterious organization with links to organized crime, a handsome fire fighter who can do no wrong and a trio of widows with deep hidden agendas compound a story of simplistic complexity. As twists and turns lead the reader to a conclusion that they will not see coming and a sucker punch ending that will leave you breathless, the Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club's top priority remains the need to chastise the culprit who refuses to `scoop' after his dog walking sessions in their treasured park.<br /><br />I cannot fully express how much I liked this book.This book started of with a very interesting scene that pulls you right in. It just hooks you and doesn't let you go. You are sucked into this small society and all the problems that dwell behind closed doors. I liked the start of this book, I loved the middle and adored the ending. There is just so much going on in this book, but all without becoming confusing, it just keeps you reading until it's done.<br /><br />The story was a very intricately woven carpet of intrigue and very interesting characters. The start of the book just got you really excited for what was about to happen and than it just leaves you hanging. But this just means that you have a question in the back of your mind all the time, right from the start. And then we find out more and more about ever character and somehow that question is pushed back because so many more questions are flooding your mind. But Duncan Whitehead doesn't leave us hanging, because he starts giving us the answers, piece by piece. And by the time you have reached the ending it's time for an epic revelation. I was just mind blown with the ending, and I mean that in the most positive way.<br /><br />The point of view that keeps switching definitely keeps the story very interesting. The switch is always very smooth and it's great to get insight into everyone's situation and how things fit together in the end. It gives so much depth to the situation because you understand how everyone involved is feeling. That's such a powerful tool in storytelling, especially if used correctly.<br /><br />The writing itself was very smooth. The dialogue was very smart and the descriptions were very clever. The book read really easy, probably due to the fact that the story was so interesting and that the writing just made it so enjoyable to read. There's nothing as annoying as liking the story but not being able to stop struggling with the writing. For me this book was definitely a home run, especially because the story was so complex and yet never really hard to follow.<br /><br />I would also liketo mention that I had the opportunity to interview the author of this book, Duncan Whitehead! I will be posting the interview this Thursday, so look out for that!<br />The synopsis was taken from Goodreads
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It works great. Never have a problem with it. Keeps my Kindle charged I would recommend this product. Love it
B007712XAU|5.0|This series is riveting!  Pure escapism!  All the characters have a way of pulling you into their lives through the joys and trials of life set back in the early 1900's.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I love the ability to keep up with friends and family, but it is far from perfect, what is, and some of their newer policies leave a lot to be desired.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Very awesome movie and this is for anyone who loves special forces and history at the same time!!  Jessica Chastain does a superb job as portraying the C.I.A
B004TMPJP6|4.0|I got this originally as an experiment to see if could help me in everyday lists. As it turns out Wunderlists when place on multiple devices allowed me and my wife  keep track of a grocery list that we could both feed in to. so nothing got left out when we went to the store.  Now it's a matter of how many other lists can we collaborate on to keep us both on the same page.  That's value to me.
B000B5XOYI|5.0|I love the Batman movies; I had the movies on VHS and I miss watching the originals from when I was a kid and now I I I can watch the batman movies on DVD; I love it... Like I am seeing the batman originals for the first time...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|.. and I was not disappointed. I found it hard to put the book down. The silo idea seemed novel, I wish I learned more about what happened &#34;outside&#34;, but the book was great. Maybe the sequel....?
B000YABIQ6|5.0|WHEN THIS SHOW FIRST CAME ON THE AIR, I WASN'T A FAN.  BUT I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY WATCH IT ONE DAY WHEN I WAS HOME SICK.  IT ENTERTAINED AND HOOKED ME!!!  THE CHARACTER OF PETE - I BELIEVE HE PLAYED THE PART OF CONNOR ON THE ANGEL SERIES.  WHEN I SEE HIM NOW, HE SEEMS OUT OF CHARACTER.
B00466HN6S|4.0|I would recommend this show to any family with conservative family values.  Many topics are addressed in a fun, light-hearted way.

B001F3FZVK|4.0|My exposure to Cher had previously been through her classics -- \\"Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves,\\" \\"I've Got You Babe,\\" \\"If I Could Turn Back Time,\\" etc. I wasn't quite prepared for \\"modern Cher.\\"<br /><br />These ten tracks are heavily influenced by the loss of Sonny Bono earlier in 1998. Most have an overt love theme. Songs in her past albums did contain the finer emotions, but most concentrated on hardship, betrayal, pain, and being different. It is as if Cher is trying to dance her way into life again, out of her grief and depression. The few musical works that are on this album and are of a negative theme are also not of her usual detailed storyteller style.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />#1 \\"Believe\\" -- Cher uses auto-tuning for the first time. Her voice gets played with by the computer a bit, but that doppler effect gives this song its trademark character. \\"Do you believe in life after love?\\"<br /><br />#3 \\"RunAway\\" -- When relationships go bad, sometimes you have to run away... and do it to a jumpin' dance beat.<br /><br />#5 \\"Strong Enough\\" -- She's strong enough to live without you. By the way, it sounds like you've really been up to no good in this 70s-sounding Cher track.<br /><br />#10 \\"We All Sleep Alone\\" -- This remix of Cher's 1988 single tells us to count on no one but ourselves. Sometimes, a remix is an interesting creative leap.<br /><br />Artist: Cher<br />Year: 1998<br />Tracks: 10<br />Remixes: 1<br /><br />Other Cher I Recommend:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000WOXQEG If I Could Turn Back Time - Cher's Greatest Hits]]

B000002N3J|5.0|The critics said Madonna's career was over. In 1995, she proved them wrong. Her 14-track album \\"Something To Remember\\" put together her most memorable balads with three new recordings. Two of Madonna's previous hits on the collection -- \\"I'll Remember\\" and \\"This Used To Be My Playground\\" -- had never appeared on her own albums before. A re-recording of \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\" garnered acclaim from fans, when differing versions of songs often fall flat.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />#1 \\"I Want  You\\" -- Madonna opens with a haunting rendition of Marvin Gaye's original. Very moody. Very sensual.<br /><br />#2 \\"I'll Remember\\" -- A positive spin on saying goodbye. Often used at graduations. Theme from the film \\"With Honors.\\"<br /><br />#3 \\"Take A Bow\\" -- Life is like a stage, your own play. The act in which he played a part is over. First, hopeful, but ending in goodbye.<br /><br />#4 \\"You'll See\\" -- Feel the power. It is like Celine Dion's balads, but with Madonna's special touch. She doesn't need anyone. You'll see.<br /><br />#5 \\"Crazy For You\\" -- A young-sounding Madonna describes falling in love across a room. Instant attraction. A plain-old-fun track to repeat.<br /><br />#6 \\"This Used To Be My Playground\\" -- Playing during the closing credits of \\"A League Of Their Own,\\" this song is an emotional trip through the past and wishful thinking.<br /><br />#7 \\"Live To Tell\\" -- She's been through so much, but she made it through. She sincerely prays that she's learned her lesson and won't repeat those mistakes. This is one of many versions of this deep and truthful song.<br /><br />Well, I can't continue to write about every song. That's how good the album is though; every track is packed with personality and power. I have my original CD from 1995. It isn't scratched. It was never loaned out, because no one was ever going to scratch it. I'm not a fan of Madonna's more pop-oriented fast-paced pieces, but this balad-laiden CD is a best friend of mine.<br /><br />Artist: Madonna<br />Year: 1995<br />Tracks: 14<br />Prev.

B000031XCR|5.0|Celine Dion put together a greatest hits album to celebrate a single decade of musical accomplishment. Nine of the 16 tracks are tried-and-true favorites, and most are in their familiar radio edit format. The remaining seven songs are new pieces. Four of these seven were later released as radio singles. This compilation provides an echo of the 90s in the comforting, safe, and secure hands of a trusted artist to see us into the 21st century.<br /><br />Important Notes:<br /><br />#3 \\"Beauty And The Beast\\" is from the Disney film by the same name<br />#8 \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" is from the movie \\"Titanic\\"<br />#9 \\"I'm Your Angel\\" is a duet with R.

B000FC1MM8|5.0|How can you miss with another Michael Connelly novel.  Although I like his other novels and have have read them all, Harry is my favorite character.  Just waiting for another new novel!!
1451627297|5.0|We always wonder &#34;what if&#34; and Stephen King has captured this with finesse. There is also a fine love story and, as usual, great character development.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I was sweating pretty soon into it. It is a good workout. Jillian really pushes you and she shows you easier and harder level. I didn't monitor my weightloss results specifically from DVD but I think anybody will tone up from this.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|This is easily one of the best Blu-Ray movies available, especially at this price point ($5). I bought one for myself, liked it so much that I bought one for both my dad and my uncle too!<br /><br />Superb picture quality, sound quality, and a great movie. You probably will not regret this purchase.
B00B2166BS|5.0|Item arrived as advertised.  Check it against usb charging and it does charge my Nexus 10 at 3.68 minutes per 1%,!  Much FASTER BY FAR THEN THE STANDARD MICRO-USB.  I would recommend product and seller!
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I love this game but couldn't get it to work on my kindle the audio wasn't right and it kept delaying and sticking
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Enjoyable. Helen Mirren & Anthony Hopkins are superb. It's easy to forget It's Hopkins you're watching. Mrs. Hitchcock held it down & sent Psycho out in style. Genius, married style.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Although I wanted to hit Abby on more than one occasion, I believe she ended where she needed to be by the end of the story. It was a bit dramatic, especially since they were in college (it had that high school feel at times) but I really enjoyed it.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This is a pretty straight forward app, but I especially love that I can use my pictures as the background.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a thrilling adventure I felt like I was in that arena, my heart racing as Katniss and Peeta faced their many challenges! I would definitely recommend this book!!!
B007N8RULO|4.0|This is a fun game when you try to win as quickly as possible to make a new record time. You advance to higher levels as you improve in skill too. This game gets my mind off my responsibilities for a quick respite.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|It was a little slow at the beginning, but later on it gets better. I recommend this book to young readers and up to adults.it is perfect for every age and its very easy to read and understand.I absolutely love the characters and the story line.in all a great book!¡!¡!¡!
0307476073|2.0|I'm a backpacker and I would never set off on the trail as unprepared and ill-equiped as Cheryl Strayed( who, by the way, changed her name to Strayed for the ludicrous reason that she \\"strayed\\" in her marraige!) One must wonder about Maryann Faithful! Who packs their backpack with a 12 pack of condoms? Does she think she'll get lucky on the trail? I really didn't need to read about her wringing out her foam tampon so she could reuse it. Perhaps this work was meant to be read by other young, angry females who have issues with their mothers and not sixtyish male hiker/backpackers. When she wrote of blaming her mother for her mother's death I thought, what a narcissistic b***h. I thought this book would be about hiking the Pacific Crest Trail and finding ones self. Instead, Strayed comes across as a heroin addict who can't keep her knickers up when encountering the opposite sex. She leaves a wonderfully supportive, kind and gentle husband (her words) for a lowlife scumbag who introduces her to heroin. What a guy! She even finds time to aquire the drug on a break form her hike. One would think that when embarking on a grueling, 2600 mile hike,(as it turns out she only hikes 1100 miles) one would take care not to make the mistakes a novice hiker wouldn't make! The only reason Strayed is alive today is dumb luck and the kindness of strangers! She takes off on this hike alone, presumably knowing that other women, hiking alone, have met their end on the trail. Then she writes of being terrified for a time while riding in a pickup truck alone with the driver and encountering a weirdo on the trail. Well, duh!! I'm male and in pretty good shape and I would think twice about hiking the PCT alone! Then she misses probably the most beautiful part of the trail, the Sierras. After returning to the trail, I expect her to finish her hike, but she chooses instead to end it at the Bridge of the Gods, in Oregon, well short of the Canadian terminus. At least I didn't have to listen to Strayed whine any longer. My only regret is that I didn't purchase Wild! on Audible.com. If I had I could have returned it for another book!
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|This book was funny and so real. Hard to imagine someone as famous as Tina could be so down to earth. I hope she figures out the baby thing!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Time travel stories are a dime a dozen, as are time-travel-to-prevent-a-past-tragedy stories.  While King's take is not especially original, the subject matter is sufficiently compelling to turn a pretty good story into a great read.  King manages to avoid the worst time travel cliches (before arguably succumbing to them in the end) and forgoes lengthy discussions of paradox and causality in favor of storytelling.  He also shows admirable restraint in sharing historical detail, providing enough to fully realize the time and place without spending words on needless minutiae uncovered in his apparently extensive research.  The third act is arguably the weakest, but King caps it off with a strong and emotionally resonant ending.
B004I1K2NW|4.0|I think this is still my favorite Peter Jackson film and my favorite film with Michael J. Fox, after Back to the Future.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Easy read, fun experiments. Started reading this book with a friend so we could talk about our experiences and compare notes
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|I saw the movie on the big screen and wanted a copy of my own.  Was the Broadway musical better then the movie? The answer is yes.  This movie is much better then Mammia Mia the movie.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This is the first car charger that I have reviewed and used that featured device-specific ports; Apple and Android. But, this is great since the Apple port sends out 2.1 amps and the Android sends out 1.5 amps of power. Adding up to 3.6 amps, which  allows you to charge your device quickly with no long waiting times.<br /><br />Taking a closer look at the car charger you will notice that the USB ports are labeled with \\"Apple\\" and \\"Android.\\" As well as the Anker logo on the very top. Which is very well positioned on the gadget itself.<br /><br />There's not much I can say about the product besides that it works very well in whatever environment I placed it in.  Currently, it's support Apple iPads, iPhones, iPads, Samsung Galaxy S2, S3, Note 2, Droid RAZR MAXX, HTC One X, V, and S, plus GPS, PSP, Kindle, Kindle Fire, Nexus 7 and much more.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|The story is told by two different perspectives, that makes it really interesting. Didn't love the ending but it is a book that entertains.
0385537816|5.0|I had borrowed the paperback novels from my sister-in-law, but was hesitant to buy my own copies because I was sure they'd come out in hardcover eventually.... Totally worth the wait! I'm currently remodeling my personal office at home, and can't wait to display them!
B004EPZ06Q|5.0|If you liked the first one this won't let you down! Plus it has a monkey in a jacket you can't go wrong with a monkey!!
B000FC12SM|5.0|I read this book years before and it helped me understand why I my partner reacted so different than I did in almost every area of our relationship.  Now, 16 years later, i recommened it to the man I love, but could not live with.  And, I re read the book.  It totally opened up a new world for both of us and saved our relationship and our lives!  Thank you John Gray....this book is a classic for relationships.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I thought this would work on Kindle, but I didn't read the app when ordering it.  Will try harder next time.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|This album easily deserves 5 stars! Go buy it. One of the best albums I've heard in a long time.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very comprehensive!  I like the way it shows the &#34;tracks&#34; of your calculations!  It has a very crisp screen!  Wow!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works well. Great convenience to have it on my kindle. Use it for basic operations. Would like it better if I could use it horizontally as well as vertically.
B0047ZF5VI|4.0|I like most of these songs. I love a few, and I dislike a few. All in all this is a good effort. I love Trixie's voice. &#34;Last Time&#34; is AWESOME!
B00BLCHYKU|3.0|Glad to be able to catch the episode I missed but I think $2.00 for one episode is too much.
B004FN7ZOC|5.0|Good CD with Live DVD.  Similar to Dimmu Borgir.  The DVD is a three hour concert of them play three of their CDs from start for end.  I plan on seeing them at Mayhem Fest 2013.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|Have not viewed as yet, can not wait, hope it is as good a standard blue ray verson except more pop out type action frames
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Works fine, as advertised. Has multiple rings to choose from. I like the math function but haven't tried the shake yet.
B002ZG99A4|4.0|Christmas present for friend whom just recently go a Blue ray player. He loves action movies these are great movies.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|One of my favorite stories - I had not seen this version and thought it was very well done.  A couple scenes I would have preferred left out regarding a fortune teller and Quiji board game.
B00AZNEW5G|1.0|A great story done very poorly.  Director and photographer should never work again.  Unable to folllow action in dark.  I know it was done at night but all the action was restaged and should have been done so the viewer could follow it.  I noticed that a lot of recent movies are filmed like Piscasso's painting.  Bits and pieces chopped together does not make for viewer involvement and attention.  If this is a &#34;new&#34; school of filming, then they have gone the way of pop music.  Nothing of value was done after the 1970's.
B00102FELM|2.0|Sorry Scorpions and Scorpion fans. The drummer is over-the-top, horribly talented. The drum solo is the only part of this DVD that should've been cutout. It's not worth listening and watching. 3 classic Scorpions songs didn't make it to this: In Search Of The Piece Of Mind, He's a Woman She's a Man, Dynamite. But it includes \\"Bolero\\" and the lame drum solo. SImply horrible. And to make it worse, the song \\"Holiday\\" continues to be mangled. Seems like the Scorpions rarely play this song LIVE, all the way through, as it was written. And please Klaus... this is YOUR BAND; quit trying to get the audience to sing for you. It didn't work in this show. On the production aspect, all the comments are correct: too many scene-cuts. This was seriously OVER-EDITED. This package also should've included AUDIO CD's. Still glad I got it. I'd recommend it but be warned hardcore fans. It's disappointing but work a view (and ripping most songs), minus that drum solo. Glad to see this featured a lot of older stuff (I'm NOT a fan of anything after Blackout).
B000QCS8TW|5.0|A GAME OF THRONES IS ONE OF THE BEST SERIES EVER. THERE IS SO MUCH DIVERSITY. EVERY THING IS THERE. LOVE, HATE, CRUELTY, GENTLENESS. THE STORY  CERTAINLY DOES NOT ALWAYS GO THE WAY YOU THINK OR WANT IT TO. A LOT OF SHOCK FACTERS ARE THERE. IT IS VERY HARD TO PUT DOWN.
B004G7UTXG|5.0|My husband and I both really enjoyed this movie and it was had very beautiful locations and it was very thought provoking!!
B00AMBH70S|5.0|As good as the original actions of the Jason Borne trilogy.  I hope to see more this type of action with this same acting team.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book was very interesting. I wasn't exactly sure what it was about before I read it. It was a good book but was more graphic than expected.
1423140605|4.0|My nephew got lost in this series. Had hours of enjoyable reading. Like the rest of the family he appreciates the simple joy of curling up with a good book.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|great game for a kindle. impressed with the graphics. a discount was offered for my next purchase from the publisher
B005651RDS|5.0|Set in the civil war on Bougainville Island (Papua New Guinea), this is a matter-of-factly written account of life from the point of view of an adolescent native girl Matilda - so named by her absentee father who is working in Australia. Jones interweaves the horrific violence imposed on the villagers by the warring factions, with the magic offered by the local remaining white man, Mr Watts. He teaches the children about the outside world through Dickens' &#34;Great Expectations&#34;, particularly Pip, and invites the village mothers to share their knowledge in class, frequently being at odds with Matilda's devoutly religious mother. This story gives a wonderful yet tragic insight into life in a war zone that the world knew little about, despite it being as recent as 1991.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|This show is not as riveting as I had hoped but it is good. At the end of the day its a British period-piece soap opera with well developed characters.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It was a good story. I just wish she went into more detail. It felt like there were times I was lost in her writing. She would go into great depth with one topic then plow through the rest.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I was surprised how beautifully this movie was made.  It defintiely should have been up for best picture!  The acting was superb and the story intimate and intriquing.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Love having this to watch again and again! Such beautiful music, just a lovely way to spend a snowy day in the mountains!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I feel this movie should have been the Best Movie in 2012.  Such a compelling story, breathtaking photography.  One of those special movies you hope everyone will have a chance to view.  Life Changing!

B004TSXUWY|5.0|really enjoyed this book. its good and has you turning the pages, a book you carn,t put down.a good read
B009439G3Q|5.0|Anyone that doesnt like wasp doesnt get wasp.  I got to grow up with this band in the 80s.  I actually saw them probably 10 times over the years and always liked them.  Blackie was actually one of the people that testified on the capital with Dee Snider for the lyric ban on records.  If I remember right the congressmen were expecting some dim witted singers and if my memory isnt horrible Blackie and Dee sent the senators packing.  Regardless, this is an awesome record.  Great freeway music and great album from the first to the last song.

B00133KFGW|2.0|This is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen.  It came highly recommended, yet the acting is weak, the characters are lame and the storyline goes nowhere.  I have in the past, enjoyed Keri Russell, but she sucks in this movie.  I give it a &#34;1&#34;

B00BHMETKC|4.0|Ben Affleck, the guy who used to be easy to hate, delivers again.  And Alan Arkin is one of the all-time greats - they could have made a move where he just talks about &#34;counting the wrinkles on my dog's b---s&#34; for 2 hours and I'd watch it.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I really liked this series but was upset that I missed the first few shows. I was able to catch up in one day thanks.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Amazing storytelling in an amazing world!  Can't wait for the rest of the books.  You'll be hooked from page one.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|From the opening scene to the poignant ending, I was mesmerized! It was exquisite.  I went into the theatre and saw it 3 times.  I bought the CD and play it every day. I bought the DVD as soon as it was released and relished every second of the documentary narrated by Mr. Hooper.  After listening to Tom Hooper mention parts of the book that influenced him, I bought the book.  Oh if only I could have been quietly in the room when Mr. Hooper was in front of the orchestra, I would have been beside myself.  Such talent...Hugh Jackman (Mr. Hooper says he was able to make this movie because Hugh Jackman was alive), Anne Hathaway (of course she won every award!), Eddie Redmayne (great actor...who knew he had a voice like an angel?).  Tom Hooper and the cast gave us a gift.  I'm thankful that technology allows me to enjoy it over and over.  There are not enough stars in the heavens to rate this product!

B0084BMUFA|5.0|I loved watching the movie during the holidays but always wanted to read the book and finally got to it. I loved the styling of the writing and its authenticity. Thanks Amazon.
0307949486|4.0|I started reading the series because I heard so many good things about it and I'm glad I finally read it. However, there are some downfalls with this book. You really have to get past the first one hundred pages before it gets interesting. Plus I thought the ending was a bit anti climatic. But I still think that anyone who is remotely interest should give it a chance. Lisbeth is totally bad ass and Blomkvist is a bit of a slut. Very interesting mystery.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I was captured by The Hunger Games just by reading the first page. I didn't really expect Catching Fire to be as good as The Hunger Games because sequels have a tendency to lose steam after the first book.  But I really loved Catching Fire.  There were no lags.  Every chapter kept you on your toes. Good character development.  Definately worth 5 stars.  Can't wait for the movie.

B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|I didn't expect The Hobbit to be as good as The Lord Of The Rings trilogy and its not. BUT it is a very good movie.  I am anxious to see the rest of the trilogy.  I haven't read the book yet but I am intrigued so that is next on my list (after I finish A Dance With Dragons)  I plan to buy this movie after the entire trilogy is released.  But if you can't wait, don't be afraid to buy it now.  I love watching a younger Bilbo.

B00AB0Z88S|3.0|I watched this movie last night with my family.  Very slow start but i stayed awake and watched the whole movie.  If I don't like a movie I will usually fall asleep during it.  The movie reminds me of Castaway but I enjoyed Castaway more.  I wouldn't buy it as I don't think I would want to watch it over and over but it's ok to see one time.  My advice...rent it from Redbox.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie was highly acclaimed by critics and audiences. I agree! It's well written, it's exciting, it's incredible how special effects are used in this film. And, it's the culmination of so many other good movies (Thor, Captain America, Hulk, etc.). To be able to see it in 1080P 3D at home with the speakers & sub cranked up is quite a treat!
B0063IH60K|2.0|It's OK. I prefer free cell.  don't know if I will keep it. just trying it out for now, so to speak.

0307476073|5.0|\\"Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail\\" (2012 release; 317 pages) brings the by-now familiar story of how author Cheryl Wilde in her mid-twenties (the story takes place in 1995), tired of herself and of the direction in her life (or the lack thereof), decides almost on a whim to hike the Pacific Crest Trail from the Mojave Desert in southern Cailfornia up north into Oregon (eventually changing plans to cross all of Oregon into Washington). With little or no background in backpacking or long-distance hiking, Strayed (a new last name she chose pretty much out of thin air when she divorced shortly before starting the PCT journey, but of course the meaning of the word was not lost on the author) quickly discovers how ill-prepared she is for this epic journey, not only from an equipment perspective, but also from a physical and mental perspective. But perservere she did, regardless.<br /><br />Couple of comments: first and foremost, this is one of the VERY BEST books I have read in a long time, and I do mean: in many years. The books reminds me somehow of Jon Krakauer's \\"Into Thin Air\\" from the late 90s. Early on in the book, Strayed observes: \\"I'd ranged and roamed and railed--from Minnesota to New York to Oregon and all across the West--until at last I found myself, bootless, in the summer of 1995, not so much loose in the world as bound to it.\\" The author manages to interweave her journey on the PCT with flashbacks from the past on how she got to where she is (her mother's death, her father's brutality, etc.) and it makes for riveting reading. I can honestly say that I did not want the book to end, in the same way that Strayed did not want the hike to end. But then of course it does, and so did the book.<br /><br />One thing that is not made clear at any point is why Strayed waited so long (the book was pubished more than 16 years after she hiked the PCT). I'm curious about that. At the same time, it is amazing how many details Strayed is able to bring, given the lapsed time since then. This book just screams to be made into a movie and I read somewhere that Reece Whitherspoon is likely to take on the role of Strayed. Say it ain't so! Naomi Watts, where are you? Meanwhile, I don't know why it's taking me so long to finally read this book, but better late than never, I suppose \\"Wild\\" is a MUST-READ book, period.given the lapsed time since then.

B007AL48UK|2.0|It was okay but I prefer games that aren't so long. It doesn't seem like this version has many shorter games. I didn't care for two sailboat games; the second one was simply longer. The layouts were not all that interesting. Spring Mahjongg is much better

0143121316|5.0|A book by someone that knew the major players in China intimately and who helped shape U.S. policy for four decades is going to be good - and Kissinger delivers. His masterful grasp of public policy and international relations comes though in the book; however, I wish he would have delved more into what Nixon, the consummate politician; goals were for Chinese relations if he had stayed in office. Overall a very good book.
B00BI745AA|4.0|Hugh Jackman is fantastic; Anne Hathaway so so...I don't know how she got the Oscar.  I never saw the play, but the production and direction were both excellent.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This movie starts a little slow to build the story but once it does it will suck you in with both its visual beauty and powerful story line. I felt it ended a little oddly but other then that a great movie. Some spots might be a little tough to watch for younger children (animal death) but all in all a great family movie.
6305127646|5.0|I've gone through two viewings in the theatre, one via Pay-Per-View, one rental, two purchased VHS tapes and the soundtrack.  This, to me, was the pinnacle of Val Kilmer's career; I wish they'd made additional installments as a franchise-type of film.  All of his disguises and dialects were superb; the love story between Simon Templar and Dr. Emma Russell, to this day, leaves me breathless.  I cannot stop thinking about this movie and cannot stand the critics who seem to have had it in for Val Kilmer throughout his entire career.  Mr. Kilmer is obviously brilliant and that is off-putting to those who have no talent other than to have a spot somewhere to lambaste talented performers which comes across as scathing hatred for a man who's never hurt anybody and who has spent many years giving his time and money and efforts for Native Americans and other charities.  That aside, I loved Val as Batman and he was blasted for that portrayal, too.  The Saint remains his best film in my eyes; it remains as fresh today as when I'd originally viewed it in the theatre.  Very enjoyable and believable.
B00BWYX2MG|5.0|I ride my motorcycle with my iPhone mounted up front. I wanted to be able to use Google maps and Pandora without having to take my gloves off, and AnyGlove seemed like a great solution.<br /><br /> I tried the original formula, and it worked okay but seemed to not be just right. Customer service had followed up on my original order, and I had described my problem. Without my asking, the decided to send me a bottle of the AnyGlove for Leather and emphasized using a hair dryer instead of air drying.<br /><br />Following their directions and trying out the new product, and my gloves worked on my iPhone just like I wasn't wearing them! I then tried it on my winter gloves with the same result. The stuff really works and is a must have product for anyone who rides motorcycles and had an Android or iOS device.<br /><br />It's rare to find a niche product that works well with such a great company standing behind it! Highly, highly recommended!
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|It was ok. I like  his other books better .  But the part I did like is  when Manny takes all the heat
B00081U7HC|3.0|Not to be redundant, but I agree with so many of the previous reviews.  When this movie was released in theaters, it had talented actors, a great writer, a wonderful director and brilliant editors.  This edition trashes the work of those editors by adding in superfluous scenes.  Those scenes were taken out for a reason - they served NO purpose to the story and they dragged the pace down.  I had the theatrical version on VHS at one time, now I need to see if I can find it on DVD because I hate this version of this great movie.

B00BB8RKH6|3.0|It started out with a lot going on and I thought that it was going to be a really good movie.  I love anything that Denzel Washington is in.  However, about 1 hour through the movie, it began to fade and just drug out going nowhere until the end.
B007V4530A|4.0|Simply a book about sharing a story. Critically important in life and this book covers the basics...well. It offers clear and simple advice on how to present better. Worth reading for the beginner or the experienced presenter. I plan to use the material as soon as possible.
B00B23O96A|5.0|I found this to be a lovely retrospect of the music Eric heard as a child as well as a 'tipping of the hat' to the genre.  The album title says it all.
B0098466CK|5.0|This album was of great quality all the way through, not a bum in the lot. The band's musical technicallity has steadily impoved without losing any of it's sword and sorcery intensity. The songs are precise and to the point (or short and sweet if you prefer) and left this listener wanting to hear it again and again. In fact everyone I know who has heard my copy has ran out and purchased it ASAP, a sign of a true master piece or perhaps a mass charm spell? I am not positve yet, but I highly recommend it! Vance Lives!
B0073XORCY|4.0|Listened to TAAB2 quite a few times and while I think its brilliant, there is something missing. Couldn't help thinking 'What if, and what might have been' if Barrie Barlow was on drums. There are parts in these songs that definitely need double bass drumming. That's the 'something' that is missing. Otherwise, a good album.
B00BESLHEA|2.0|This movie had a pretty good cast (Crowe, Liu) and pretty good production values (sets, costumes) but was ultimately disappointing.<br />Dialogue was average and the fight scenes were poor - even the final fights didnt give a sense of being \\"epic showdowns\\" instead they came off as brief and a bit easy.<br />I have to admit I'm surprised by the number of positive reviews, but that is probably because you also get the sense that this movie could have been a great movie if more time had been spent on fight planning and choreography. It does have the feel of a 70's movie but it would have been a bad one.<br /><br />A good attempt by RZA (2 stars instead of 1) but falls short.

B008Y7N7JW|3.0|You have to be able to get past the premise to enjoy the movie. I felt as if the movie was written by a ten year old kid.
B0055PGUYU|2.0|I gave up after reading less than half of this book. That is something I rarely do with any book, especially nonfiction books. But frankly, I got tired of the author's prolix style of reporting. I was expecting a general treatment of the neuroscience behind habit formation in humans. I knew the book also dealt with how businesses use advertising psychology to create buying habits in consumers, and how large-scale cultural habits are created, but I was not as interested in these other aspects of the issue. I was disappointed to find after covering a little over a quarter of the book, that I'd read the lion's share of what the author had to say on the topic of individual habit formation and change in humans. I kept reading thinking that surely there must be more. But the author seemed to be more interested in teaching us about how advertising psychology works to form consumer habits.<br /><br />On a whim, I searched the Internet for \\"summary power of habit\\" and, amazingly, got exactly that: a very long and detailed chapter-by-chapter summary of this book. If printed out, that summary would have been more than 20 pages. I read the whole thing and I was grateful for the time it saved me. I had no further desire to finish the book.<br /><br />I went to Amazon and looked at the reviews to see if there were others who shared my viewpoint and, indeed, there were. I agree with many other reviewers that this book is too long. On the other hand, I understand that there are many readers who will no doubt truly enjoy the author's casual conversational style. For them, I suspect it was entertaining; to me, it was frustrating. I was impatient and wanted to get to the heart of the findings. I didn't want to have to wade through lots of light stories concerning this issue, stories that seemed more common sense than astute scientific knowledge. By comparison, the pithy scientific findings seemed scarce.<br /><br />This is one case where I should have examined the Amazon reviews closer before I purchased the book. Instead, I was won over by a glowing review from a newspaper and made a quick, one-click choice. Live and learn!r before I purchased the book.

B008035H16|4.0|My comment is to NOT read this book in the Kindle version!!  It is written in a cartoon format and you CANNOT adjust the font size.  I literally read the entire book using a magnifying glass.  Even with that, the particular font style used was not always easy to decipher.  Needless to say, this overshadowed my enjoyment of the book.  It is an uplifting story though and lets you realize anyone can create their own happiness.

B00C7TAF3Y|2.0|Reading the other reviews, it's clear that I'm the only one not drinking the koolaid! I must not be as smart as I believed I was because I found it to be frustrating and difficult.

B0083SBMBM|5.0|OMG this movie is AWESOME!!! Captain America, Thor, The Hulk, Iron Man and the master assassins Black Widow and Hawkeye are all together in one awesome movie.  Let's not forget Loki as the villain.  All the performances were spectacular and the action scenes were great (it wouldn't be such a fun movie if they weren't).  The special effects and the story were great too.  If you like superheroes and action movies, then this is definitley your cup of tea.

B009GEYX5E|2.0|So I was really excited and bought this for my SX70 oneshot polaroid, and this film i purchased turned out to be blue at first, which was probably processing; but then everything went green and yellow and fade into a mess of yellow blurry figures. I was shocked and did a series of test shots, YES 8 of THEM and everything turned out awful and yellow..... Duh how could i ask for a refund? I've already used ALL of them. I hate this.... :(
B0011Z31V8|5.0|Got this as a $3 download.  Very happy with it.  I recommend jumping on Amazon's MP3 cheap downloads when you can!
B009G41CG2|5.0|Mahjong is another favorite.  It is a game that can be played anytime, anywhere.  Always a tad challenging but always entertaining.
B000YHG72E|3.0|The DVD case was in several pieces when it arrived.  I expected the DVD to be in pieces as well, but it wasn't.  I haven't put it in the DVR yet - we'll see.<br /><br />This is a great movie with unforgettable one-liners.  It isn't rocket science, but.....
B00991TCOG|5.0|I just recently discovered Lindsey and immediately love her music and videos.  She is very talented and it's a nice change from the traditional instrumental-type CD's out there.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This is a great game and very interesting however once you get into the upper levels, it is frustrating to work so hard to get rewards. They make it impossible to not buy something if you want to get ahead in the game. I have learned tips from forums thank goodness. In the higher levels the treasure chest can be unfair at times and some of the guest fish are unpractical to feed (Blue lion fish at 15,000 algae, come on!). In the upper levels you do not get as much interaction with Nemo so you end up spending your time harvesting and planting mystery seeds. Gets boring at times. However on the whole is it enjoyable and addicting. Hope the programmers see the light. I have read other gamers that share the same situation. We need more interaction and goals to help us stay interested.
0307474259|5.0|I got my self on ''track'' and quickly shed 15 lbs. in 3 weeks after reading the book. I had been on the Atkins diet as a younger man and it worked, but I had a hard time passing up the ''CARBS''  DISGUISED AS WHOLE GRAIN BREADS AND PASTA. Once you get your insulin level to moderate your desire for more food decreases.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|Lincoln is our cultural icon of leadership and wisdom in the face of the horrifying evil of human slavery, and the unspeakable suffering of a bloody war dividing family and nation.  This movie not only brings the story of the political courage it took to pass an Amendment to the Constitution, but the also the real world compromises that were made.  It is an awesome movie that everyone who loves freedom should see, and ponder.
B0097A2LTW|5.0|so realistic i loved it, it was like i was actualy there. thank you. keep up the good work. by.
B002C949AE|3.0|Adventurous, daring and strong is the personality that is being portrayed in this story. Loved the description of her childhood and her path of self discovery until becoming a UN ambassador
B00BETX5PS|5.0|..this tougher less compliant Daniel Craig &#34;Bond&#34; is worth his weight in Gold. Xavier is a great villain. watch it
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout for me.  And I love that it is only just over 20 minutes, but it works you hard.  There are 3 levels of workout - so you can adjust it to your needs and mix things up once you get going.  I find Jillian to be motivating and encouraging.  And I feel stronger and have more energy since I have started doing this workout.  Great purchase!!
B008WCP2KG|5.0|I bought this movie for my wife on our anniversary.  The movie itself was fun to watch, I would rate it slightly higher than average.  Matthew McCounaghey's character is hilarious.  The best part of this movie, however, is what it does to women.  If you are a man, get over your insecurities and BUY YOUR WOMAN THIS FILM.  You'll thank me and you'll thank the director and writer.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I REALY like this game because it reminds me of skyrim. And mostly DC Universe. So if u guys are a fan of those games, then u will probably like this game to.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really love this app because I can easily move around and collect coins. I rate this app 4 stars out of 5.
B00CATSONE|4.0|It is written like a high school paper, but provides and knowledgeable understanding that's entertaining. I enjoyed it, quick read
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|i was bored i tried it after 10 minutes i succeeededin being frustrated by bad aim.<br />and became mad at the stupid birds
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Very entertaining. Found it interesting how the Gospel of Jesus dying for the sins of man was made so plain in this secular film. It was a film of courage and faith.
B008KEQMDC|3.0|Similar to &#34;He's Just Not That Into You&#34;, this movie was based on a self-help book.  It was, however, a disappointment.  There were parts in the movie that were meant to be funny, but just fell flat.  Also, a lot of the characters were really annoying (like the Cameron Diaz character).  In any case, it wasn't terrible, but I wouldn't watch it again.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is so cool! And addicting! But, I think there should be a redstone update soon. But otherwise, I love this game and think it is the best game for the moble devises!
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|Great movie<br />My grandchildren watch this movie over and over, never tiring of the story!  Adults love it as well
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|such a classec cute movie will watch over and over agaim. so funny to i love the tiny people with the rat hats
0525478817|5.0|I just bought this book and this morning and finished it about 20 minutes ago. I'm not usually and emotional person or a crier (hoped I spelled that right lol!), but this book had me in tears. I'm still trying to get over it. I was beautifully written and the emotion was so raw and real. I'm not going to say too much more so I don't start crying again:)
B0025UHKNS|1.0|Ordered this watch and was excited to see that it arrived early, but when opening the product was very disappointed. It came in good condition but had missing accessories, and additional accessories that weren't usable. Not to mention it only had instructions for the older version of this watch which was not useful either. ...Sending it back.
6305736650|5.0|**This review is for the regular snap case DVD version**<br /><br />This is my favorite film of all time - it represents everything that was great about movies in the 40's, 50's, and 60's.  There's romance, espionage, mystery, and of course, the song.  The characters are well developed, flawed (in a very good way), and the story isn't spoon-fed to the viewer like most modern movies.  In fact, the film is but a snippet of a complete story, and the viewer is left to decide what happens to the protagonists and the leader of the rebellion.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this gem, stop what you're doing and watch it!
B0086449YA|5.0|I've been a fan of Mark Knopfler fan since Dire Straits first came to America.  This album is the latest in his awesomness!
0007466064|5.0|Was so nice to get back to the characters I really loved from the first three books, and Martin did so with excellence.
B00BHU9DUK|1.0|i couldnt even finish this movie it was horable. boring. annoying. she needs to eat some food she looks like she is going to die
B00CA9Y6Q8|4.0|I am so impressed with Laura Mvula's album.  It was a recommendation from my Facebook page. She has a strong and sultry voice.  I love the musical arrangements. It's a CD that I continue to play over and over and each time I listen I hear something that I missed before. Her voice has so much raw emotion, but her lyrics represent everyday life.
0767817664|5.0|I still remember the very day I went BY MYSELF to the movie theater to watch it!!! It blew my mind, great story, great direction, great cast, and excellent special effects too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002DQLGHU|4.0|My kids are reading the Harry Potter book series and are enjoying them thoroughly.  The movie is good but not as good as the book.  Would recommend it to other families to view for pure family entertainment.
B008VBYN80|4.0|This is a fun game , however at about level 11 my game froze up (a common problem on the kindle fire) and I know have over 1.75 billion diamonds. This would be awesome except I can no longer access any of the in-game friend options which really sucks.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|i am not a daft punk fan boy. but i respect. and hell yes this song is great. i love funky stuff. its what electronic music is for. please let this song be the start of the end of dubstep.
B009Z5975A|5.0|2 good movies for the pirce of one!!! and i say 2 because the 2nd gremlins blah. but so worth it for the others
B00BWJARHO|3.0|The main character just wasn't as good as the one in LOR. Also, the other characters just didn't have the time to build their characters, so there wasn't much &#34;connection&#34; --but it was good enough to watch the whole thing! :)
B008P9M614|5.0|I really loved this show on TV and I never got around to finishing it so when I found this I had to have it! It was the perfect price and worth every penny!
B007KZY1YY|5.0|very good sequence had me hooked could not stop reading. my family complained that I was only reading and forgetting other duties but this series really kept my interest for long periods. Author knew how to explained in detail and I am waiting the movie to see if it will really captured the mood of the books.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|All ways fun never give up on the game run away from the police and don't get hit by the train
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Great story, unique angle on a historical event. Very bloody (as to be expected). The cast was great, amazing cinematography.
B000QI2ZWW|4.0|Fun movie that my grandson and I enjoyed together. A movie that can be enjoyed by everyone in the family.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|My whole family is enjoying this show SO much, and we're hoping they keep it around--oh, and Ragnar is HOT! :)
1451695195|5.0|How wonderful that Alexander was able to remember his experience and share it will all of us.  Because he's a neurosurgeon, it makes him more knowledgeable than many of us, and he was able to describe what happened after he died, so we could understand it and, hopefully, relate to it.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|There was a lot of violence. I was disappointed by the depth of the story line. It was a little too violent for my taste.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|Clutch have been my favorite band since their first album. I've enjoyed their foray into a blues-ier, slower sound with the last two albums (From Beale Street to Oblivion and Strange Cousins From The West) but I have to say their return to a heavy rock outfit made me smile from ear to ear. This album has more in common with Blast Tyrant and Robot Hive/Exodus than recent releases so if your want your face rocked off with pure no nonsense rock and roll you can't go wrong here.
B005LAII08|5.0|This movie has become one of very favorites. They really did a good job with this. This is a movie the whole family can enjoy.
B00BF123WG|1.0|Lots of torture interrogation scenes that went nowhere. Some terrorist attacks for action. Then the final raid that was too dark to see much. Yes, it was at night, but Hollywood has been representing night in visible ways for decades.<br /><br />I'm surprised that there has been controversy about this film's accuracy. It looked pure Hollywood to me.
B003TH14H4|5.0|Great show and I enjoy having it on my video library so that I can watch it from any computer.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved reading the book and couldn't wait to find out what happened next.  A good read but didn't like the ending at all.
B000MGATTE|5.0|Loved it!!  I am wondering why I had not read it sooner!!!  It is interesting, and keeps suspense up, how is Lisey going to save herself!!??
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Really a good romp.  Couldn't figure hoe this character was going to come out if his situation.  All in all just a very good read.  His books are always good, but this is one of my favorites.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Awesome movie - very well directed - keeps you riveted to your seat - We recommend it for everyone. Ben Affleck is terrific.
B000SEGHT6|4.0|I didn't know much about this book, other than it was often described as an American classic, before I read it. I think that was for the best.<br /><br />It would be difficult to synopsize Slaughterhouse-Five and do it justice. It uses a narrative structure that was probably quite startling when it was first published, and it defies categorization because it alternates between different genres (semi-autobiographical novel, science fiction, fantasy, historical fiction, etc.).<br /><br />I haven't read any other work by Vonnegut, so I don't know if this is typical of his style. There were aspects of the writing (some other reviewers have mentioned the repetition of particular phrases, for example) that were irksome. On the other hand, the book was compelling and short, and I actually finished it pretty quickly. It's definitely worth a read, but I think you'd enjoy it more if you approach it with an open mind as well as some knowledge of the historical context.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|I bought this product primarily for the digital copy and when I went to go redeem the code it said that it was unable to.  Should have just bought it on itunes.
B00BJS7LHC|1.0|Quentin Tarantino needs someone to tell him \\"no\\". This movie dragged out a 90 minute story to the point of boredom. The characters are over-the-top, and not in a good way; they talk too much and they have nothing interesting to say. Tarantino is a one-trick pony and he seems to have run out of ideas. The entire sequence with Don Johnson was utterly ridiculous, and I do not understand why Jonah Hill even gets works in this town. He's a terrible actor.<br /><br />Save your money and rent it, but only if you're interested in violence for violence sake.
0380730405|5.0|Love this book.  I have read it several times in my life.  Very sorry that I could not get it on a kindle version.
B0019N95IK|5.0|star trek enterprise, was, is a great show. even though its before kirk and spock. scott bakula is great as captain jonathan archer. the show should  have been renewed for season 5, season 4 was the best season. season 3 was ok, season 2 was good and season 1 was great. i miss this show and should be brought back to televison. :) this fan is very pleased.
B008IBP24C|5.0|This is my new favorite series...I didn't think i would like it after the first few minutes but I continued watching and now I'm hooked.  Would definitely recommend!!
B0070UFMOW|5.0|Coupled with the E9K, this brought my headphone setup (Sennheiser 598) to a whole new level.  Sounds incredible, and love the features and DAC quality.<br /><br />Even beats my Cambridge DACMagic and Cambridge 840A Amplifier in terms of sound quality with cans.
B001BANK32|4.0|Oldie but a goodie. King is one of my favorite authors of all time. The scene with the hedge animals will always cause chills for me. I believe that was the first scene from a book that actually scared me while reading it.
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|Recommended for all Rebus fans as he makes a strong comeback. Rankin also, as usual, paints a beautiful picture of Scotland.
1476734941|1.0|wish I could get my money back.  I expected a diet book not a lot of stories from people's experience.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I started playing this room not that long ago and have become addicted! I try to play every day multiple times. Must have game for everyone.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|The movie was interesting and had a positive message- hard work and confidence in yourself will help you overcome any difficulties that may arise. Us adults also liked the move..
B002V6RB1C|5.0|Excellent plot--definitely a classic.  Recommend to anyone who enjoys a good movie but especially to the people who work with the baby boomer generation (and don't always understand their jokes/quotes)!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have all three seasons,The best show on t.v. ,cant wait for season four.would definitely recommend to a friend,if everyone I know didn't already watch the show.
B005J4TLQG|4.0|I saw the preview to this movie while watching another movie and it looked interesting.  I love English comedies so I purchased it.  Not really expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Here you have the South England version of E.T. meets The Goonies, but the kids here are street thugs and the aliens are eating people indiscriminately.  Overall it was a fun watch. Just trying to decipher the kids' cockney/south end jargon is a treat in itself. The story opens on a gang of street kids accosting a woman on her way back to her flat. First impression is that these kids are mindless ghetto rats, but they grow on you quickly when a meteorite smashes into the car next to them during the robbery and their leader Moses goes to investigate.  He is attacked by something in the car and the group chases the creature to a shed (ala E.T.) where they dispatch it and proceed to carry it around. It's an alien of course, and after that the adventure begins when a whole slew of gorilla/wolf mother****ers as well as a crazed drug dealer and plenty of armed police coming after them. Dark and gruesome at times.  Touching here and there. Funny at others.  In the end you will have found yourself having a good time watching it.  From the makers of Shaun Of The Dead, if that mean anything to you.  Definitely worth a peek, but you had better bring your cockney dictionary ,because they don't slow down the dialogue for one second.<br /><br />Dig it!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|He is all murmurred out. I for one though enjoy a well plotted story with sexual content. I may yet finish that Fifty Shades Darker but have moved on over to read dime store detective thrillers and re-cycled books out of dupsters as an alternative to the chect clenching heavy weighed subconscious diva drivel that that story has become. I know the next half may hold surprises in store, but for now Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey (or is it Gray), well, for now I couldn't care less.<br /><br />On a positive not E.L. James writes a descriptive narative with some skill. Congratulations to her for getting her finger on the pulse of what readers will buy. Now, IF she will stay away from the redundant murmurring and make the characters a little more &#34;real&#34;, it could, ahg, forget about it. I bought it, I'll read it and it will sit for a while before I finish it because my reading time is more valuable to me than that story will satisfy. Yes I did buy and finish Fifty Shades of Grey (or is it Gray?)
B008602KQI|4.0|I thought the director did a good job bringing the book to life, however, the book is always better. Can't wait for the sequel. It's definitely worth reading the books before seeing the movie.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Either you are fan of The Walking Dead or you are not....  better than Season Three (common, isn't the prision just a bit too dreary).  Season Two is where we add many prominant characters and really get to know their personalities...  a must have for true fans!
B003DXSXCI|4.0|An action movie with a decent plot.  It's not a modern movie by any means, but certainly worth at least one viewing.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Definitely get the 6 person expansion! Plenty of expansions available to add even more depth.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W7JWYG?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393177&creativeASIN=B000W7JWYG&linkCode=shr&tag=bryvaneng-20&=toys-and-games&qid=1366646733&sr=1-2&keywords=settlers+of+catan<br /><br />Or buy them both at once to save $$<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005BM07P0?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393185&creativeASIN=B005BM07P0&linkCode=shr&tag=bryvaneng-20&=toys-and-games&qid=1366646733&sr=1-3&keywords=settlers+of+catan
B003Y5H5C4|4.0|30 Minutes Or Less is one of those crude Danny McBride/Nick Swardson/Ariz Ansari flicks that you have come to expect in the last few years.  Full of graphic conversations and hillbilly, white trash humor that would be more at home in a Roadhouse than in your living room.  There are strippers, and hitmen and pot-smoking slackers. Plenty of juvenile low-brow cracks and punchlines.  Having said all that, I think that's really why we go to see movies like Borat, and Knocked Up, and Pineapple Express or any of the Harold & Kumar movies.  Because they're just so stupid and crude and raucous that we can release ourselves for an hour and a half and laugh ourselves silly.  This is just pure comedy, plain and simple.  Along the lines of Grandma's Boy or Happy Gilmore.  The storyline is this, Nick (Jesse Eisenberg)is a slacker pizza delivery boy who winds up getting kidnapped by a couple of idiot criminal masterminds (McBride/Swardson) who decide to make him rob a bank so they can score $100,000 to pay a hitman to off one of their fathers. Follow? So they strap a bomb to Nick and set him free, demanding that he bring back the cash or they will blow him up.  Let the madness begin.  What follows is hilarious and inventive and so stupid that it's actually quite clever.  You will laugh.  I did.  Overall, 30 Minutes Or less was definitely worth a watch or two or three.  I'm sure I missed a few things.  But with that crew of actors, how can you go completely wrong?<br /><br />Dig it!
0345803507|5.0|I loved the whole trilogy and recommend it to everyone.  This is the best book series I have ever read.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|drags on, like a zombie<br />someday someone will put it out of its misery<br />not enough action for my taste
B00B49L7JY|4.0|Incredible story of a rock superstar who never wanted fame. But what if a whole nation wants to know you better as the man who wrote the soundtrack to their freedom movement?
B009KS4XRO|5.0|By far the best Bingo game on the market! Can't get enough of it. Very challenging to master all of the cities!
B00AA0TZTW|3.0|I do not personally know Jimi - But - the Jimi I knew would never have released this as a studio album - NEVER!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This unique story keeps your interest to the last page.  It is descriptive, humorous and poignant all at the same time.  I could be laughing one moment and tears welling in the next.  This is a wonderful story of the lengths people will go to rid their lives of pain and loneliness.  It is not long but it is lovely.
B005ILWOZA|5.0|this is a great 2nd cd...it had to grow on me at first but once i started listening more i became addicted to it!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Maybe it's because I am an introvert, but I loved this book.  It was so validating to know all the years people have been telling me that I am &#34;too sensitive,&#34; that this is not a failing but a character trait of an introvert.  In our extrovert-focused society, how good to see it in print that introverts have a valued place and positive characteristics to offer society as well.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|What a great movie to watch! Enjoyed it much !!! I really like this movie a lot! The graphic, story, music, vision effects, animals! All great!!
B009JBWOU0|5.0|This was so worth it. I am a huge Batman fan and already owned the first two, but this one gave me the opportunity to have them all in a complete set. Plus, the price was right! :)
B007TK77QE|4.0|Grunge and gloom is the predominant mood of this book. I would have liked to give it 3.5 stars for its between OK and quite enjoyable but not a great book, with the JK Rowling straining the bounds of credibility at times. This community has problems. Almost all of them are either abused or in unhappy marriages or neurotic. Those that are not are self satisfied prigs. Not a nice community! But it does just about succeed in keeping one's attention and giving the reader a desire to know what happens next, which is the art of a good storyteller. Worth a read but don't expect too much.
B0074VA2T2|4.0|My 2 year old daughter loves this app it makes her giggle and I love that sound. It is her favorite book at the moment and she loves that she get to &#34;eat&#34; all the fruits.
0345803493|5.0|hands down the best set of books i have ever read in my life.  i wish e.l. james would come out with more.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Max Brooks does a great job of blending political intrigue, history, and zombies.  I would recommend this book to anybody who is interested in zombies, world history or just likes a good story.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|wanted to get something so i wouldn't beat my keyboard to death, had the n52 and the cyborg command unit but i like this one better
B00B7IJBUY|4.0|The new record was above expectations,really enjoyed it, Bon Jovi as good as he can be!Thank you!.Looking forward to his concerts in Europe.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|The game is all that and a bag of chips but when you get to level 99 it stops boring y not keep going you know how much it took to get to this level and you take the joy and money and just stop not so kool I DON'T want to start over SO level should not be stop very addictive but feels like working for nothing
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Les Mis is a wonderful story and the music is unbelievable.  The quality of the DVD is exceptional and the sound is great.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Just what I was looking for.  Works great on my Kindle Fire.  Love the floating dimmable clock and the choice of sounds for the alarm.  Easy to use.  Some of the sounds I really like.  Others are too high pitched:  tinny or jarring.  But otherwise it's great.  The rain &amp; stream &amp; ocean &amp; frogs are all very nice.  I understand I can download more for free but haven't done that yet.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|Loved it, can't wait to see the others in this trilogy (yes, another trilogy). Great visual effects, just the right amount of sappy happiness and fear, and interesting if two-dimensional characters.
B0061PEAUY|1.0|If your reading this book because you like the T.V. show bones then you will be very disappointed. It is nothing like the T.V. show yes some of the character names are the same but that is as far as it goes. Without considering the show it is a boring book. I had a very hard time reading it because it was so boring. Do not recommend.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Had been wanting to see season  1.  Just got the kindle fire and am a PRIME member.  Was great to see this very good show for free and with a perfect picture and sound?  You ROCK, AMAZON
B0041D843M|5.0|Excellent book.<br />The best on nutrition so far.<br />Facts and reports based on long term researches and experiments.<br />Admire courage of writers to expose truth without fear and discrimation.<br />Recommend it as &#34;must read!&#34;
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This was a good movie, so goodwe watches to twice. As always Jamie Foxx showed what a versatile and talented actor he is.
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|I found this book very interesting.  It was just a little before my time, but WWII was going on wh  I was a child.  I grew up with the idea that the nation was strongly behind the war and those involved.  This book presented a propaganda-free view of the events.  It was also interesting to see that not a lot has changed down there.
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|I saw the movie Something Borrowed & wanted to follow the characters on their journey. This book fit the bill. It was very entertaining.
B008476HBM|5.0|I have read this classic many time;  I reread it almost every month.  If I have a time when I have no new books to read then I turn to my old faithful and I find something new in it every time.  It is my security blanket I think.  So beautifully written and such a sly, tongue in cheek sense of humour, I laugh out loud all the time.  Very relevant even today.  Peoples characters never really change and this is such a study of certain types of people, it is educational in a sense;  as the essense of the characters are all around us in this world.  All her books are enjoyable, but this is my secret vice.<br /><br />If only I could write with this sensitivity I would be so happy.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Watched all three seasons in 2 weekends..........addictive in a good way, but no housework got done!  Glad my curiosity got the best of me.
B005GIS1WA|4.0|Really funny!!! My brothers and I both enjoyed this movie very much! This is a good movie for the whole family!

B006KP3XCQ|1.0|Although I am a HUGE fan of animation, I found this movie to be S-L-O-W and annoying.  Cute premise, but the delivery was, in my opinion, terrible.  I can't imagine a child sitting through this thing, much less an adult.  My friends love it; I couldn't stand it.

B00BEZTMFY|4.0|It is a normal DVD, so doesn't have the special filming features that require special glasses and can even drive peoples eyes nuts when trying to watch it in theatres. It was an enjoyable film, though you do have to wait two more years to see the ending.

B0053O89KG|5.0|The best cop show on television.  A bit too much gore for me, but not nearly as much as other shows.  I love the humor and the character development.  It never fails to entertain.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Any fan of war or suspense fims should enjoy this movie. So glad to own it. Highly Recommend Zero Dark Thirty.
B0063GORYU|4.0|this is an easy game which even someone who does not play a lot of games can win often enough that you get hooked. its easy to pick up while you are waiting in doctor's offices or for the bus yet challenging enough that it doesn't get boring.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I love Tina Fey. This read was quick, funny (as expected), and enjoyable. It is lighthearted and doesn't really ever go past much more than the surface. Although she talks about her personal life, she never really gets too personal. So if you are hoping to get every little juicy detail of her life, you would probably be disappointed. However, if you are looking for a fast and fun read then you should definitely pick this up. If I have any complaints about the book it would be that it was too short. It probably goes without saying that if you are not a fan of hers then you will not be a fan of this book as this is very much her and she never really gets too serious at any point in the book.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|This is such fun :) so rewarding to earn money, it builds up very quickly too. I love to shop and decorate so it appeals to me that way also. Can't get enough of it.
B003R0MF5I|5.0|Was sad to see this series end.  It was something the whole family could appreciate and watch.  None of the blood and guts and gore as in so many tv shows today.  Good character development and nice people.
B005MLP71Y|5.0|A few issues. Males, in the bee world, are Drones. Their only job is to mate. Females run the show. The queen is #1 important. Still some good points about bees and how important they are to our lives.

B002VPE1WK|3.0|I'm giving this a 3 star review, because the bag is really good for the price. The big problem, FOR ME, is that it is NOT BIG ENOUGH!<br /><br />I was led to believe, from one of the video reviews of this bag, that it would be large enough to hold all my stuff. It just was not.<br /><br />Here's what I tried to put into the bag.<br /><br />Canon 7d w 50mm f1.8lens attached<br />18-55mm kit lens<br />55-250mm kit lens<br />70-300 mm lens<br />85mm f1.8 lens<br />480SX Flash<br />Battery recharger<br />various cables and cords that came with the camera<br /><br />If I had stopped there, the bag would have been OK.<br /><br />HOWEVER....I also have<br /><br />Canon XSi Rebel body<br />Sigma 50-200mm lens<br />Canon hfs10 camcorder<br />Canon shotgun mike and wind screen<br />Canon 10X telelens attachment<br />battery charger<br />various cords and cables<br /><br />I could have lived without the Rebel body, but I was really trying to consolidate my camcorder and photo equipment.<br /><br />I also had planned to buy at least one more speed light.<br /><br />So...I guess, all in all, the bag is fine, but if you have a lot of gear, this isn't going to do it.
B00170GYB6|4.0|a fun film, swarzenegger at his normal, in a funny, though childish at times, action film.  I doubt very seriously that it ever won rave reviews in the theaters, but it has elements that make it entertaining and funny for adults, and yet for that pre teen son or daughter who likes action movies, it is clean, mostly bloodless all action.  Oh people get shot, blown up and killed left and right, but you never see a wound, never see blood, see a cartoon cat, and a fat mafia guy passing gas.  Car chases, bullets flying, explosions, and a cute premise
B007R0WHMK|2.0|The movie started out intriquing, then the ending wasted the whole movie for us.  I would not recommend to anyone.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This movie is both fun and interesting! I recommend it as a refreshing and entertaining pastime for any one. Jamie Fox did a great job.
B0064MT1QW|5.0|Excellent transfer of a well made film. Lotsa extras. A most enjoyable David Lean-like epic romance. Terrific value. I highly recommend this.

B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Loved this movie, but then again, having Christian Bale in any movie, you know it's going to be good.  Anne Hathaway as Cat Woman, just added more to this movie!!!  Too bad I missed it at the theater, but hey, it looked good on a 60\\".

B009UNGYHG|5.0|I've been using this for about two months now and it is the best headset that I've used!  It is comfortable, clear and the battery lasts all day.  The case is excellent...provides at least two full recharges so great for when I'm traveling.  It also provides safety for the headset when I toss the device in my suitcase.  The case has a mico usb port which makes charging much easier...allowing me to leave the propitiatory charger for the headset at home and instead use a cable and charger that I already take with me.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Entertaing movie not for children had some good satire in it a. Little bloody  liked the cast good and easy plot to follow
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|If you like conflict, controversy and ugliness - read what passes for \\"news\\" these days. If, on the other hand, you believe in the basic goodness of human beings and want to celebrate the rightness of the spirit - like the majority of viewers - you would enjoy this heart-warming story. What some people think of as \\"silly\\" is to my mind imagination and creativity. Great story, great acting, great heart!

B00A9C3RNQ|5.0|My husband and I are in our 21st year of marriage (to each other, second marriage for us both) so we could identify with some of the situations faced by the characters portrayed by Meryl and Tommy Lee.  It was a nudge to  us since it's easy to become complacent and comfortable after many years.  All the actors portrayed their characters with sensitivity and, perhaps, personal insight.
1476734941|5.0|easy read which is nice for a change when it comes to a &#34;diet&#34; book. simple, to the point  and I appreciated the reviews of those who were included in the book. It was nice to read about real people applying this style of &#34;diet&#34; to real life.  I would recommend this book.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I loved this book. I could hardly put it down. It doesn't try to put everyone in the same category but helps you understand what is most important to you and your spouse and how to better meet each other's needs.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really liked this game a lot. The puzzles are great, then really make you use your<br />brain. The story line is a little cheesy. I am hoping that the sequel is just as good!
B001UG56ES|5.0|GREAT HISTORICAL FILM. Great actors,love story, beautiful scenery. Hugh Jackson was the perfect hero-manly,handsome and romantic. I have always been interested in Australia.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This book is full of mystery, romance and some danger. Sparks paints vivid images of the characters. The story is about a lost love and hope that this true love will have a second chance. It's also about deep loss, grief & regret. Sparks adds an element of danger to keep the reader on edge. Anyone can relate to the different relationships; husband & wife, mother & daughter, mother & son.  I highly recommend this book!
B0037B6QSY|5.0|Highly recommend. Excellent book on mindfulness. Basic enough for beginning meditators, substantial enough to challenge and engage advanced students.  -Tim

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|For those reviewers who complained about the heavy amount of singing in the film:<br /><br />Les Mis is a MUSICAL. In a musical, singing nearly every line of dialogue is NORMAL. Get over it already.<br /><br />I can't even begin to describe just how much I adore Les Mis on the stage (saw it 7 times, once in 1998 with Colm Wilkinson as Jean Valjean-heavenly!), and having read the Norman Denney translation of the 1232-page book, I was chomping at the bit to see the movie. This is the only film besides Titanic that I went to the theater twice, not once, to see. I would have gone three times, but my husband is still trying to resist the urge to hang himself from my tricking him into taking me to see it the second time (Mom took me the first time), as he does not like musicals. So I had to wait for my blu-ray copy.<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />-What the film version delivers that the stage play cannot is: more sophisticated special effects, scenery, and more changes of costume. This was a definite plus.<br />-The live recordings were a great idea-it gave the songs a more natural feel, and the actors didn't have to temper their acting to a time limit.<br />-The acting was amazing, unlike a lot of films of today. I see so much 'wooden' acting these days, and I am sick of it. I am glad that Anne Hathaway (as Fantine) didn't try to make \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" 'sound pretty,' because the tears and emotion she brought to it were unforgettable (I still can't watch it without being moved to tears myself!). I could not imagine anyone else portraying Fantine any better. She is one of the most broken characters in the book, and Hathaway did her real justice. I also thought it more fitting that they put the song in AFTER she became a prostitute. In the stage show, it happens BEFORE (right after she is fired from Valjean's factory), so the song does not get the level of sadness it should. Fantine's descent into suffering is heartbreaking, but through her daughter Cosette, we are given hope.<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br /><br />I will say it-this movie, for the most part did a great job, but it could have been better on some things. Like singing skills for instance. The excellent acting did let me forgive this somewhat, but I still believe they could have found better singers for a few of the roles:<br /><br />Russell Crowe as Javert:  Russell Crowe's voice is not suited to play Javert. I can't quite put my finger on what it is about his voice that rubbed me the wrong way, but it did. But on a positive note, he managed to redeem himself somewhat by portraying Javert's coldness and inner conflict well, and had me in tears when he pinned his own medal on the dead child Gavroche (a nice touch). Javert actually isn't the villain everyone thinks he is-he is a troubled man whose biggest problem is that he has never been taught forgiveness, and that people can change. His biggest flaw is that he tries so hard to do what he thinks is the right thing (capture Valjean because he broke parole), that he often is blinded to what really IS the right thing to do (like letting Valjean be, as he is an upstanding and righteous man). Javert is one of the most complicated people I have ever read about, and I rather like him. I pity him too, as he is shattered when he is finally forced to admit to himself that Jean Valjean is not the piece of vermin he thought he was. Here is an interesting point that always stood out for me: Both Valjean and Javert encounter forgiveness when they really don't deserve it, and they react to it in completely different ways. Valjean is forgiven by the Bishop of Digne for stealing his silver, but he chooses to turn over a new leaf and \\"...become an honest man.\\" Later on, Valjean saves Javert's life and forgives him for hunting him down for the past 20 years, and Javert completely falls apart. \\"...The world I have known is lost in shadow...in granting me my life today, this man has killed me even so.\\"<br /><br />Eddie Redmayne as Marius: Russell Crowe's voice was lacking, but Eddie Redmayne's shaking and vibrating face with every long note he held out was distracting and irritating to watch. I kept having this urge to put his head in a vice so it would stop the shaking. Watch the film-you will see what I mean.<br /><br />-Some of the song lyrics/verses were cut out (probably due to time constraints), most notably the intro to \\"On My Own.\\"<br />-Sometimes, the camera closeups got annoying. I would have liked the camera to pan out once in awhile.<br /><br />For some final words on Les Miserables, it is not a perfect film, but I think it hits pretty close to the mark. The people who worked on it obviously loved what they were doing, and took it seriously, so I can forgive the film's shortcomings. Now that I think about it, I don't think there is a such thing as a perfect film.s Marius: Russell Crowe's voice was lacking, but Eddie Redmayne's shaking and vibrating face with every long note he held out was distracting and irritating to watch.

B005LAIIKI|1.0|Definitely, Taranatino's worst movie to date.  Hokey and absurd in many places.  Ridiculous violence in others.  Come on Quentin, is this supposed to be a comedy or a serious film?  And when are you going to stop putting yourself in your movies?  I hate to break it to you, buddy, but you just can't act and you always bring the film down to a lower level when you're on-screen.  I believe it's gotten to the point where you're believing your own press and feel anything you put out there is going to be accepted as brilliant by your legion of followers....and, unfortunately, based on some of the reviews I have been reading, this still seems to be true.  How sad.<br /><br />P. S.  I didn't include specifics because I didn't want to spoil the film for those still wanting to see it.  Suffice to say, there are way too many holes in this script to be consider anything other than a B-movie by an A screenwriter and director.
0060936223|5.0|WOW!  This bio is up there with The Glass Castle, and Blood, Bones and Butter...an amazing story wonderfully written and all true!  It will have you googling away to do more research on Patti and Robert...I honestly don't think we will ever really have these types of artists/celebs anymore - ordinary people who rise up from really destitute conditions and make their outstanding way into the world.  I feel like celebs now are all birthed from some celeb pod - even the 'reality' stars that end up being famous - they don't seem to come from hardscrabble backgrounds.  I highly recommend this book!

B005G4TJI4|3.0|It is no wonder that many people believe that the moon landings were a hoax after seeing the opening sequence of Transformers: Dark of the Moon.  The film opens with an alternate 1960s where NASA discovers a crash on the dark side of the moon which launched the American space program.  A montage follows that utilizes historical look alikes of John F Kennedy, Richard Nixon and others fused with historical footage.  In the end Apollo 11 discovers a wrecked Autobot spaceship on the moon and a number of cylinders that act as a space bridge.<br />In the present Sam Witwicky (played by the always lackluster Shia LaBeouf) struggles to find employment after arguably saved the world two times.  After receiving a medal from a Barack Obama look alike he meets Carly Spencer, an intern with the British embassy, and  the two hit it off.  Meanwhile, Colonel Lennox (Josh Duhamel) is working with the Autobots, the freedom fighters exiled from Cybertron, to keep the Deceptions, the archenemies of the Autobots, and other earth evils at bay.  During a trip to Chernobyl it is discovered that humanity had not informed the Autobots of all they knew regarding their race.  Interestingly Gary and other Northwest Indiana sites were used to film the Chernobyl scenes (what does that say about Gary and the state of affairs in Indiana?)<br />This leads to an Autobot trip to the moon where they discover the space bridge and the long lost Autobot leader, Sentinel Prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy).  The rest will be left spoiler free.<br />Witwicky's new arm candy, Carly Spencer (Victoria Secret model and industry newcomer Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), replaces Mikaela Banes (played by Megan Fox who was fired after making a statement about Hitler in reference to director Michael Bay's work ethic).  This replacement was given just a slight mention in the film.  However, Huntington-Whiteley's performance is hardly Oscar worthy and not just because she is an inexperienced actress.<br />It is clear from the beginning of the film that she is not supposed to be anything other than a set piece rather than a real contributor to the events.  This is especially noticeable during a scene of excessive action where the camera slows down for what feels like five minutes with her in the foreground walking towards the audience.  Perhaps I'm a Transformers traditionalist but no human on earth would add to the experience.<br />The real reason to see the film isn't the plot that contains more holes than Swiss cheese or the new lady; it is the giant robots battling each other.  On that note the special effects are always top notch as it is a Michael Bay film.  While the effects are often too fast and up close to truly appreciate outside of an IMAX experience, they were good nonetheless.<br />Linkin Park's traditional Transformers song is uncharacteristically slow and rather unnoticeable.  The audio effects often overshadow whatever soundtrack song is trying to set the mood.  This is rather unfortunate as it is probably the best Transformers soundtrack so far.<br />Overall the movie is just decent.  If this was a tale told without giant robots fighting each other it probably wouldn't even garner the score it did.  The story doesn't make any sense and the human characters are forgettable.  It is Optimus Prime, Megatron and company that make this film worthwhile.beginning of the film that she is not supposed to be anything other than a set piece rather than a real contributor to the events.

My only concern with this book is that, although I know it's common usage these days, I don't like the usage of &#34;Me and ________&#34; as the subject of a sentence.  Children hear enough bad grammar.  An author of a children's book should know better, and I'm sure the author of this book does.  It's too bad she probably thought it was &#34;cool&#34; to write it the way she did.
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|It all ended for millions of Harry Potter fans, many dressed in their witchcraft and wizardry outfits, with laughs and tears as J.K. Rowling's life work, that spanned over second novels, eight motion pictures, a theme-park \\"land\\", countless other licensing merchandise, and 14 years (more than half of most of those that are reading this's lives), epically concluded.  This review will remain as spoiler free as possible however if you have not seen at the very least Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 do not read this or see the movie beforehand.  Part 2 wastes no time in starting the story and one would be utterly lost throughout the entire film.<br />Again the movie picks up just minutes after Part 1 ended with Voldemort (brilliantly played by Ralph Fiennes) grave robbing the great Professor Dumbledore's grave for one of the \\"deathly hallows,\\" the omnipotent \\"elder wand.\\"  From there two hours and ten minutes are filled with the heroes Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), his red-headed sidekick Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), Harry's other best friend, Ron's love interest and all around know-it-all Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and the rest of the Order of the Phoenix seeking the destruction of Voldemort's evil ways and defending Hogwarts castle in a showdown for the ages.<br />The real show stealer is Potter MVP Alan Rickman who plays Severus Snape, Harry's long time professor fiend now turned Hogwarts headmaster.  For those that have not read the book again spoilers will be spared but there is an earth shattering revelation about three quarters through the film that showcases Rickman's ability to nail the character of Snape.  If there is ever a reboot of the Potter series, Rickman will be one of the irreplaceable few.  A character that was long despised both in novel and film turns the table on the audience and Rickman gets it every time.<br />While the details will be left spoiler free there is much to be said about the final battle at Hogwarts castle.  Many of the fan favorites, like Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) and Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) return for the latter half of the film.  For longtime Potter-fans  this adds to the \\"realism\\" of the events to come as wizards and witches start to die.  A large problem that the book had (and perhaps it is the lack of visual cues) is the \\"realism\\" of what happens.  Reading that women and children died and seeing it on screen are two entirely different events.  Throughout the final scenes there are bodies of students who had fallen in battle strewn throughout the halls of Hogwarts.<br />The final battle between Harry and Voldemort was a tad anticlimactic but then again so too was it that way in the book.  Credit is given to the film makers for the visual representation of spell casting.  Where sword fights are easily depicted through the back and forth blows the opponents dish out, spell casting was never that way in the book.  Here the film improvises like they always have.  This is especially good in the Molly Weasley (Julie Walters) and Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter) battle.<br />Here is a good time to mention that the differences between the book and the movie are not factored into the review score.  Of course some changes were for the better and some for the worst but it will be left to the audience to decide that for themselves.  This review is on the film alone.<br />It should be mentioned that the film was not just a studio grab for cash in the decision to break the final episode into two.  After seeing the film it is almost impossible for the two films to have been one three hour experience.<br />The special effects are always great in these films as no expense is spared.  For review it was viewed in an IMAX 3D experience.  Where the 3D was not necessarily an addition to the film, the IMAX definitely was.  Some of the wider battle scenes where there is a lot of nuanced action are better viewed in this fashion and the sound is much more clear and crisp.  Thus IMAX is recommended.<br />Just like the special effects, no expense is spared on the audio effects or soundtrack.  The Harry Potter theme that John Williams wrote for the first film does not make a real appearance until halfway through the film but the utilization of previous themes towards the end is brilliantly executed in the way it brings the nostalgia of a 14 year journey to the audience.<br />While the movie was good by Potter standards (not even the best film of the franchise) it fails in a number of categories that Potter fans will surely backlash.  Much of its shortcomings arise from the failures of previous films that this one has built on.  It spends too much time on secondary and tertiary characters that haven't been referenced in some time and has an anticlimactic ending.  Another downfall lies in the film's skimming over new characters.<br />There is no doubt that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 will break box office records but there is much doubt on its road to the Oscars.  It is a good film that everybody who wants to see it probably already has and those that haven't should make sure to read or view the past material before admission.risp.

Sticks that I have to buy Cut the Rope: Time Travel if I want to continue playing Cut the Rope series. I don't know why they couldn't update their previous app's so I don't have to buy another app of the same game that I play. I guess it's a better way for them to get more money.

B0053FANS6|4.0|These films follow in the footsteps of Indiana Jones but with a modern twist.<br /><br />The Mummy (1999) follows Brenden Frasier and Rachel Weisz as a mercenary and archeologist that get wrapped up in uncovering a cursed mummy.<br /><br />The Mummy Returns (2001) follows Frasier and Weisz and their son as the Mummy comes back to enact his revenge.  This film includes Dwayne &#34;The Rock&#34; Johnson as the Scorpion King, an ancient warrior that holds the power to destroy the world.<br /><br />The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008) follows Frasier and Maria Bello (a cast change from Weisz as the same character) and their now much older son as the ancient dragon emperor (Jet Li) is resurrected to bring doom upon the world.<br /><br />These movies are great little adventure films with a PG-13 rating and plenty of comedy.  They could be a bit scary for youngsters but decent films for pre-teens, teenagers and adults alike.  The picture and sound quality of these films are good but improve with each installment.  The only downside, other than the casting change, is that the second disc of special features is not included for any of the three films.<br /><br />I recommend this set.

B004EPYZQ2|4.0|Where to begin this review without spoiling anything?  The movie opens in a small town in Ohio in 1979 with a boy sitting on a swing; he holds a necklace from his hand.  It is winter and there is a gathering at the house adjacent.  Shortly the audience learns that the funeral of this boy's mother.  Joe Lamb's, the boy played by Joel Courtney, mother died in an accident at the mill.<br />The opening scenes are slow and mildly painful as director JJ Abrams' films usually start at a faster pace, however, this choice allows the audience to connect with the characters like Joe or his father, Jackson Lamb played by Kyle Chandler.  It even allows for the audience to meet all of the characters but one.<br />The main section of the story takes place later when the boys begin to shoot their zombie film.  One scene requires them to drive out to a train depot where they enlist the help of the film's lead and underage actress to drive them.  Alice Dainard's, played by Elle Fanning, father is responsible for the accident that killed Joe's mother and naturally leads to confrontation between her father and Joe's.<br />It is at the train depot that a pickup truck drives onto the tracks and derails a locomotive that the action, special effects, and the already stored emotions for the characters come through to the audience.  Of course there is something inside one of the cars that escapes, the Air Force is dispatched to cover it up and strange things start happening throughout the town.  But all of the finer details will be left spoiler free.<br />Abrams does a brilliant job of getting that small town America feel throughout the film.  But his true achievement is attaching the audience to each unique character.  None of the characters step on each other's archetype and they all have their own reasons for being there.  When the situation really starts the hit the fan, the audience has a feels for the characters and the events surrounding them.<br />It should be noted that Elle Fanning's performance is one that is difficult to come by.  Her onscreen presence captivates and is immediately endeared.  She sells every bit of her act.  Even the film within the film is masterfully executed by Fanning.  If she is not nominated for this film, she most certainly will be in the future.<br />This movie should have been reviewed weeks ago.  Upon the initial viewing it was a 5 out of 5, now it is a solid 4.5 out of 5.  The reason behind the reduction is not a reflection on the greatness of Super 8.  As demonstrated from the glowing review above, it is a great movie.  It is just that all other movies this year (or honestly since Inception) have not stimulated the mind in the way that Super 8 does.  The movie is Abrams' best film and a testament to the early days of Spielberg (producer).'s performance is one that is difficult to come by.

This movie depicts a battle between fear and these &#34;guardians&#34; and promotes the view that the greatest danger is children not believing.<br /><br />In spite of being non-religious myself, it's a little disconcerting to see Santa and the Easter Bunny as characters totally divorced from Christmas, Christianity and the religious context for those holidays.
B005AUWXZ0|3.0|One of the increasingly annual summer treats is a usually delightful trip into an imaginary world dreamt by Disney's Pixar Animation Sudios.  Last year's entry, Toy Story 3, was one of two Disney films that grossed over $2 billion (the other being Alice in Wonderland).  This year's Cars 2, while not quite the blockbuster that was the previous year, is currently the reigning box office champion and will surely gross more than its rivals.<br />Cars 2 is a much darker movie than the first which is quite clear from the beginning.  The audience is quickly thrown into the world of Cars espionage with Finn McMissile, voiced by the always great Michael Caine discovering a villainous plot on an oil platform in the middle of the ocean.  While this is the catalyst for the entire film, the gravity of the situation never resonates with an audience.  The choice to use personified trains, planes, and automobiles makes the otherwise very violent events appear to be not so gruesome.<br />2006's Cars arguably stared the young and naïve racecar Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) but this story is clearly that of the rusty, dumb witted tow truck Mater (Larry the Cable Guy).  Their story starts back at Radiator Springs (a once dilapidated relic of Route 66 since restored to former glory by becoming the home of Piston Cup champion McQueen) as McQueen returns home to begin summer adventures with Mater.  Soon Mater lands McQueen in the World Grand Prix, the first ever race of its kind.<br />The race or more its purpose is the most bothersome part of the film.  A billionaire car, Sir Miles Axlerod (Eddie Izzard), who happens to be an SUV turned green car, creates a new type of renewable fuel that will replace gasoline.  All contestants in his race must utilize this fuel.  Of course the villains on the oil platform at the beginning of the film are set against this from happening.  However, the problem is not that the film decided to take a political issue at hand (as they clearly did in 2008's Wall-E); it is that they wavered on the topic.  It is hard to believe that children, or even most adults, will be able to follow the ecological conflict that moves the plot.<br />Overall the film is a fun, thoughtless adventure about friendship with a little bit of politics thrown in.  Thankfully the almost ceaseless action prevents the audience from dissecting the flaws until the lights come up.  The struggle will be reduced by most to the \\"good\\" and the \\"bad.\\"  Or even the \\"haves\\" and the \\"have nots,\\" as the villains are humorously \\"lemons.\\"<br />It is not so much that Cars 2 is a bad movie it is just that Pixar set the bar so high with Toy Story 3 that almost any movie would fall short.  To be honest, it was surprising that the Cars gang even got a second look and would be even more so if they got a third.  Perhaps now with the bar so low next year's entry Brave will have an easier task of impressing its audience.Wall-E); it is that they wavered on the topic.

031603441X|3.0|As the book has been such an enormous success, it's clear that it has some marvelous ingredients that appeal to most people.  For me, the writing style is one of the best elements; it's a great story well told.  There are many interesting details from various parts of Richards' life which only serve to reinforce his image of the coolest man in rock and roll.  Also, he actually takes time to talk about the details of the music: what he liked, how he approached certain songs, how he discovered new techniques along the way.  For a reader who is really interested in the craft of the musician, this book truly delivers, unlike autobiographies by Eric Clapton and Ron Wood.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are some big negatives in the book, the most glaring of which is the completely overdone slagging of Mick Jagger.  Even if you hate the guy, you're still working with him and you dump on him in front of the entire world? For the supposed coolest guy in the world, that is incredibly uncool.  To make it worse, these sections make Richards come off like a cranky old man.  Not cool.  Any reasonable person would have to conclude that some of this nonsense (including the infamous assessment of Jagger's privates) was put in to create a controversy and build up sales.  Great for business but massively uncool.  Ironically, Jagger's response to all of this is the only cool thing about it.<br /><br />Finally, it is painful to read the details about Richards' heroin addiction, and I have to admire his honesty in telling that part of his story.  What is even sadder is hearing about how his young son Marlon was forced to deal with it and essentially be the caregiver to his father.  What an awful thing to put a child through.  Why didn't someone intervene?<br /><br />In any case, this is another example of how the Stones have become as good at marketing as they are at rock and roll.  I still love them, but sometimes you just have to shake your head and think \\"does it really have to go this far?\\"
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This book shows you how the most amazing aren't really amazing because they were &#34;special&#34;, rather a unique series of circumstances just happened to be right for amazing individuals to achieve success.<br /><br />This book also shows you that you don't have to be the &#34;best&#34;. You just have to be &#34;good enough&#34;. The key to success is being in the right place at the right time. For example, how the silicon valley tycoons (i.e. Gates, Jobs) all share very similar backgrounds. They were the right age, they all had uncommon access to computing, they all were in a particular city, they all had &#34;enough&#34; experience in computers, etc.<br /><br />Just read the book it's pretty good regardless.

B004XISI4A|4.0|[[ASIN:0553801473 A Dance with Dragons (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 5)]]<br /><br />Dance, as it's predeccesor (Feast) does not move the story along in a very significant way.  There is progress, but not as much as I would have hoped for.<br /><br />After reading Dance, only one thing is sure: winter has yet to fully arrive.<br /><br />I started reading this book in May 2011, but had to take a break from it while studying for exams.  I was about 40% compelte with the book and lost my place whilst studying. Upon wanting to continue reading the book after exams, I found myself using every excuse in the book to not have to reread the first 400 pages.<br /><br />I think the biggest contributor to this reader's block I experienced was the fact that the story moves so slowly at first.  I guess I forgot just how detailed Martin goes into Westoro's history.<br /><br />Finally in March 2013 I forced myself to start rereading the book and now I'm extremely satisfied that I did in the end push forward.<br /><br />Shortly after the halfway mark I found the book much more captivating. The story started progressing quite significantly and I could see the blocks starting to fall in place in order for Martin to deliver two epic, battle-filled novels.  I genuinely think this book (and Feast) lays the foundation for Winds and Dreams to finally tie together all of the loose ends.<br /><br />All in all a good read.

B005S9EKCW|3.0|I am a huge fan of Les Miserables and have seen it many times over the years in Chicago, New York and London.  Over the years, I've been very impressed with the production because it has got to be a huge challenge to pull off well.  I was skeptical but I think they did a descent job.  I think Jackman did an excellent job.  I don't know why people think he did such a bad job.  Unfortunately, I think he is the only one.  I didn't Anne Hathaway's signing was so great, and every time I heard Crowe sing, I cringed.  Javert is a strong character, and Crowe's singing was too thin and weak.  I thought Bonham Carter was okay (she was FANTASTIC in \\"Sweeney Todd\\") but Cohen was terrible.  He seems one dimensional to me.  I've seen him play different characters, but they are all sort of the same -- characters who think they're more clever than anyone in the room.  The sign of a good actor is when you see the character rather than the actor.  I saw Cohen trying to act, and that was disappointing because its a great role.  Too bad he blew it.  I also thought it was interesting hearing the Cockney accent for people in France, but I guess I understand why they did it.

B007Y2W44W|5.0|I've been a Nile fan since 2000/2001<br />The first Nile record I heard was Black Seeds of Vengeance.  So of course it holds a special spot in my heart.<br />These guys keep producing amazing death metal.  Release after release, it's always my top album of the year.<br />Sethu is no different.  It's hard to believe, but it might be my favorite Nile album.<br />People whine about the production, but I absolutely love it.  It's incredibly clear, I can hear EVERYTHING that the band is playing.<br />One of the things I've always loved about Nile is how catchy their material is.  Sethu is that and more.  Brutal as all get out, still blistering fast, and some amazing solos.<br />Like Those Whom The Gods Detest, there are some seriously killer riffs, Sethu even more so.<br />Sethu seems to combine the old school Nile sound, with the new.  Maybe that's why I enjoy it so much.

1400052181|5.0|This is a true account of a woman who's death brought about scientific miracles. It details the relationship the author bravely and tenaciously sought with a baffled family and the rich joy which eventually followed.<br />It's not a medical journal but a plainly detailed story about a family so courageously told for the layperson.<br />A wonderful  read!  A keeper!

1401938906|5.0|E Squared by Pam Grout<br /><br />Pam Grout is my new favorite author. I enjoyed reading this book so much that I would love to read and know more from her. E Squared is easy to read, fun, all the ideas are scientifically supported, credible and something that sets this book apart from the others is that Pam gives us experiments to prove that our thoughts really do create our reality. I tried the experiments, and I was blown away by most results I had; this is my experience:<br /><br />Experiment #1 The Dude Abides Principle: I got a ticket to see Eckhat Tolle and Deepak Chopra at the Chopra Center in Carlsbad, California. How cool is that!!<br /><br />Experiment #2 The Volkswagen Jetta: I didn't see any sunset-beige cars, but I saw lots of yellow butterflies while watching Baby Einstein with my kids.<br /><br />Experiment #3 The Alby Einstein: I got rid of all my wire hangers in my last Spring Cleaning, so I couldn't do this experiment.<br /><br />Experiment #4 The Abracadabra: What I learned from this experiment is that you have to be specific when asking for something to manifest. I focused on getting $ 5,000 but I didn't specify if I wanted them in cash of check, so what I got was a spam e-mail with a picture of lots of bills a huge sign \\" Win $ 5,000\\" in the bottom of the e-mail.<br /><br />Experiment #5 The Dear Abby: I asked God and my Angels for guidance on how to make my business more succesful, and what I got at the next morning was a bunch of creative ideas, and something made me yell YES!!<br /><br />Experiment #6 The Super Hero: Haven't started this experiment yet.<br /><br />Experiment #7 The Jenny Craig: I lost 1 pound by just thinking every zip of water would clean my organism.<br /><br />Experiment #8 The 101 Dalmatians: The friend I was thinking about and sending lots of blessings and happiness, rarely posts comments in Facebook, however at the second day of my experiment, she posted a picture of her beautiful growing vegetable garden and expressedhow happy she was about it. That same night I was watching a movie and it turned out it was filmed in Verona,Italy; the city this friend is from.<br /><br />Experiment #9 The Fish and Loaves:  My favorite gesture of gratitude was a little happy dance a homeless man did when I gave him a dollar bill in my way to work.
B0064MPXFA|2.0|I haven't had problems streaming other products, but the second episode wouldn't even play past 8 minutes.  It was very frustrating.
0525423281|5.0|You know that you have enjoyed a book when it only takes you 1 day to finish it. And oh boy did I enjoy this book! Even more than Anna and the French Kiss.<br /><br />Perkins has this wonderful way of crafting her stories with unique characters that as a reader you have no trouble becoming emotionally attached to. I loved Lola as a protagonist, and even found my self waiting anxiously to see what she would be wearing the next day. Her mentality to life is inspiring, full of creativity and charm. She speaks to the moon, which some people might be like waaattt? But its such a unique characteristic of hers that sums up her personality rather perfectly....as well as her romance with a certain boy next door.<br /><br />\\"I don't believe in fashion. I believe in costume. Life is too short to be same person every day.\\"<br /><br /><spoilers ahead - readers beware><br /><br />Let me just start by saying that I did like Max...at least in the beginning. And in the end I didn't really hate him as much as Lola because he was just being honest. Yes he is one of those boys who aren't able to express his emotions and isn't really interested in anything that goes on in Lola's life - which sort of was there downfall. He just didn't get her and Lola was too concerned with being somebody that she thought she should be, doing things that she thought she should be doing, that when Cricket crawled back into her life there was no wonder that she began to question everything. And like any teenage girl, she doesn't necessarily have the life experience to deal with these things properly. Which is why I loved her conversations with St Clair, especially about the one.<br /><br />Yes Anna & St Clair are in this book too. I must admit that I was rather surprised at first, then I read that its a companion novel so I was like ahh duh. And to be honest normally when series do this kind of thing it doesn't work, at least in my mind, because I always find myself wishing that the original characters story would continue because the companion is never as good. But how pleasantly surprised was I when Perkins writes with such shere brilliance that she is able to use these characters to bring an extra pizzazz to a new story. You still get to see the wonderful love between Anna & St Clair, but what I really enjoyed was how they helped Lola find herself again..rather unintentionally.<br /><br />Ahh...Cricket! How can I even possibly put my feelings about you into words. I do know one thing for sure though - I am not adding him to my book boyfriends list. Wait! No its not because I don't admire is flare and the fact that he invents things...so is clearly good with his hands... but he is just so perfect for Lola! He just understands her. Plain and simple. Why can't a boy throw toothpicks at my window?<br /><br />\\"I know you aren't perfect. But it's a person's imperfections that make them perfect for someone else.\\"<br /><br />Lola's parents are equally amazing! I loved Andy and Nathan, and even Norah grew on me. But I had such trouble trying to figure out how to say Calliope that I just ended up calling her Calli. This book does deal with a few darker issues than Anna and the French Kiss did. There is talk of drug use, sex and same-sex parents. I loved the world that Perkins created, and how her characters were so real that once I finished I felt like such a loser for believing they actually existed.<br /><br />If you liked A&tFK then pick this one up, even do so if you haven't read about Anna & St Clair. You won't be disappointed, and its one of those books that you can't stop thinking about.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|This is a awesome album. I love JT music and this by far in my opinion it the best one he has done since the last CD. All the songs are easy to listen to and dance to.
B007NG93CK|4.0|This was a very good read. Great to take on holiday/vactaion with you. It's a real page turner. Most of the old reliable characters turn up and they don't disappoint. Already looking forward to the next one.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|I you are a fan of the MIB series you know that the second doesn't measure up to the first. No such worries with MIB 3.
B007KQI1NA|3.0|I bought this to use as an NTP time source for my computer network and for that purpose it does not work well.  It drifted a lot and would lock up after about 24 hours requiring a power reset.  Used on an intermittant basis and with mapping software it probably works well (which is what it's designed for).  I bought it because the price is more reasonable then the other devices like it.  I ended up using a GPS evaluation board from Sure Electronics at similar cost and it works very well but would not work very well for traveling with a laptop like the more compact BU-353 will.
B00AQSF6BO|5.0|On his latest offering Vicente steps outside of the traditional compas and sound of flamenco to a world music that includes the rhythms and sounds of Irish and Arabic influences.  The genres blend seamlessly in an eminently listenable marriage of shared<br />culture.  The sound is lush and romantic with plenty of welcome surprises.  One surprise is the haunting singing voice of Vicente Amigo and his choice of a cedar-topped rosewood guitar by Gracillano Perez for a number of tracks, both of which lend a softer Latin jazz feel to the tracks than is evident in his previous recordings.  Highly recommended.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|What more can I say.  This is a fantastic series.  Purchased this as a gift for my dad and it arrived quickly with no headaches as I would expect from Amazon.  Thank you!
B003IKMR0U|5.0|Almost everyone I've taught this game has had a blast and become instantly hooked: my students, my friends, my coworkers, and even some nice old ladies at the bar. It takes two minutes to learn, it's exciting, it's very portable, and it has great potential for discussions about probability and risk in a classroom setting. For example, you could start with the simple question of the probability of rolling \\"ran away\\" on a single die, but you can introduce combinatorics to model the probability of choosing some number of red dice (the dangerous ones) from the cup at random, etc.<br /><br />As an avid gamer myself, I prefer longer, more strategically nuanced games, but this is a great social game that I can teach quickly and always have a good time playing. It's also a good warmup game for a longer game night.
B005PR422K|4.0|Thoroughly recommended. Written in an easily read style backed by the author's own experiences, this book gives great insight and inspiration.

B0060MYM3S|5.0|Got this for my mom.  I have never watched the series, but she loves it and says that she has watched it twice already.  According to everyone I have spoken with this is a good gift for any movie lover into Knights, Kings and medieval times.  She says its engrossing and addictive.
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|Anyone who knows me knows how I would answer the age old question; &#34;If your were marooned on a island which artist's music would you want to have with you&#34; My answer would be Boz. Boz took a turn with But Beatiful, and I really don't like that album or the next one either, and while Memphis is a somewhat return to the Boz I have known and loved all my life, it's still falls pretty short of the rest of his library. Very mellow disk, with some good tunes, but if it was a disk by another artist I might not give as much leeway as I am willing to afford Boz

B009HNDSL4|5.0|The family situations and how they were handled reminded of the game &#34;Pass it on&#34; or &#34;Gossip&#34;. No one wanted to take responsibility for their actions & everyone wanted something from someone till Jay was the one holding the bag at the end. It was a story I think we can all identify with in life. I laughed till I cried.

B000Q76K1A|5.0|Love all of Damon's films. This is definitely one of more fun film series (The Bourne movies). Are you kidding me?
B006LSZECO|4.0|I have had this one on my wish list for awhile after hearing about it on a blog somewhere awhile back. As much as I wanted to read it I couldn't justify paying $12.99 for an ebook so I put myself on the waiting list at the library. I was number 57 on the list and while it took awhile to get, it wasn't as long as I thought it would be. Okay onto the book. For the first 40% or so I didn't understand what all the hype was about for this book. Don't get me wrong, it held my attention but it was a simple he said/she said story up until that point. When I got to the reveal however, my jaw literally dropped. Let me just say, Gillian Flynn has a twisted, warped mind for coming up with this story line and I will also say, I LOVE it. She skyrocketed to my top 3 authors list just my the twist I read right there. I knew I would love the rest of the book no matter where it took me.<br />Semi-Spoiler Alert:<br />I must say after being in my own messed up relationship I am not sure if I could have done what Amy did in this book, but it was brilliant. I am sort of jealous for never thinking of this myself. :) Even after the reveal, there was so much to learn. This is a pretty dark read and you are never sure where the next chess piece will land. Even though both Nick and Amy were unlikable characters in general, by the end, I almost liked both of them and could actually relate to them in messed up ways. I kind of worship Amy's (well, I guess really Gillian's) devious thought process. And Nick, well Nick is just a guy, however I do believe in that crazy, I love you to death mind-phase, maybe they are meant for each other. Needless to say, they will always be on their toes around each other.<br /><br />This book is one that will stay in you mind for some time after. I haven't quit thinking about it since the ending last night. I even started another one of Gillian's books as I was so impressed with her writing style and warped mind.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|Easy enough for kids ages 4-6. Same platform as Mario Bros from the original Nintendo. So I would recommend it,it's entertaining.
B005OT2YVA|1.0|Michael Bay proves yet again that special effects and explosions cannot make a moving film.  The Decepticons vs. Autobots is a black and white dichotomy that was ineffectual and uninspired.  The Decepticons are so 1 dimensional, that they cannot even reach victory without screwing it up with betrayal.  The Autobots get a quantum of better treatment, but, are just as 1 dimensional as the Decepticons.  Bay's treatment of women, and their subsequent comparison to automobiles is objectification at it's worst.  One shining feature, the robot battles are not super closeups of robot bodies filling the screen, making their combat indecipherable, but backed up, so one can understand that at least something is going on.  He barely learned his lesson in that regard.  Otherwise, just an awful film, that honestly, is the best of the three.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|It's a really good album...been on rotation ever since i received it...best rocking album in recent times!!!<br />Don't have second thoughts on buying this.

B006MW3V6U|4.0|I thoroughly loved the series, of course (consequently the 4 stars) and it was definitely viewable on my pc with its huge external display.<br /><br />Issues: the &#34;right&#34; price in my mind is around $9.99 not $14.99.<br /><br />Secondly, and more importantly, we viewed these streaming videos through HDMI on a brand new system and STILL there were far too many instances of choppiness and &#34;pausing&#34; (screen loading). Made the viewing experience much less entertaining.<br /><br />Did NOT buy Season 3...
0240815807|5.0|The most well written mixing book I have ever seen. The concepts help my mixing tremendously. I would never sell this book back, that is how much it helps. Time and time again I refer back to during my mixing to tackle specific problems I have have during audio production.
B009KWL0YE|3.0|This film is a little predictable once the premise is set. Ringo is his laconic self, but is not really involved. I am a Sellers fan and this frankly disappointed. The best I can say is The Magic Christian is OK, but not Magic, and has nothing to do with Christian.

Definitely would watch it again.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|***This review may contain spoilers***<br /><br />Yes, I'm late to the party.  This would-be science-fiction epic has already garnered over 3,100 Amazon.com reviews with little danger of abating.  Therefore, I'm probably adding no new insights into \\"Prometheus\\".  This review most likely adheres to the criticism most 1-, 2-, and even 3-star reviews have already observed: \\"The movie is just about flawless technically, cinematographically, and conceptually, but juvenile and superficial (for the most part) in character creation and motivation.\\"  Arthur J. Bullock's Question and Answer format Amazon.com review has already ingeniously encapsulated my and many others' views of logic lapses in \\"Prometheus\\".  So, what's left to say?  Well, I guess I'll just basically summarize the aforementioned logic lapses with the opinion that the Prometheus crew's lack of professional discipline grievously hinders the movie.<br /><br />Contrary to what others believed, I felt that the numerous petroglyphs outlining the Engineers' frequent visits to Earth ostensibly to initiate life were sufficient incentive to organize an outer space expedition to contact these progenitors (even if they DID look like albino bodybuilders).  What irked me was the unlikelihood that a private corporation would be permitted, or even have the resources, to attempt this interstellar flight.  I would have thought that searching for humanity's origins should be a paramount international matter.  And yet somehow the wizened, apparently deceased Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce, looking like Goldmember from the third Austin Powers movie) has scraped together a trillion dollars (I guess quintillionaires exist in the 2090's) for the half-baked purpose of going to the Engineers' solar system to somehow find an elixir of youth and immortality.  Even more baffling, instead of amassing the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of biologists, geologists, archeologists, and other -ologists, Weyland decided to select the motliest of crews for this little space trip.  With the exception of the competent, devout but intellectually curious, and surprisingly scrappy Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and the near-infallible but disregarded and even faintly malevolent and enigmatic android David (Michael Fassbender), the crew is an unorganized joke.<br /><br />In actual charge of the gargantuan \\"Prometheus\\" vessel is the sinister, irritable icicle Meredith Vickers, with a gradually revealed connection to Weyland.  The rugged, capable Captain Janek (Idris Elba) is reduced to being a passive spaceship chauffeur. Dr. Shaw's colleague and love interest Dr. Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) is cocky, brash, unkempt, and unwisely disdainful of David.  Rounding out this ragtag gallery is the really unprincipled doofus duo Fifield (Sean Harris) the geologist and Millburn (Rafe Spall) the biologist, who turn out to be the equivalent of the \\"red shirt\\" officers in Star Trek.  What a bunch of winners!<br /><br />No Prometheus crew member - not even Dr. Shaw or David - follows any kind of protocol or discipline, military or otherwise.  They seemingly act as if they're on some pleasure cruise, with time to play pool, swig vodka, make bets, and make love.  Captain Janek occasionally and vainly issues orders.  Usually he's idly staring at the schematic of the Engineer cavern stronghold on moon LV-223 or playing his squeezebox.  Everyone else does whatever the hell they want without supervision, including Dr. Shaw's do-it-yourself Caesarean to extract a squid fetus.  Therefore, it's relatively easy for David to explore the cavern, decipher the hieroglyphics, get samples of the Engineers' DNA ooze, and \\"vengefully\\" start the mutation havoc onboard the ship.  Again, I recommend you read Mr. Bullock's review to get an outline of the genetic blunders the crew foolishly unleashes upon themselves that utterly unravels the mission for almost everyone.<br /><br />Watching this movie, I couldn't help thinking that, for all the time-worn techno-prattle and tired, corny humanistic themes, the Star Trek crew (whether Captain Kirk's or Picard's) would have handled the momentous events on LV-223 more professionally and competently.  Certainly some crew members would have been infected and even killed, but the main characters would have thoroughly analyzed the terrain, the Engineer corpses, the caverns, and the pods before going into action.  The crew would also have heeded any information from Spock or Data and acted appropriately.  Furthermore, the Star Trek crew would have had time to address evolutionary, theological, and even ethical implications of the missions meaningfully.  Star Trek naval discipline would have made more epochal discoveries about the Engineers without blowing up their ship. But then again, this discipline would have bored some Ridley Scott or \\"Alien\\" fans who wanted their icky snake/squid/slimy tentacle thingie fix.<br /><br />What a waste of a evolutionary/theological vision!  Dr. Shaw is practically the only Prometheus member still curious about the Engineers.  Others, like the doomed Dr. Holloway, thought that the revelation of the human/Engineer 100% genetic matchup solved the problem - Humanity comes from Engineers.  Dr. Shaw perceptively retorts \\"Who made the Engineers?\\"  The mystery continues, and only she and David's head are still around to pursue it (in the Prometheus sequel).  Perhaps the sequel will also answer the questions 1) Are the Engineers attempting to correct their run-amok planetary DNA sowing, including that of Earth's?, 2)What did David say to infuriate the resuscitated, murderous Engineer?, 3) Where is the \\"Neck-Pillow Shaped\\" Engineer spaceship escaping to?, 4) Can Dr. Shaw and David follow them in another \\"Neck-Pillow Shaped\\" spaceship?, 5) Can Dr. Shaw really trust David? 6) How will the surprisingly humanoid xenomorph emerging at the end of the film figure in all this?<br /><br />Whatever the \\"Prometheus\\" sequel holds in store, I hope Dr. Shaw and David encounter a space crew that has more in common with the discipline, philosophy, and mentality of \\"Star Trek\\" than that of \\"Friday the 13th\\".techno-prattle and tired, corny humanistic themes, the Star Trek crew (whether Captain Kirk's or Picard's) would have handled the momentous events on LV-223 more professionally and competently.

B009EEFTMC|4.0|Would have been rated 5 stars if graphics were a bit more modern. Seems like it was built/designed 10 years ago.
0062014536|5.0|excellent book!! i always worry about series of three, because the middle book can be more of a &#34;bridge&#34; to a drawn out third book that could be better all wrapped into one. IN THIS CASE HOWEVER, i found  all three books had solid identities and plots, and i really enjoyed them. teen target audience, but will be enjoyed by adults who can appreciate this fact and will enjoy oliver's liquid and descriptive writing style. worth the wait for them to be released!
B000O8OTNC|1.0|This \\"sharpener\\" is terrible. It does not sharpen, it dulls and damages blades. After using it on my SOG Twitch XL, and my ka-bar, both blades are duller than before and it damaged the Twitch XL blade. DO NOT BUY!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was so bad I couldn't even finish it. I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.  Reads like a teen romance with sex thrown in.  Simplistic writing and advocates all the fantasies that keep women in unhealthy relationships. Men who behave badly are damaged and our love can save them.
B004UPANGM|5.0|Classic slapstick horror comedy that even today sends both chills and laughs down my spine.  Cult classic that everyone should see!!
B007HACDLK|4.0|Vince Flynn is an excellent writer that seems to draw in the reader FORCING you to continue without stopping! I read the entire book in two days!
1477419497|1.0|I stopped reading this book on my Kindle at 31%, which is about page 119.<br />At first I thought the book was just slow to start. The book began with the main characters Maggie venturing to Cannes in the hopes of rescuing her (5 or 6 year old, the book listed different ages for her) niece from her rough French father. Her mother, Maggie's sister, was missing after getting involved with drugs. A British man stole the girl for Maggie and snuck them out of the country. Then we follow Maggie at home in Atlanta in her job for awhile. Suddenly, the evil French man shows up to blackmail Maggie and returns Maggie's sister, Elise, in bad shape.<br />Elise begs Maggie not to tell their parents but to give her a few days to get cleaned up. She tells Maggie about the violence she endured at her Frenchman's hands. Then she informs Maggie that she will need to score some crack soon to keep it together.<br />The next day, Maggie goes to work, which seems weird. Her sister was missing, presumed dead, shows up strung out and hooked on drugs, so Maggie goes into work at her advertising agency.<br />That day, Elise is killed. Does Maggie tell the police that her sister was a crack addict and she may have let a drug dealer into the house? Does Maggie tell the police that Elise lived with a violent man who dumped her in a parking lot the night before? No, Maggie says her sister had been living in France; that she was an artist.<br />Not only does Maggie not tell the police, she is dishonest with her best friend and family; her inner dialogue doesn't indicate that she thinks this should be an issue at all.<br />Since I'm only 119 pages into the book, I'm going to hope I haven't given away any spoilers.<br />I generally like the author's writing style and think the book could have benefited from some editing to streamline it and then just some honest reflection on what each character knows or should know.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|My 6 yr old loves this movie. It is not as annoying as a typical child's cartoon movie, although I could live without the annoying hiphop number at the very end. We watched it together as a family and no one faked a stomach ache to go to bed early.
B008K8U13K|1.0|I can't get the app to download it says error every time!!!! Please fix!!!! I should have listened to the reviews!
B004TI5N38|4.0|I must admit I am a big fan of David's writing!  This is yet another great book!  Thanks David! Keep 'em coming!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|It was tough reading sometimes because it was fairly technical at some points but definitely worth the read to appreciate what he went through and the experience he had.
B004UID2LC|5.0|you should get this app the only down side about this app it needs Internet other than that you should get this app
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|his greatest hits cd is awesome- it is fun to sing along with in the car -mostly upbeat- all radio hits
0446580848|3.0|This is probably my least favorite book of Nelson DeMille's repertoire.  The hero of this story is John Corey, a NY policeman who also goes into places in harms way like the Middle East to ferret out the bad guys.  This time it's Yemen where an operative known as The Panther is out to get Corey because he eliminated The Lion(last book) and also do some major damage along with his Al Qaeda buddies.  John is accompanied by his attractive,  attorney wife Kate Mayfield who unfortunately has to cover up her beautiful face most of the time in this assignment.  Since John Corey is the narrator the book is full of wise cracks, wry remarks, and the usual sexy innuendos regarding his spouse.  What I found bothersome about this book is that it starts out with a lot of action meaning some slit throats, good guys chasing bad guys, bombs going off and so on.  In the middle of the book there is a long period where Corey and his group are \\"waiting to be kidnapped\\" by The Panther and of course they are hoping to set a trap.  Well, this seems to go on and on while listening to dialogue about using the excrement shaft in a castle, to eating goat, Kate covering herself up yet again,and endless macho man jokes.  It gets a bit old and I don't feel that this novel was up to the standards of DeMille and his earlier books.  My favorites being the Charm School and Up Country, even the last book The Lion.  Maybe next time Mr. DeMille will get back to his style of creating more suspense and keep us guessing as to what will happen next.  This book was kind of a yawn!
B0036TGT3E|5.0|At last a Disney movie that teaches children to deal with the death of a parent in a realistically emotional way. Yea, I know. Talking animals, songs etc. but it's the emotional core of the movie that speaks to all that see it and moves them. Speaking of the songs, they're wonderful and stay with you no matter what your age and the characterizations are spot on. It's longish but the execution makes the time fly by.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I played this game before on my phone, and now on my Kindle Fire. The bigger screen makes it soooo much better!  Pretty straightforward - just get at least 3 of the same jewel, clear of the spaces, and drop the star to the bottom before time runs out.  Takes a little bit of focus and coordination, but other than than, a relaxing distraction.  Nice background music, although it can get annoying to hear the same music over and over.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I'm giving it 4 stars because I've always enjoyed a good, exciting Bond movie<br />since sean Connery played him. I'll miss crusty, old Judi Dench<br />as &#34;M&#34; in future 007 flicks, though.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|I get that this is more like a fairy tale, but honestly, the impossibility of it all just really made this fall flat for me.  And what a lackluster ending.  Again, I know it's more about philosophy, but...I didn't get it.  And I'm not that shallow!  If there wasn't great scenery and special effects, totally boring.
B0050PYNO4|5.0|It is the best movie featuring a CGI alien that I've seen and I have a lot of fun having showing it to noobies
B000NTPDSW|5.0|We had 3 Saturday nights of great movie entertainment.  The High definition restoration is truly great.  Can't beat the movie.  And what made it even better was that I never saw the 3rd one.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Although the acting was excellent (DiCaprio, Foxx and especially Waltz),<br />there was a number of historical mistakes (ie: type of firearms used) as<br />well as an overabundance of bloody violence at the end. However, Tarantino's<br />walk-on appearance getting blown up by Django near the end was fun to see.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Not as spectacular and engaging as the first three, but consistent enough and thorough in tying the entire series together.  Of course, any fan, even a passive one like myself, will want to see this and it's certainly enjoyable.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|The greatest who EVAR is finally on DVD! YES! YES YES! LOVE the extras! Can't wait to wear it out and buy another one! Om nom nom nom nom
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|OK, the movie is strange, but then Hitchcock was strange on a good day.  Anthony Hopkins drops everything Hopkins and truly BECOMES Hitchcock.  A great experience with quotable quotes.
B005USZYDU|4.0|Grisham did it again.  Only bad part was this is a serial so you have to get other books to finish the story
B00BI73CVI|5.0|We were skeptical; as it seems anything based on a book and/or with high-paid actors and/or huge production budget gets nominated these days (i.e. Life of Pi, in which I was sorely disappointed), but this film evokes real emotion out of the toughest shell!  The live singing is fantastic and felt more sincere and less silly than watching a musical with dubbed singing and dance numbers.  Wow, I bawled, and I don't think I've really shed a genuine tear watching a film since Forrest Gump.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|It was a very good movie with a great script! It was easy to watch again and again! Loved it!
142312166X|3.0|I wasn&#34;t expexting one story to take up half the book. House of Hades was an enteresting tale none the less.
B00C1C0WCQ|4.0|My family loves the jurassic park movies. we just saw the 3D one in the movies, AMAZING! highly recommend going to see it
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Completing this series had to have been like holding a handful of sand on a windy day. Some was lost, the shape slightly altered, but the sand of Jordan's work was held true.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|I love this album so much!! It's made even better since Fall Out Boy came off of hiatus. I definitely think that their music style is somewhat different than their previous albums, but all musicians want to expand and try new things.<br />Don't miss out. Definitely recommend this album to FOB fans and basically any music fan that wants to listen to this band. Love them!!
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|Several years ago I purchased secondhand the complete set of the original edition of the Great Books with authors included up to the end of the 19th century. This included the incredible Syntopicon. That set is in my office at Hindmarsh. Then I purchased hard copy new of the latest edition of Great Books which included authors in the 20th century!! That set is at home. But now I am able to read Great Books on my iPad1 at bedtime and show my patients when at work on my iPad2 via iCloud via Kindle. Unique incredible technology!........But you ask my opinion on \\"Race against Machines\\"... Put simply. \\"Essential reading for all teachers and all leaders in society!\\"
0451232852|3.0|I thought the book I was ordering was in a larger format.  Was disappointed in what size book I was ordering. Can't complain--- the price was right.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|ZDT is better than Argo. Also a fine movie. But this was better acted, written and directed. Nice going! Have seen it five times.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its fun!!! so uhhh..... yeah thats all i got...... and uhhh 9 more words?!?!?! but uh yeah I like it!!
B0083EXW50|3.0|The album has some great heavy cuts on it, but towards the end has some weird sythesizers and sound effects that distracted me from what I wanted to hear, Metal!
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|Nobody likes the way the voice is so don't get it.OK OK it is funny but do not get it.

B0012FHGCW|5.0|This is a wonderful movie.  It will inspire you to live.  It will make you smile and make you wonder why not?
B002NZK5QY|3.0|I got htis DVD expecting to hear gloroius Mozart pouring through my speakers.  Instead I got a recording in mono.  Major disappointment!  It should have been noted in large letters with the listing.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|The movie can be summed up in one comment from the movie: &#34;You don't chose the dog.  The dog chooses you.&#34; I would alter that slightly with the addition &#34;and you will be won over.&#34;  I don't expect this happens a lot partly because of the much shorter life of the dog than the human, but a one owner dog can get very emotional for the external observers.  When the chemistry between owner and dog flows well the bonding is very impressive and provides warm yearnings on how life should be.<br /><br />I was surprised at how fast it arrived with the group of DVDs ordered, but I decided to watch it at the end - saving the best for last.  I was not disappointed.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Dan Brown is amazing. I love every book in the Robert Langdon series and this is now one of my favorites.
B0090EIILU|2.0|There's a fine line when comedy becomes distasteful - If Sacha Baron can find that line, he could go long way, otherwise I'll be cautious to watch another of his film..
B0098460O4|5.0|Amazing performance by both Jonathan and Charlotte!!!  Very upbeat and uplifting songs... couldn't be more impressed... I must have listened to this album a half dozen times already and I only received it a few days ago.  Way to go J & C!
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Love it. Watch this movie. If you like video games, you will like this movie. Bonus, it's a love story, so.... date movie you will both like.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|this is so cool it wake me up for school and it has the weather on it so I don't have to go on the Internet it is asmose I would get it
B0081L37Z0|2.0|Comedy is not synonymous to dumb! And dumb doesn't necessarily make things funny. Comedy can be made in a tasteful and intelligent way - Monty Python would be a case in point.
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|The tilt control is kind of bad with this game on a Kindle Fire.  I often have to tilt my Kindle all over the place to keep my shark going in the direction that I want to go.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|This is a fun book to read with my granddaughter.  The book has helped her to use her immagination.  We enjoy the time together.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book makes you feel every emotion possible, to the point where you are left drained of everything you have left. It does everything quickly but feels longer than it really is, making it perfect. I would recommend this book to anyone who has lost their humanity, and wants to feel it again, or anyone who just wants a book that will force them to think.
B004I1WIWU|5.0|What a great vocalist and songwriter this woman is. Every single song is killer, soul-ripping, gut-grabbing. Rolling in the deep is the outstanding track here, but so is the last song, someone like you. This album was inspired by Adele's break up with an ex. Boy, poet's shure need the pain.
1608955702|5.0|I have all three of Neil van Niekerk's books and they are all very helpful.  This book is the newest and is focused on understanding the benefits and uses of different qualities and directions of lighting in photography.  The book uses natural light, reflected light, on-camera and off-camera flash, and some of the best bounce flash I have ever seen to illustrate these ideas.  There are straight-forward and complete descriptions and directions for accomplishing the presented ideas.  The book is a good read cover-to-cover, but you can also just flip to a section or photo you like and the descriptions will stand on there own.<br /><br />It is clear that a lot of thought went into the writing, structure and layout of the book and it really pays off for the reader in a very usable and educational book.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|its the best show on tv to date! love it!<br />thriller and would recommend to someone who<br />likes that type of show
B008602KQI|1.0|I wish I could rate this zero stars! Very bad movie, but what do you expect when the book itself is awful? The production quality is also very low. I think maybe the rushed it to completion while the book was still popular. I would NOT bother with this at all.
B0000707YX|5.0|So, 1991, 16 years old, to me GNR were gods back then, had overplayed my tape copy of Appettite and Lies, out come this two record set UYI and USYII, i could only get the tape for the latter one and had to tape the first one.<br /><br />I always liked the second one first, but the first one is not bad, November Rain, Live And Let Die, Don't Cry were the popular cuts. but the real gems aree the Izzy Stradlin composed/sung songs: Dust and Bones, Double Talkin' Jive, You Ain't the First.
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|The song that will bless you: God Is Here - In Jesus Name - Victor's Crown - Jesus I Love Thee ( I Love You Jesus ) - I Am Yours<br /><br />And if you have the CD + DVD Deluxe - Shout to the Lord w/ Agnus Dei this song is phenomenal!<br /><br />this album is amazing and an album for all Jesus Christ true worshipers!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Loved this movie, finally Christian movies are finding their place in the industry, this is a wonderful story and Christ is throughout this movie.
B001992NUQ|5.0|Fun if you like violence, great classic, and amazing picture quality.<br />Liked how the Blu-Ray menu comes up while watching the movie with out having to go to the home screen.
B001I10ABO|5.0|Shure they got millions of fans before this album and a zillion after it. Not their heaviest but maybe their catchiest. The vinyl version comes in a 2 record set, and mine was almost flawless, just one small pop that went away with a good cleaning.<br /><br />This album has got to be in every serious metal collector.
B000P0J09C|5.0|\\"Kubrick, by the way, makes me call him 'Stanley.'  I can't stand it.  The guy is a thoroughly charming and easy-going guy, a real good ole boy.  He could f--- my sister, if I had one ... We are working on creating a 'more satisfying' ending for 'The Short-Timers' ... 'But Stanley,' I said, 'the Vietnam war was not bloody well satisfying.'  'Right,' he said, 'but they made you go to Vietnam, and people are going to have to pay to see this movie.'\\"<br /><br />--from a letter Gustav Hasford wrote to his friend Bob Bayer on 11 December 1982, as quoted in: [[ASIN:3822831158 Stanley Kubrick: Visual Poet 1928-1999 (Basic Film)]]<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I love the part where the drill sergeant credits Lee Harvey Oswald with making a shot that, clearly, no-one could make, just because he was a Marine ... classic Kubrick!<br /><br />As for Leonard, well ... he should've been \\"vetted.\\" You can tell by the way Kubrick films him in the opening scene -- even just getting his haircut, he's \\"spacing out\\"!

B00AHXIC50|5.0|I bought this when it was the deal of the day and have not regretted it. Amazing sound quality for a downloadable CD, and great to listen to on the amazon music cloud.
B0041TM5OU|5.0|I guess if you are starting up in jazz or want to start someone up, this is the album to do it. Quite accesible, the coolness of it is mesmerizing.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I enjoy Literature. I enjoy Edgar Allen Poe. I like Kevin Bacon. And Joe is not bad to look at either. Overall it is a well written series. An extremely dark story line. Twisted individuals joining a cult where they learn how to kill and feel no remorse. I have become a bit paranoid watching this. You never know who the killer is. Basically it is sick and twisted and mesmerizing. The leader is extremely charismatic and handsome. I can't stop watching even though I realize this can not be healthy or normal veiwing material for a mother of seven to watch. Addicted and waiting for more.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|do not down load it gave me a malware program on my phone and took for ever to get off it
B0042TV4IW|5.0|You'll be In a world that may never have been, but you might wish could be true.  All characters have faults in this series, but no one is an unredeemable villain, (even if some may be pretty annoying).  All done in fine style--settings, events, and characters.
B006ZCWTZG|5.0|To me this album ahs it all, rock, soul, country, gospel, you name it. Bruce at his best, comes with a free CD too. Fisrt single we Take Care of our Own shows the state of Obama's America nowadays. To me Land of Hope And Dreams is the best cut here, the live version is an absolute wonder. Do yourself a favour and buy this record.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Such an awesome book, couldn't put it down.  Can't wait to start book 2 and see what lies ahead for these characters!
B007WULJ5G|5.0|Never before has a film been so amazingly perfect to watch with your whole family.  After acquiring a fully uncut version of the film, I invited my parents, grandparents, siblings and their kids over to watch.  We popped some popcorn, had some soda, and all sat down to enjoy what was arguably the single best family film of our generation.<br />The nieces and nephews both laughed at the \\"Hit her\\" scene, while my grandparents had fond memories of the old country during the \\"newborn\\" scene.  My wife and I laughed so hard at the final reveal, and were genuinely surprised.  My siblings, of course, agreed that they found the ending perfectly to be inspired, hopeful, and left them feeling good about themselves, as we all felt.<br />Over all, I would say that if you have a very close extended family, invite them over for movie night and pop in what I can only described as a truly amazing family picture.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Very inspirational. At times humorous and light and other times thought provoking and cause for self reflecting. Definitely recommend if you are a runner or you care about the power of the human spirit and our love of mankind
B001G5ZNE6|5.0|Comes with a free CD. Got to admit that i find mysel humming the title track, can't get it out of my mid. The rest of the album is amazing.
0670026557|5.0|Does exactly what it supposed to.  Very happy with the final product.  Worth every penny I spent on it. Yes!
B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|Out of all the Star Trek series I find DSN to be the most interesting because it is deeper and a bit darker. The show is still relevant to todays world. Great special effects. Still looks fresh. The music to the opening credits is a work of art.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I had never heard of the Piano Guys until I saw a special on my local PBS station last month. They really add some pizzazz the classics. Their music is great for both young and old alike.

B009HV2JT8|5.0|We purchased the DVD Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter for your library.  It is a wonderful addition to our library movie collection.  Thank you so much.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Firefly was awesome. I would recommend it to everyone!!! I didn't realize how fun it would be!! should not have been cancelled.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This was a very suspenseful movie even though I knew how it was going to end. John Goodman was awesome as usual!
B007QUUJMG|4.0|This book is perfect for any high school student. It shows the ups and downs a person can face. People change and you just have to accept that
B0036UMM84|4.0|The DVD A Star is Born was purchased and received on time.  This a good movie and will make a great addition to our library movie collection.  Thank  you so much.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Very much like the first game - good action responds well to commands. Fun!  My kids both enjoy it. It does get progressively harder so they both have to bail earlier than on the first game but they both love it.
B00355L2TU|4.0|I am currently using the first of the three-part series. I plan to implement this level for 10 days then do the same for each subsequent level. I appreciate the modified exercises demonstrated and guidelines/motivation for taking breaks...which really means don't take one.  \\"These abs aren't free!\\"

B006YTTVHO|5.0|It helped me a lot in social activities and I'm no longer shy even a little bit so that's good
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|I always feared when my brother went into the military a girl would break his heart while he was away, but when he feel in love with his now wife, it was almost just the book. When Sparks explains the war, my brother could relate exactly. Helps cilivian see that not everything or everyone is perfect and to accept each other for what we have to offer.
B00BJS7LHC|3.0|Django Unchained started out great and ended up okay, but somewhere in the middle, it fell a little too in love with itself and the pacing slowed to a crawl. Django is freed and then starts to work with a German bounty hunter, who is a wonderful character. When they go to Candie Land, a plantation where Django's wife is being kept, that's where the movie just fell apart for me. Leo DiCaprio is Candie, and he turns in a good performance, but there's a lot of repetitive dialogue and plodding revelations. Django allows a slave to be torn apart by dogs, which made him an unsympathetic character, whereas before that moment, he was pretty cool. Yes, there's a lot of blood - lots of juicy gun fights. Some of it is way over the top, but that's what you expect out of a Tarantino film, so I have no objection to that. The movie is very long and would have been much better about half an hour shorter, but if felt as if Tarantino lost his way and was trying hard to insert tension in the middle, and for me, it just didn't work.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I really liked it, as well as my grand-daughter, it was a fair size and was well made.  Would probably order it again.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved this book it was really funny and had quite a few surprises you are spending your money well
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|This game is lots of fun. It keeps you entertained for hours. It's not too hard, but still presents a small challenge.
B0051OZ564|2.0|This movie was confusing and did not make much sense. I had a hard time staying interested. Waste of $1.99 rental fee.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it it is so cool I have it on my phone and kindel trust me I love it a lot!!<br /><br />written by an 8 year old
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|Starts a little slow but once it gets moving it's compelling. Couldn't put it down.  Would have kept going on the second book but....10.99?
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great acting, great filming. Better than anything else on TV except for breaking bad and homeland. Come to think of it- better than majority of movies!
B00AKFG15S|5.0|I love jeffrey archer books he would be one of my favourite authors, he has a great variety of worldly happenings
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I've seen many decent reviews for this mono lavaliere microphone, which I wanted to fill an occasional need to record talent standups and interviews to either my iPad (we Skype to cable news channels) or Zoom H1 recorder as a separate audio track for my videos; it does both suitably well for these purposes.<br /><br />I should note that my needs are not high end, but I still want sound much clearer than I can achieve with any on-camera mic; this unit does just that.<br /><br />I found two quite miner negatives. First I found the installation of the watch-type button battery to be a bit challenging, using a table knife to push the spring aside in order to make enough room to slide it in. Even still I had to give it a fair amount of force to coerce it into place. Secondly installing the foam windscreen was also tricky as it's very tiny and you have to work to get that itty-bitty thing stretched over the equally small mic element.<br /><br />The cord is very long, which I knew about, however I will be thankful the first time I want to plug it into my Kodak Z8 camcorder, which is really an excellent match for this mic.  Finally, the plug appears to be mono (2-conductor) in the photo, however the one I received has a stereo plug (tip, ring and sleeve) which feeds audio into both channels of my stereo recorders, which is a good thing since it means I will not require a mono-to-stereo adaptor.<br /><br />On balance I would recommend this to you if you have similar requirements.
B0083Z614S|4.0|I loved this book! My favorite part was when Mary found the key to the garden. Wouldn't it be amazing if you were inside a garden that no one had been in for ten years!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This battery app is very effective and very accurate...At only $2.00, it is definitely worth it...Don't waste time on the free app, with this paid version you get all the features...A great app to add to your Kindle Fire...
B009FB3XTA|5.0|chose this CD to add to my twilight music collection..... I love the CD....love the movies!!  Recommend to all TWI-HARDS!!
B00B1E6FF8|2.0|I don't know if it was just all of the hype of hearing other people talk about this movie, but I have to say I was incredibly bored throughout the entire movie up until that last 20 minutes. Don't watch when tired!
B001BANK32|4.0|King 's ability to propel the story by giving a meaningful narrative from the perspective of each character gave this story so much more depth than I thought it would have. It's eerie, thoughtful, and compelling. If you liked the movie I think you'd love the book. It's a fun read and although Kubrick's film is captivating, I think I might actually enjoy King 's plot a little more.
0307743659|4.0|Purchased this book after watching the moving (for the hundredth time) because I wanted more background to certain parts of the story. This is a great read and totally fleshes out parts that weren't explained completely in the film, fun!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|this is a great game it isnvery fun but not as good as temple run I think anyone will like this game it is good for small children.
B008NABUU8|4.0|I haven't decided if it is more fun to make the cars cross or to make them crash. It is cool to make all the different bridges with different supplies. -Review by almost 7 year old son.
B00AFOS8A0|5.0|It is amazing to see so many world-class vocalists and conductors in one set.  One of the early Verdi pieces featured Jesse Norman, Jose Carreras, and Montserrat Caballe!  And that's in a minor piece.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Very fun game I love all the hungry sharks will continue to play and play and play and play and play
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|For a long time I've been trying to read the trilogy and I'm so glad I did. It was the most interesting series I read, every chapter I read kept me wanting to read more. It was addictive almost. The only bummer was the ending.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have trouble getting to sleep as it is. When I started using this app it took some getting used to, but now I don't know what I would do without it. When I'm lying in bed with a restless mind I turn to this app, pop in the head phones and just relax. It's great for meditation too.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Excellent. I am casting the movie.  Chris Cooper, Bradley Cooper, John Slattery, etc.  Still working on the female lead and Jacob.  Wow, tough ones.  Help me Hollywood.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I love this game!  It's fun, extremely addicting,  and challenging as the days go on in the game.  Keep bringing us more fantastic games like this!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I'm about half way through the book and like most of his books it is informative, thought provoking, as well as entertaining.
B00699SDR8|5.0|This book is an excellent intro to philosophy, even difficult concepts are explained and easily understandable.  More research is needed for in depth explanations, but an excellent starter book.....
B007HC3LHS|5.0|At first it was a bit confusing as it kept jumping back and forth years but once you really start into it you will see why. I'm almost finished with this book and will read more by this author. It is a great first person story teller.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved it!! Astonishing book !!:D it's  a great book about his life and  how he is a wallflower with his friends great book
B004LQI1PA|5.0|I rented this. The streaming was very smooth and sounded great. I have never seen the musical performed on stage and really wanted to hear it with this cast. It was great! The only weak part was Nick Jonas, which would have made a few of the songs even better.
B0064MGU98|5.0|not real deep but I love it nun the less . love watching shows this way also. really rooting for her!
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I didn't think I would ever own an automatic mechanical watch again because good ones are expensive. Luckily, I found this on Amazon fir such a ridiculously low price. It's both beautiful and accurate. This green one (available in many colors) almost looks like a military watch.
B009GX69RK|5.0|New Girl Season 2 somehow passed season 1 in just about every department. I didn't think that was even possible. The character evolution and relationship progression is outstanding and humorous!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a good weather app that is well laid out.  At the drop of a hat I can peak out the weather window and foresee how I should be planning my days.
B005HSL626|2.0|Once again this is a &#34;FREE&#34; to a point game.  It plays a demo but to really play the game in its entirity you must PURCHASE it.  so the FREE is only there to catch you and then make you spend money.  fortunately for me, i wasn't hooked enough to purchase it.  You may like the game, but if you want it I recommend buying the complete game.
1574241451|3.0|With a ten-year-old 335 on its way to me thru ebay, I looked forward to receiving this book.  But it is a disappointment: a hodgepodge of stock photos, sidebar items, and material that bumps up the page count without telling us anything more about this particular model.  Those of us with Gibsons made in the past 8 or 10 years won't find help in sorting out the many, confusing iterations of the later models.<br /><br />Both layout and photo quality have a homemade look that's just not up to standard in this age of digital composition.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fun for a variety of ages. From my friend 4 year old all the way to adults. It provides you with daily quests to earn gems that are usually a pay product which allows all players to get the better items. Great time killer.
B000002A73|5.0|Perfect condition. I allready own a unopened version of this album. It is not worth a lot, But I will not breake the seal, yet
B007TNS6JI|1.0|Didn't get caught up in this game either..sorry. No real reason just didn't peak my interest enought to keep me playing.  Sorry this isn't really informative, but that is the truth.  The graphics were good, well as good as a free game will ever be and the game itself was well...eeh, just not what I like playing, or maybe I should say, I like RPG's but this one was not my cup of tea so to speak :)
B008IBPMZG|5.0|It doesnt get much better than this. Great writing, acting, camera work, costumes etc. Really a joy to watch. Highly recommended.
B008AS5UAO|4.0|From my no doubt limited perspective, I don't know if there is a \\"perfect\\" recording of this most complex of operas.  The dark themes of Don Giovanni are often at odds with the utterly gorgeous music and the comic aspects of the work, and that's affected every performance I've ever seen and every recording I've ever heard.<br /><br />This recording, like every other recording I've heard, is imperfect as well, but it has some exquisite singing and other good aspects.  First, the exquisite singing - I give the highest marks to the men, at least for the most part. Ildebrando D'Arcangelo as the Don is alternately suave and slick and menacing as appropriate; a very impressive performance.  Similarly the Leporello of Luca Pisaroni.  However, my biggest ovation goes to Rolando Villazon, whose singing is definitely in the \\"exquisite\\" category.  It's wonderful to know that he has survived his much-reported vocal \\"difficulties,\\" but if this recording is indicative of his vocal state, he's better than ever.  His Don Ottavio is, simply, the best thing he's ever done as far as I'm concerned, and that includes a phenomenal recording of La Traviata with Anna Netrebko as his Violetta.  The Commendatore is a weak link, and while his role is very small, any sense of terror is missing from this role.<br /><br />Alas, I don't think the women perform as well - particularly Diana Damrau.  She has some lovely passages, but her tremolos are dangerously close to being vibratos that you can drive a truck through.  And while I appreciate that anger has a role in Or Sai Che L'Onore, she's so shrill as to be unpleasant to hear.  (If you want to hear this aria as it should be sung, get hold of a recording that is as yet unavailable in the US - a 1960 performance from Salzburg with Elisabeth Schwartzkopf and Leontyne Price; Schwarzkopf is simply wonderful, and I say that as one who normally finds her singing so refined as to be boring - she's in great voice and pulls off the drama without a an ounce of shrillness or screaming.)  Joyce DiDonato is much better, though I find her singing curiously bland.  Of course, the Zerlina, Mojca Erdmann, has generally been criticized, but I find the criticisms unwarranted; she has a lovely voice and partners quite well with both D'Arcangelo and her Masetto.<br /><br />Another subject of criticism has been Yannick Nezet-Seguin, but for my money he does a very creditable job.  He's been charged with a non-dramatic performance, but I think the conflict among the dark themes, the comic aspects and the exquisite music is an enormous challenge for any conductor, and all-in-all I think he's quite good.nce of shrillness or screaming.)

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Pretty good reading. I would recommend it to those who are looking for an easy book that is also interesting and filled with compassion.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I am not a fan of angry birds so I really am not a judge.  The children in my life like this app.  It keeps them busy in the car and just randomly when they want to play.  If they like it...I like it.  Hope you do :)
B003E48AYC|1.0|Both Blu-ray and DVD had defects/scratches. Neither discs would play the entire movie with stopping and or skipping.  did not look like new discs.
B00AEQYM6S|5.0|Is there anything Kaufmann doesn't do brilliantly?  I frequently find recital albums tedious, regardless of the quality of singing, but this one blew me away.  His voice is amazing; it has a baritonal quality that is even more impressive than Domingo's, and it is expressive throughout what seems to be a huge range and at all volumes from pianissimo to fortissimo.<br /><br />His choice of repertoire is also impressive, particularly his decision to record the Wesendonck lieder.  Those four songs are worth the price of admission alone.<br /><br />If you are interested in Wagner, or even just great tenor voices, this is a \\"must have.\\"
B00B671W6W|5.0|when I saw the track listings on this album I was not sure if getting it would be worth my time. I have been a big anthrax fan since the 80's. After listening to the songs I had no idea belladonna had the range he did! my favorite song on the album was \\"smokin'\\". It was really nice to hear anthrax do something different. the guitars and organ mix was cool and blew me away. I never thought I would be hearing an organ like this on an anthrax album but it really worked. It was really nice to hear them play something different.  His vocals on \\"keep on runnin'\\" blew me away! I had no idea he had the range he did. Although not a typical anthrax album I found this album refreshing and a pleasure to listen to. I would recommend this album to any anthrax/non-anthrax fan as well. It was great to hear them do covers of their influences. As a long time fan, I have always wondered who their influences were. I only wish it was longer and had more songs. I hope they will release another one like tesla did. I would strongly recommend this album. I found ALL the songs great and fun to listen to. Keep the music alive. pass it in on to the younger generation and show them what music should sound like!
B00AQ71FLK|2.0|Not what I was expecting.  Good graphics but the game play was not what I was looking for.  You may like it but I like more adventure in my RPG's  Unfortunately my reviews have to be a certain amount of words before I can submit my rating so here it is.  ...Not my fave but you may like it
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Well written, clear and concise, it allows you to understand easily how to publish your book. Easy and simple is good, always!
B00AFYZDL2|3.0|Produced bythe great Andy Sneap, one will like this album according to his own preferences, of course.<br /><br />Although this is being billed as a \\"retunr to origins\\" album, this is nothing like it.<br /><br />This is typical Saxon post-KILLING GROUND, and unfortunately, worst. They are better than the Charlie Bauerfeind'produced albuns (when they came close to becoming sheer euro power metal-aargh), that's for sure, but this is not a leap forward comparing to CALL TO ARMS. In some aspects and songs, it is worse, with generic and derivative guitar solos all along, songs that go straight to chorus and repeat themselves...<br /><br />Anyway, SAXON is better than a lot of metal bands around. Period.
1451648537|5.0|I started reading the book and almost couldn't put it down. Spend several evenings with it instead of the TV.<br /><br />It took me awhile to read it because parts would remind me of the 70's, things going on there and I'd be thinking of the past for 20 minutes. I knew exactly where he was coming from. He was a child of the 60's, I of the 70's.<br /><br />The only problem was I thought it was too short and I didn't like the way it ended. I'd want more details, this book could have been twice as long and I would have loved it. Thanks for the memories.
B00913DPW2|3.0|Liked the story in the game.  Loved the fact that not EVERYTHING was mystery find...Goodness I am sick of those where's waldo games.  It was hard to get started at first, didn't know you had to keep trying the knob to let you into the first level of the game and then I had to guess at the fact you had to put the knob back in to open the door...who does that?  I mean, If it were locked and you put the knob back in wouldn't it still be locked? ...soory got off the subject lol. Once I got it it kept me busy.  I did like this game and played til I finished.  Hope you like it too :)
1455527475|5.0|It's well written.  Greg painted a great picture of GS.  I dont know how anyone can buy this book and not like it.
B00C5ZNUCS|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this band or release. In a world where bands and music are created by executives to generate cash flow, these guys shine through as unique, gimmicky, and fun! Oh, and they also rock while totally creepy you out! Awesome all around. You often times feel like you are running from a ghoul in a Scooby Doo cartoon and other times hearing classic doom rock! Awesome!!!!
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|Seeing a film of this musical really elevates it above the stage versions. The battle scenes and other graphics just make it come alive. I didn't think most of the singing solos were that good. In fact, some of the actors had really not sung before. The movie is also very long and drags in parts, but overall, worth the purchase.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Great story great voices from different actors and actress love Scotland and the accents and humour great animation and effects
0385344333|5.0|Great read! I look forward to other &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; stories. Complex plot but easy to follow with author's bread crumbs.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Jumps out and grabs you, then wont let go. Watched all three season in a week! Can't wait for next season!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Truly loved this book and for the first time in a long time I was able to read a book again that I did not want to put down. Now off to read the next one :)
1936719118|5.0|I love a good personal story. It makes sure it's real and it can be done, not some vague theory about what should be done. I love the fact that you can pick and choose in the things he did. A good story with many learnings. Do it your own way, decide wether your want to grow or not, do it with real people and really put the customer first, even if that means the company might not be around in the future. Putting the customer first means you will keep finding ways to create value for them, and hence survive.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  There is a lot of action and great acting.  This movie does contain a lot of graphic gun shot scenes and could be consided a little gruesome (because of all the blood you see when someone gets shots).
B002EXEGTW|5.0|Old but good, worth watching and a true story. Acting directing and script all first class, good way to kill a few hours. And cheap!
1250027624|5.0|Now that I'm a follower, I try to keep up with everything available.  This is beautifully put together book and one that would look good on display.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|I love angry birds, but this one gets me so mad. however my son liked playing it so go figure.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This is honestly one of the best films I've seen in a long time. Very suspenseful and intriguing. Must see!
B0078Q2HAA|1.0|Silly me for thinking that the liberal filmmakers would do justice to a brilliant woman and portray her as Britain's greatest Prime Minister and the woman who saved the country from demise. This is just a movie about an old woman suffering from dementia - it could be anyone. I hope that now Maggie has passed away someone will make a movie that catalogs her accomplishments and successes and goes into far more detail about her rise from grocer's daughter to prime minster. The dementia is an important part of her life that should come at the end of the movie. All in all I was disappointed but I should have expected this and will be looking for another documentary/movie that treats her with the respect she deserves.
