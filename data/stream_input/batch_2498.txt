B0074VTHKM|5.0|I loved the way the characters were developed; I could actually picture them in my mind, as if I knew them.  I found that I couldn't read it fast enough, because it so captured my interest.  I have never read anything I didn't love from Mr. Grisham.  I thought maybe Mr. Grisham had started this series to get younger readers interested, but the Theodore Boone series is great for adults, too.
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|Spoiler alert.<br /><br />.<br />.<br />.<br />They took a key scene from ST2 and repeated it. That was bad because 1. They just repeated what'd been done! 2. I did not for a second believe Kirk was going to die (at least the old ST2 let Spock die and made it very interesting in ST3 to bring him back).  3. I saw from a mile away how they were going to revive Kirk. The foreshadowing was not even subtle. 4. Spock's \\"Khan~~~~!\\" was pure self-parody, I couldn't help laughing.<br /><br />Before Pike died, Spock went and had a mind-meld with him without asking for permission. I thought some revelation would come out of this, but it turned out all Spock learned was the \\"fear\\" one feels before one dies. This makes Spock a voyeuristic jerk.<br /><br />The rest of it is just non-stop mindless action. They don't even try to imitate the original ST characters anymore. Spock is supposed to be endearing, not annoying: \\"I have a few attitudes....\\" that's just lame.

B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I read the book while it was in theaters and loved the book. I finally saw the movie and I thought it was great! It wasn't too different from the book and I loved the actors in it. All of the places (Ivan's, her cabin, the store etc.) were exactly how I pictured them to be! Very pretty scenery in the movie. I just loved it!

I gave this product a 4 star because I wished the movie itself was all on one disc and all the special features  on another. I was not aware that the movie would be split in half into two disc which was kind of inconvenient. However, great movie, great product, and the seller followed through with shipping time. =)

B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is such a fun little game. The concept is simple, you're a shark swimming around, eating pretty much anything that comes in your way. Watch out for the obvious badies of the sea, it's pretty easy to die if you swim at the wrong thing. The gameplay is surprisingly immersive, and the little quests and things have funny titles which adds a nice bit of humor. I can definitely recommend this game to casual gamers, I know I'm hooked!

0525478817|1.0|The book is just twilight with cancer kids. I don't understand why people like this. the characters are incredibly snarky they seem  way to smart to be teenagers(yes i could tell this was being written by a man in his mid-30s) and I could not feel sorry for them. Mainly cause pulling the cancer card is cheep trick that authors use to generate sympathy for characters we would otherwise despise and I saw right through that vail. Worst of all John Green is a good writer usually( I read an abundance of Katherines and Paper Towns and loved them) but this book is his worst to date. Are all these reviews being written by little girls? I was very disappointed. And yes I am boycotting the movie when it comes out.

B00BFTV09K|3.0|This is book is a most important book for the health of all countries and especially USA and Australia, my home. Lots of specific details are given and the book is based on very thorough research. However, the problem with the book is the organisation of the information. The writer jumps around in a unsatisfactory way. I don't know the best way  of organising the info but perhaps the author could have devoted a chapter to each of the big players and given a chronological and analytic account of their activities with in each chapter. Despite my criticism It is obvious from the book that the big food companies are controlling us and our governments. The big companies are very powerful and protective of their position. Through careful research they know how to manipulate us. However the health of almost everyone is at stake except for those small minority of people who assemble meals from scratch so they can control salt and sugar content as well as  fat. Like the USA Australians eat out a lot and use lots of processed foods at home. 7 Eleven shops are 90% confectionery and chips. We in Australia need to have better labelling: big print and user friendly language that informs and does not confuse.

B001JIHGO0|1.0|My oldest daughter and I like a good horror movie, but we have few opportunities to see one together.  Imagine our disappointment when we viewed this one.  The special effects were good.  The acting was credible.  The story, however, was disjointed.  At times, it didn't seem to follow any discernable plot.  It was almost as if two or three different people who weren't talking to each other wrote different parts of the movie.<br /><br />If I can prevent you from purchasing this movie and wasting your hard earned cash, I will consider my time writing this review as time well spent.

0375851569|5.0|I remember growing up with these books. Asking my mother to read them to me more times than I can count. Learning to read on them. I'm buying this set for my niece's first birthday gift and her parents are thrilled. With so many negative influences available to children in this day and age, I'm delighted that Dr. Seuss's timeless works are delighting children to learn to read. May these books live on for generations to come!

B0082Z447U|4.0|William Wylkie Collins (1824-1889)published 'The woman in white' in 1860. Reading it today this Gothic mystery has an amazingly modern feel. For instance identity theft plays a major role: dishonest financial dealings, use of psychoactive drugs and manipulation of women's rights (minimal at best in 1960) are all to be found.<br />The book has an unusual sttructure in that selected major and minor characters narate their involvement as the mystery unfolds. As our hero Walter Hartright says at the outset 'As the judge might have heard it so the reader shall hear it now'.<br />Collins was a lawyer and so was familiar with this approach. His artist father surely provided the building blocks for the character of Hartright, a teacher of drawing.  Hartright is a modern hero in that with little experience or money he confronts his enemies of the age: class, nepotism, wealth, deviousness and knowledge.<br />The setting is London. Whilst out walking late one evening Hartright meets a young woman dressed completely in white who claims she has escaped from a mental asylum. He assists her to reach her destination and freedom. Later he accepts a position at a country estate, Limmeridge House. He is hired by Frederick Fairlie. a hypochondriacal dilletante who is guardian to two young adult sisters, Laura and Marian.In addition to his work cataloguing Fairlies art collection, he teaches the girls to draw. And so the stage is set to unravel the relationship between the sisters who are so dissimilar in every way and what is the connection of the 'woman in white' to Limmeridge House and its inhabitants. Laura is betrothed to Sir Percival Glyde whose weird associate,Count Fosco, is married to Fairlie's sister. Why does Glyde want to marry Laura against her wishes? Marian helps Hartright to unravel these complex problems although his heart is with Laura who is very much a pawn in the twist and turns of this tale.<br />I can heartily recommend this book. Collins went on to write The Moonstone' in 1868. T.S.Eliot thought this was 'the first, the longest and the best of detective novels'. One coud say 'The woman in white' bears a similar relationship to the genre of mystery writing.
B0061PEAUY|2.0|I'm not a history buff, so all the details about Indian history bored me.  The suspense part was just okay.
0061928356|1.0|This story started off with such promise, and I'm now upset with myself that I wasted the time to read to the very poor ending.  It just kept getting more and more tedious. I should have closed Secret Daughter and tossed it in the trash because it was a huge disappointment after the great beginning.<br />I did read that this is Ms. Gowda's first book so maybe she is just inexperienced,but her characters become paper figures lacking any depth.  She writes about a very interesting subject - female infanticide in India - but does a great injustice to the possibilities that the book offers at the beginning.  Maybe she was rushed or impatient to finish the book. Secret Daughter does feel like a book where the author lost interest early on, and had to finish it - like a painful term paper. 1-star only but hoping that Ms. Gowda takes more care if she writes more books and produces a book that lives up to the first chapter of this book.
0307720950|5.0|\\"The past ten years have been about discovering new ways to create, invent, and work together on the Web. The next ten years will be about applying those lessons to the real world.\\" This book is about the next ten years and how people working together on the web are using digital design tools and a host of new manufacturing techniques to bring their ideas to life.<br /><br />The most important thing I learned is the viability of Open Source Hardware as a business model for the 21st century. As Anderson explains, this involves giving away the `bits' (the software developed by a community of users) to sell the `atoms' (the physical product). I really enjoyed reading about how Anderson himself used this model to launch and run an aerial robots company called 3D Robotics.<br />Many other reviews have summarized some of the key ideas in the book, so I'd like to instead list some of the ventures profiled in the book as Anderson tells the story of the Maker revolution:<br /><br />● Local Motors: open source hardware car company<br />● Tesla: electric car maker that has revolutionized the manufacturing process for automobiles<br />● Square: combining atoms and bits to revolutionize the credit card payment industry<br />● Kickstarter: crowdfunding site that also provide market research and a community of supporters<br />● Quirky: community of users that help with the product development and manufacturing process<br />● Etsy: online marketplace for handmade products<br />● Sparkfun: online retailer of electronic kits and parts<br />● TechShop: a membership based tool shop for Makers<br />● MakerBot: maker of  3-D printers<br />● Ponoko: online 3-D printing and CNC services<br />● Shapeways: 3-D printing and other manufacturing services<br />● MFG.com: world's largest custom manufacturing marketplace

0307474275|5.0|The Da Vinci Code, an action and romance novel written by Dan Brown and published by Doubleday in New York, April 2003, centers around a middle-aged history professor named Robert Langdon. On a trip to Paris to give a lecture, he suddenly finds himself being accused of murdering the curator of the Paris Louvre, Jacques Sauniere. With no alibi, Langdon finds and ally in Sophie Nevue, a young cryptographer from the French government, and granddaughter of Jacques. Together, they face a perilous journey thrust upon them by Sauniere to find the Holy Grail whilst avoiding the police and the enemy force, who is willing to kill for the Grail. With the help of Leigh Teabing, a Holy Grail historian, the pair unravels clues and comes closer than anyone to finding the Holy Grail. In the end, after many surprising plot twists, Langdon and Nevue discover that the Grail is impossible to find, yet they still feel the holy presence of it within them.<br />Having read Brown's works before, I could only imagine the wonderful tale he would tell in The Da Vinci Code. I consider a good book to be enthralling, where the characters come to life, and you can feel the emotion. It was no surprise that Code did exactly that. I found myself caught in the race for the Holy Grail as Langdon and Sophie uncovered the clues, and felt my eyes water as Sophie was reunited with her long lost grandmother and brother, due to Brown's powerful and understandable writing style.<br />One great aspect to a novel is a good plot twist. Brown delivered as much in this fantastic novel. \\"He was portly and was propped on a pair of aluminum crutches...It was Leigh Teabing.\\"(524) An unsuspecting reader could only feel bad for Leigh Teabing, a Holy Grail historian, in previous chapters, as he had seemed like a helpless old man who only wanted to help his friends uncover the Grail, and was kidnapped by the enemy. However, in a shocking twist, the reader learns that the mastermind behind the enemy operation, the murdered of Sophie's grandfather, was Teabing himself. This left me at a loss for words, as of all the characters to have been a double agent. Teabing was the least likely.<br />Another characteristic to a wonderful novel is a touch of emotion, which Brown managed to write in perfectly. I found myself mourning the loss of Sauniere along with his granddaughter, and tearing up with joy at the family's reunion. Brown managed to put so much power into his work that it was difficult not to show emotion. \\"Throwing open the door, she came out,...\\"Oh, dear child...look at you!\\"...\\"Sophie,\\" the woman sobbed, kissing her head.\\"(568) At that moment, the emotion was so strong at their reunion, and I found it incredible. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, as it factored in every key element in a good novel.d of Sophie's grandfather, was Teabing himself.

B009CF3MEK|3.0|This movie almost put me to sleep as it slowly made its way through one of the best American stories ever written. The sets, costumes, and production values were excellent, but I thought Robert Redford was very miscast as Gatsby. He barely lifted an eyebrow, and the special Gatsby smile was just not there. It was hard to believe the passion he had for Daisy since Redford's entire performance was so low key. Mia Farrow was good as Daisy, but her voice was all wrong.<br /><br />The famous scene at the Plaza on one very hot afternoon when everything came to a head between Gatsby, Daisy and Tom just fell flat. It could have been so much better if there had been more tension and feeling from the cast.<br /><br />There were highlights for sure. The music was perfect. Sam Waterson made an excellent Nick Carraway, and many of the supporting cast were excellent. The cars were wonderful, and the party scenes at Gatsby's house were excellent, although they were a little sedate.<br /><br />All in all this movie was a disappointment. Read the book instead.

B003VIWO9I|5.0|Terry Pratchett has always combined humor, intuitive brillance, and common sense in narratives that manage to entertain as they explore the human - and not so human - condition.  He is a master at using fantasy to explore reality, without being heavy handed about it.  His prose never disappoints, and &#34;I Shall Wear Midnight&#34; continues that tradition.  Tiffany Aching - the plucky and pragmatic heroine - is an engaging character whose adventures I thoroughly enjoyed.  To me, characters who can actually solve problems rather than just angst about them are SO much more interesting and entertaining.  The entire environment of &#34;The Chalk&#34; was presented in a fashion that combined the fantastic with the realistic in ways that made it very vivid and entirely plausible.  This book was definitely worth the time and the money, so I recommend it highly to anyone who likes their humor presented on a fascinating platter.

1401941893|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo30CK6E6GBM8UN]]This book is about 200 pages, the video shows you the book's layout. The first 100 pages are about how Miranda became a model. She tells you the story of her being in Australia and how her friend entered her in a magazine modeling competition without telling Miranda and how that was her first push towards modeling. Miranda writes in a very simple manner, and the point of the entire book is to believe in yourself.<br /><br />The last pages of her story (around the 100th page) consists of her favorite pictures, both private and professional photos.<br /><br />The last 100 pages are her favorite quotes with a picture of a butterfly on top.<br /><br />This book is good for preteens girls but if you are over 18 (or even a teenager), you might find this book lacking. The last 100 pages feel like fillers. She could have expanded her story to 200 pages instead of 100 and incorporated her favorite quotes into the book. Oh well.<br /><br />The book has a pretty design, and the vocabulary is simple so its a pretty fast read. I read this entire book in about 30 minutes. I recommend this book for young girls who are Miranda Kerr fans.

B00755MHXG|5.0|I could easily reread this book several times and will recommend it to my grandchildren at an early stage as one of the most beautiful lessons in humanity I have ever come across.
B001K3EXTA|5.0|Great cars, great set (I want to know if the house that was used is still standing).<br />Apparently this follows the novel pretty closely compared to some other fillm adaptations.<br /><br />Longish - over 2 hours.<br />Glad I saw it before the new version.
B004UPALT6|1.0|Waste of time, neither a good comedy or horror movie.  I do not recommend this for adults or teens.  Avoid this one.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|I was not sure what to expect, it's was a good movie overall, very real on life, not happy go lucky so don't expect that. Visuals were beautiful.
B000LJ9ZWO|5.0|This is a fun example of future-tech scifi.<br /><br />For the novelty factor, it is the first film to implement digitized/pixilated images. When the robots look at something their view is in pixels.<br /><br />If you need another seller to watch it - this is a very early Michael Crichton project.<br /><br />Very short, around 90 minutes maybe. It's worth a look as a novel, pop-culture icon.
B00BHMF578|4.0|The best role for Ben Aflek that I have seen, and his best performance.  What a frightening ordeal for those involved, very good movie.
B003L77FYS|5.0|This is the only TV show that I like.  The DVD's are great when I need to spend time with the TV I can when I want.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I could play this for hours. this will capture your attention and take your imagination to a world of war and deffending yourself is the most important. you can sign up for allies and help a brother out.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Angry Birds never fails to amaze. They do a great job with the graphics, the music and the all around fun elements of this one.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|Missed seeing it at the theatre, was not disppointed--similar to a Bourne movie. A movie one will watch more than once.
B0044RUSZM|5.0|My neck and shoulders are grateful to Griffin.  Excellent product and works well with my 15&#34; MacBook Pro.  I know look forward instead of down.
B0091THRCU|5.0|It fits the iPhone 5 great as long as you don't use any kind of skin on the phone.  I was looking for a slim case to protect the phone when it is in my pocket or laying on a table.  This case looks like it will protect it from small drops or falls as well.  It appears to be build pretty well and the pull tab makes the phone easy to pop out when needed.  Definitely worth the price.
B005SLS3VY|4.0|Harry Bosch's pursuits are always a good read and when his step brother Mickey Haller has been brought in they work together in this great thriller it makes it all the better. The Reversal is another of Michael Connelly's triumphs.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|Les Mis has been an old favorite of mine, ever since I saw the production in London many years ago.  The cinematography in the movie is outstanding, really taking the stage into &#34;live&#34; Paris.  The acting is very good.  But I find the singing not quite up to par with the production I saw.  Still, very enjoyable.
0399245030|5.0|If you haven't read Oliver Jeffers-you need to.  I have a 2.5 year old and we just found his works and are thrilled with them.  Great for adults and for children alike.  This book centers on a young boy that find a lost penguin and befriends him but thinks he needs to go home to the South Pole.  They make the long trek and clearly both are sad upon departing.  The boy returns and there is a great picture of an emotional hug and they reunite.  It's got a great visual of what it means to be friends and the allegory would be that your friend can be of any race, religion or species if you care for each other.<br /><br />The sequel Up and Down is a must have companion piece to this with the same two characters.  HIGHLY recommended for your young child that is the avid story listener.
B0012CH350|5.0|Bought to replace cover on my smoker... perfect fit.  Like all Weber products, this cover is well built and priced right.
B00AL3OD7C|5.0|A must have for any Rush fan - a great album and some great music.<br />The remaster also makes it better for iPods, and iPhone listening.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Found this little gem to be well written and rarely did it fall into the type of unnecessary descriptive details that can sometimes turn a good read sour. Great story line....My only criticism was that it ended to suddenly...left many unanswered questions...but certainly provides the author ample opportunity to continue on.<br />A fun read...
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Wish you didn't have to wait so long to fix armor or gain experience but oh well still a good game. My son enjoys it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game!!!!! There's so much to do than just one regular game :D Most games are just focused on one thing but this has much more
B00CDXOXB4|5.0|I enjoyed the book though it reminded me of Sleeping with the Enemy. I really enjoyed the movie. There were some parts that I think had I not read the book would have given me an \\"Oh I loved that moment\\" however having read the book I knew what to expect.<br /><br />I love the actors and actress they chose for the parts and they played them great! Perfect mix of romance and suspense.<br /><br />They did a great job in keeping true to the book for the most part.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Thrift Shop was the first song I heard by Macklemore and I decided to buy the album on a whim due to the sale Amazon was having, and it turned out to be a great decision. Macklemore raps not just about funny things, like shopping at a thrift shop with only $20, but also about meaningful things, like advocating gay rights. I love Macklemore and I think this is his best album yet.
B000VZPBFI|5.0|Can anyone tell me why the LP version if the track \\"Fanfare\\" is only 1:00 but the CD version is 1:22???? Did someone add a chant segment to the end of it?
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|I think I was expecting too much from the movie. I found the plot a little slow and was waiting for that moment when I would love it. I enjoyed the last 5-10 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />That said I think Jennifer Lawrence did a great job!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Great free way to keep your files organized. I personally got this for my Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34;.<br />Works like a charm.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|It a good game but sometime's the game crashe's on my Kindle Fire HD&trade; and doesn't let me begin a solo &amp; multiplayer match  :(
0307887448|4.0|I suppose one might object to a book that so clearly defines good versus bad, but in a book that is half video game, it is a necessary gambit. While white and black have no shadows, the characters are half shadow themselves-- avatars, emails, chat room denizens as well as flesh and blood. Much of this book is about identity, and finding connections. Give this to a young teen or an adult, and both will devour it. You know how boring it is to watch someone else play a video game? Well, reading about it in Ready Player One is a thrill. Nice. The 80's references are fun too. The setting is dystopian and grim, but the tone of the book is not. An enjoyable read.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|This such a good series I can't wait to read he rest of it. But I wish it more. Yay
B0053O89WY|5.0|This season did not disappoint, love all the characters. The only thing wrong was it ended. Cant wait for the Sixth Season.
B008K8VDPU|3.0|It shows you how to play.  The selection of songs are limited though but you can always buy.  It is good for a free app.
B007X4ECLY|4.0|i have a question for anyone who has bought this movie on bluray. have any of you had problems getting this movie to load at all? i'm now on my SECOND copy of this movie and both discs i've had WILL NOT load on either my PS3 or my laptop, making watching the movie impossible. has anyone else out there encountered this problem? any suggestions on what might be the problam or what may be wrong with it? all of my other blurays play fine, but this one just WONT work!! by the way, i did not buy my copies from amazon, i bought them at target so this is not A negative commentary about amazons goods.
B005I4JG80|5.0|I'm brazilian and here we practice a type of child education similar to the americans. Lots of stimulation and lack of discipline, in a certain degree. I'm also expecting a baby, so the book had great insights for me. I'll certainly try to apply some of the &#34;techniques&#34;.<br />With a great sense of humor the author shows us the cultural differences in raising a child in America and in France.<br />Interesting, light reading and well written!<br /><br />I loved it and recommend!
B009HNDTPO|5.0|It was quick and easy to order from my DVD player. Great quality and of course it is a great show
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have read a lot a reviews for this book but they didn't atop me from buying it.  I understand why there were some complaints but I'm not really surprised by the ending.  I knew when the whole Eric marrying a vamp queen came up that the end of their love story was coming.  I loved Eric & Sookie together but I knew it wouldn't last, she didn't want to be a vamp so what future was there?  Eric would never have stayed with sookie once she got old & sickly.  I am happy with my purchase & I wish people would stop being so negative because the book didn't end the way they wanted!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I think this game is alsome and love it I like the way the fights are on there and I like that u can build planes and tanks.and I think that the more people join the more fun it will be.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I have Fishdom 2 &amp; 3 on PC and really enjoyed them.  I played 2 so often I ran out of original ideas for decorating the tanks.  The graphics are beautiful and the audio realistic enough to be quite relaxing.  The same is true with this first version.<br />The match 3 puzzles are challenging and, at times, frustrating.  They definitely hold my interest.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|You need to see the ending to this gripping, compelling, insanely smart game. this game deserves a much larger fan base
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this freakin Game!! Its SO ADDICTING!! I kant put it down! i hwve this on my tablet, my phone! i kant just sit down!
B007ZYJT1U|3.0|I liked the storyline concept, but couldn't warm up to the characters-actors. I don't know what else I can say.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Downloaded this. Now can't stop. It's a really good way to lose track of time. I'd recommend this game to anyone.
B0094K1MH2|3.0|. . . But . . . it's still a cartoon.  Sorry, but it just couldn't capture my heart.  However, I do like the humor in &#34;Gromit and Wallis&#34; cartoons.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|It is too bad they are trying to cram so much bloat into an otherwise fun game. No need to try and nickle and dime users with no option to turn off ability to access the Internet.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Loki is Crazy!!!  That is all I have too say, don't require me to say more I am done!!!  Crazy
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I never was a Star Trek fan, until the franchise was renewed in 2009 with J.J. Abrams a head. Star Trek Into Darkness is a really brilliant sci-fi movie and is full of action complemented with the tremendous acting of the entire cast. And maybe just for me, it was very fresh and unexpected in many ways because I didn´t watch the old franchise, but  I always heard about Khan and I never imagine that this character will be so intimidating that made you feel that way.  I´m really satisfied with this movie and for the excellent work of J.J. Abrams that put this one to the top of movies of this year so over Iron Man 3 and over Fast and Furious 6 too. I only think this one could be down from the first place with Man Of Steel which Nolan helps write and that's a lot to say.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is my favorite novelist.  I have read everything he has written.  I wish he could publish one more often.  You will not be disappointed.  Read this and all of Vince Flynn's novels.  Excellent.
B007BVOEPI|2.0|I didn't like that I can't download it onto my pc. You're forcing me into Amazon products. I also don't like that I can't do a simple full screen option.
B004J4WLPU|5.0|Great book. Had me until the end. Never slows in intensity.  Wonderful character development, and the plot certainlynthickens with each turn of the page.
B0097GVJWQ|3.0|It was going along fairly well when all of a sudden it slowed up and then froze.  The storyline was good but maybe this would work better on a regular computer.  Don't know if I'll finish this on the kindle.
1594204217|5.0|It caught my attention on NPR  The outline of earth, fire, air and water reminded me of Chinese medicine.<br />The  science is intriguing, the personal stories are fun and the overall book is thought provoking.<br />Eat Local has a whole new meaning for me.
0385737955|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. The author did a great job with the plot. It had me on the edge of my seat and turning pages. It's a great distopian, so anyone who likes that genre would like this book. I don't have any real complaints worth mentioning. It was a clean read, and I'd recommend it to teenagers. There are some mild graphic scenes, but not bad. Overall--I enjoyed it!
B0038P59A0|1.0|Well before this movie came out, even before most people had heard about it, I printed out three photos, RDJ, Jude Law, and Mark Strong in costume. I would ask people to choose which one was going to play Sherlock Holmes. Everyone picked Mark Strong. There are a lot of things wrong with this movie's treatment of the stories and character of Sherlock Holmes and this pretty much exemplifies it.<br />Robert Downey Jr makes a perfect Tony Stark. He was wonderful as Charlie Chaplin. He seems to have lived down his past. He is nothing like Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock Holmes is tall and lean with a \\"catlike love of personal cleanliness\\". Not short, rumpled, unshaven and wearing a dressing gown that looks like rats have been nesting in it. I'm not going to go into personality discrepancies.<br />I spent Christmas day 2009 in a theater an hour's drive from my home in order to see this on opening day. I own the dvd of this and the sequel. I try to be fair. I like Jude Law and I even think that Guy Ritchie might have made something of it if he hadn't been encouraged to make it into a typical Guy Ritchie movie. Lock, Stock, and a Three Pipe Problem?
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I picked this up a couple of weeks ago and played it into the ground. The gameplay is enthralling and mesmerizing, and the desire for just one more run will keep you going for a while.<br />It's rather short, but the mechanics stay fresh until the end of the game, so more content would be welcome.<br />Highly recommended, and I'm glad to see it as the FAOTD.
1609611543|5.0|Very impressed with the research that went into this book.  After we started to read this book we began to implement the suggestions about a wheat free lifestyle.  We were more into the health aspect of the book rather then the loosing weight direction.  One  side benefit is of course the weight lose.  We are still trying new recipes and have not been disappointed in what we have tried so far.  The most significant observable health benefit has been an almost total elimination of allergies.  Prior to the Wheat Belly book, I had to carry an epipen.  Over the years my allergies had become more severe.  Almost 20 years of allergy shots still had not brought about significant relief.  Within the last few years I had developed severe reactions to bug bits.  One bite could swell up and make me look like a red inflamed body builder near the site of the bite.  A couple bites would more then double the size of my arm.  The swelling, inflammation and pain would last for more then a week.  I carried bug repellant every  where but still seemed to get bitten.  A couple weeks after dumping the wheat, I was at a friends house and  had not done my bug spray and got bitten 3 times.  Killed two of the little varmints and the last one got away.  Friends and family waited around for the rapid reaction to the bites.  Disappointed them all and pleased me, when the 3 sites of the bites were found with absolutely no reaction!  Had to look real hard the following day to see if the bites were visible.  Since then I have had a few more encounters with no reaction.  I know it is only anecdotal information but if its working I am going to stick with it.  An interesting thing we have found is we don't get that starving feeling between meals.  Nor do we feel like we have to stuff ourselves to feel satisfied with the meal.  The nice thing is its a very workable way of living, no  ..... if its Tuesday, its cabbage and carrots.... or other complex eating menus.  We did have some guilt feelings whenwe gave away some of our wheat products to family and friends.  Kind of felt like we were doing a disservice to them.  Can't say enough good about the positive changes this book (and the cookbook) has made in our lives.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love how the game keeps changing and never ends!<br />Best picture find game ever! Wish the energy regenerated faster though.
B001L5VYFI|4.0|Owned this album set years ago. Downloaded tbis version but when i copied as mp3 to cd. Lots of static and garbage. Will try again..
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|A overall delightful book. I could not put the book down for more than one second I would recommend this to all my friends
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is my favorite one so far as I am not a fan of many games. This game is easy to navigate and fun to play!
B00756GRUE|5.0|First off this watch is beautiful, and then you pick it up and immediately you can feel that it will survive anything. A few people mentioned the bracelet as an issue but for me I sized it and like it. I might brush the mirror links later down the road but it doesn't look bad imo. I really like the touch of blue it just makes the watch unique. The functions all work flawlessly and the time is super accurate so far 6 days and not 1sec off. The screw down crowns just reinforces that the watch is able to handle a lot. Setting it up was easy and just after getting a bit of sun it starts working and I doesn't seem like it will ever stop. Its a big-ish watch but my 6.5inch wrist still works perfectly because of the way the lugs are designed. The watch just looks really sharp. Lastly the lume is amazing, you can easily see the time at night no problem and it lasts a long time. I highly recommend this watch.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|I would not have purchased this if I could have seen the detail of what it could and could not do.<br />Disappointing!
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|This is one of the most ACTION PACKED moves we have seen. We would have loved to have seen this in an IMAX 3D theater!<br /><br />Loved it.
B00BF2UKDE|5.0|not as good as being in the sixth row at the ryman auditorium in nashville, watching one of the most explosive, phenomenal performances i've seen in my 44 years, but still pretty good.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Excellent for helping baby learn to put his pacifier in his mouth and its a great teething toy.  My son is 6 months and never puts this thing down.
B00792EGES|2.0|Vocals are to loud. If you want a concert experience that is. The Amsterdam show had the same problem, but at least that show had some punch and power behind the music.(Bass and Drums) Was looking for what they did with the Creed show sound and power wise. With my system Creed's Show will blow you completely out of the room. The Amsterdam show gives it a good try.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is very challenging but that is part of the fun.  You try to make it as far as you can without running out of fuel or flipping over and crashing.  You also can earn coins to buy new levels and vehicles.  In my top five favorite mobile games.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Grabs the viewer quickly and has a fast moving story. Well done but the plot is scary to think about.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It's so different than what I expected. A love story like no other, although not sure about the love part. Sexy, erotic, passionate novel. Will definitely buy the second book of the series soon!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works great on my kindle fire! I can understand why some would say the ads are annoying, but come on, it's free!!! Thanks for the hours of enjoyment.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|i love it . . its very fun and productive. plus i feel like im really learning to play on my own with the instructions it receive.. . .
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Easy read and enjoyable.  Mostly believable.  At times I was ready for the next act but overall and fairly enjoyable read.
B00BOLE7X0|1.0|very bad did not care for it it was the actors that made it bad so no i would not ask any one to buy this movie
0316228532|2.0|This really pains me to write a bad review for the book, because (1) I LOVE JK Rowling's writing and (2) I'm a total Anglophile and am actually interested in this stuff.  But wow what a boring and dreary and tedious book.  The funny bits aren't funny.  The 'deep' bits are predictable.  The 'shocking' bits are gratuitous.  I tried both reading the book in hardcover (I was so excited!) and listening to it from Audible.  Neither method was enough to get me past Chapter 8.  If it wasn't JK, I would have given up long before that. I hope her next book is a big improvement (that one, I'll probably get from the library...).
B00BJS7104|2.0|boring until the end Jamie Foxx is not a good cowboy actor at all not much more to say about this movie
B0063GORYU|3.0|Another game for the doctor's waiting room.  Beats watching the walls and keeping an eye on the clock for your appt time.
B00B00RJJO|4.0|OK there are no upbeat zingers on this one but overall this is still a very good listen.  Critics might say too country, too slow.  This is a first impression but with multiple spins you will be able to pull out many gems on this album.  My favorites include Do Unto Others and No one knows nothing anymore.
B00007GZQI|4.0|Peter Sellers and Ringo Starr??? Together? Oh my yes. Classic British 60's lunatic-fringe comedy! I'd only ever seen this once on television in the States --now I know with one scene edited out!-- when I was a kid, but oh, how it stuck with me! Glad to find it again.<br /><br />Ringo plays the part of a homeless ne'er-do-well who is adopted by =very= eccentric millionaire Sellers, whose philosophy is that every man has his price, and it is his game to find it. The title refers to the name of a newly-launched luxury liner (Sellers-owned) which has attracted the business of some of the wealthiest idle hands the world has to offer. Beyond that -- telling much more about anything that happens would be venturing into Spoilerland. By way of comparison, this has much the flavor of another Sellers movie, Casino Royale -- the old one, with him and David Niven and Woody Allen: as I say, just bizarre and psychedelic humor. The Pink Panther movies were examples of restrained decorum, in comparison!<br /><br />Why four stars and not five? Just because it isn't a GREAT movie. Sellers had a run of second-stringers --After The Fox, The Party, etc. -- and while this probably rates in that league, it is probably the best of them. It does tend, I think, to run a bit to simple silliness and flounders a bit at loose ends while waiting for the plot to catch back up to it.Good movie -- not a great movie.<br /><br />So definitely worth a watch, especially for Sellers enthusiasts -- I say that in distinction to &#34;fans&#34; who probably know this already!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The fifth book of the series did not disappoint as I got to see the return of some of my most beloved characters. Love  it and can't wait for the sixth!
B007B6T3K4|5.0|First time I heard something from Xandria on Last.fm, I was astonished to see that it was NOT Nightwish with Tara fronting. This bunch is every bit as good as Nightwish was, and more. Soaring, melodic, passionate vocals, deep ominous music behind, this is what doom metal is about.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|It is amazing going back in time and seeing &#34;Upstairs, Downstairs&#34;.  The story lines are so similar to the new &#34;Downton Abbey&#34;.  I love watching it.
B00CWV8TIU|1.0|It's too bad they don't have red stars for rating that would be negative because I would rate this a negative 10 or more.  If this is the best Hollywood can offer then I want a refund.  I was hoping the well-known actors/actresses in this would offer entertainment.  This movie was a farce and I can't believe I paid to endure this.  It makes me not want to watch movies/videos/tv anymore.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is the best series in a long time.  I can't wait to watch the next episode!!!!  Love it.  Love all the actors and actresses.
B002GIBVV6|5.0|Excellent condition.  Very prompt service.  This is a story my daughters loved when they were young.  A wonderful story everyone would like.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|My 2 year-old son loves this movie. Now that I have downloaded this movie to my device he sits quietly, and views his movie.
007174889X|5.0|I used this book throughout pharmacy school and I will continue to reference it during my career. This book is a great reference for any health care professional
B000001EHS|5.0|Great CD
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|great game for all ages, but it may crash sometimes like it is with me right now. you can raise dragons to try to have the most awesome dragon park ever!
B0063IH60K|5.0|The original spider is so hard to find, but this one is such a wonderful substitute. It's the only card game besides slap-jack I can actually manage to win!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I liked that the actors sang their own songs. I liked it more than the play. I liked how real they kept the story.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Enjoyable writing style, great story, great moral - what more could you ask? It's also a fast read. Nancy, Colorado
B009X011UQ|5.0|I've really put the cover for my Kindle Fire HD to good use.  Since I carry it with me so much it has really been great and I love the standing feature.
0307950689|1.0|The first half of the book is entertaining and suspenseful, yet I can only give it one star:<br />1. The suspense eventually leads to NOTHING!<br />2. The last 25% of the book is a lot of repetitive sermonizing and tiresome over-thinking.<br />3. The sole purpose of the book seems to be the promotion of Masons - how good, holy and well-meaning they are.<br />4. Dan Brown appears to be a Mason who purposely misdirects the reader away from the true purpose of the Mason hierarchy which is to create an army of subservient followers to be used at the whim of elite organizations senior to Masons.<br />5. The author also misdirects the reader away from the fact that top level Masons don't worship the concept(s) of God as espoused by the religions of this planet, but instead swear allegiance to a group of somewhat more advanced aliens  whose purpose is power and control over this planet's inhabitants and resources.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Touching story with witty humor that helps overcome the dark, tragic parts of the story. All woven together to make the book well worth reading.
B00B7VPKMY|5.0|Once again the Eagles fly high in a set that brings back fond memories of a bygone decade of great music by great artists all in one package at a great price
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This novel had be going through different kinds of emotions (angry, sad). I wanted to go through the book and handle things myself. Recommend reading it!
B00000G3I2|5.0|As a child of the 60's, I am have to say, this is a must for your DVD collection.  If you are a fan of the music of that period, you can't go wrong.  As far as the movie is concerned, it's also a must.  This is a great relationship movie, that doesn't fall into the category &#34;chick flick&#34;.  It's got wonderful scenes that include food, laughter, liquor and a couple of joints.  After all, these are people who experienced the &#34;Summer of Love&#34;.  I loved all the characters and wanted to be part of their weekend together.  It would be incredible to sit at the dinner table with this group.  Sit back, pour yourself something, and enjoy watching this movie.  I don't see how you can go wrong.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I don't want to get caught up in all the full immersion game stuff.  I wanted a simple app that allows me to play a simple and wonderful  game.  This one does it with style and visual quality that makes it one of my favorite get away apps.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|It is a great game to play. Good way to pass the time especially if you like to play BINGO. Good format for the kindle.
B008XKSW7M|1.0|One of the strangest movies I've seen! I wouldn't recommend it! I didn't like it at all! I like some of the actors in this movie, but this movie was horrid! Glad that I didn't pay for it! Ugh! Just horrible!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Love it and just bought Shift Omnibus Edition. I don't have anything else to say but need more words. words
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After page 1 I was hooked. I hope to see a continuation of this book soon. This was the type of book I couldn't put down. 5 stars!
B009NY43NY|1.0|I cant even express how disappointed I was with this book. The plot was totally predictable, and there were no good twists to keep me interested. I put up with the first half of the series even though the writing was horrible because the story was entertaining. This book has nothing to offer. Save your money.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|While I did not read the book, a movie like this, should be an individual interpretation.  With that in mind, this movie makes you think!  What if after our life is over, we get a second chance at doing what we are all put here to do;  acts of kindness that help build our world, not pollute it.  What if in doing kindness, we then find our soulmate, or re-find them?  Is this coincidence, fate, or by design?  Do we get second chances to perfect our souls?<br /><br />If we fail to achieve a certain goal in our lives, how many more times do we come back to achieve that goal?<br /><br />On the other side of the coin, are people who commit evil in this life destined to repeat evil in other times?  Can they break free of their eternal evil roles?<br /><br />So these are the questions I think this movie asks.  Watch it very carefully, or you will lose track.  And that would be a pity, as the lessons here are worthy of everyone's attention.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|The third installment of The Clifton Chronicles was disappointing.  Jeffrey Archer is a master storyteller, but he seemed to run out of inspiration in this one--and seemed confused as to bring the saga to a conclusion.
B001EN71CW|5.0|As a huge Sci Fi fan I was introduced to Firefly through a friend, I loved it from the first episode (Serenity pilot), the characters where believable and each had their own unique aspect and background to them. As a huge Star Wars fan I was hesitant to say at first that it was as good as Star Wars to me, but now I say that it is as good or even better than Star Wars! I would recommend this to not just Sci Fi fans, but to anyone who enjoys a gripping adventure filled with characters that just grow on you, and stories that will make you sit at the edge of your seat. Thank you Joss Whedon for bringing such a wonderful universe to life.
B00A8MGLAI|2.0|I should get my head examine. I should of rented this movie, before buying it.<br /><br />There was a lot that wasn't explain in this movie.<br /><br />The only thing good about this movie was the trailer.<br /><br />I would rent this movie first before spending 25 dollars.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|Another fun game ruined by greed. No game Ever needs to know what else is running on my phone, kindle, or tablet. If I'm not Playing online, the game should not require me to Be online. And, if I want to earn an online coupon for something, I'll sign up for it.<br /><br />There is a perfectly good free version of this game. Don't pay them to steal your data.
B0094LYBT2|5.0|This is a very good movie. It tells the story of Christ and emphasizes the importance of a strong father.
B00002N9ER|5.0|I mounted these brackets in my RV next to my door so i would always have my Maglite handy and know where it is in case of a power problem.  Easy to mount and they hold the light very tight.
B004G600A4|5.0|Received in great condition and loved watching this beautifull cartoon.  Played with great reception and clearity, will be a great treasure to keep.
B00CW665VI|5.0|WOW!  This book instantly earned a place on my favorites list.  Let me start out by saying that I had no intention of buying this book... I told myself I was just going to read the sample pages to see what all the fuss was about.  Once I started the first page I was sucked in.  I dare you to read the sample and try to resist this book.  I love that the book is written by a male POV.  He's a player and he doesn't mince words and he's not apologetic about it.  However he is just hands down HILARIOUS.  He is smart, and witty, and dare I say sweet in his own way.  The book was sexy and fun and intelligent.  It got a big fat 5 star rating for me and it is my new romantic comedy fav book... move over Wallbanger.. make room for Tangled!  Go one-click this book right now... I guarantee you won't regret it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I haven't had this much fun reading in years! Unique, interesting, edge of your seat crazy... Just do it. You may cry, but believe me... It's well worth the trip.
0062020897|5.0|An unforgettably brilliant spy novel filled with lots of surprising and exciting twists and turns and gripping raw emotion that keeps you turning pages and prevents you from putting the book down. Another absolutely wonderful story from one of the greatest storytellers of our time.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I got this App a couple of months ago and find myself using it all the time. I have it on both my Kindle Fire and my android cell phone. I password-protected both with no problem (you have to go to the menu option when you first open the app, not one of your notebooks). I'm a note-taker so having something like this handy is wonderful.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|I bought this CD with fairly low expectations. As not only a huge Cinderella fan, but a fan of the whole metal movement from the 80's and early 90's, the majority of releases from this genre of artist have been disappointing from the last 5-10 years really. There hasn't been many albums that I bought that I really loved. I'm happy to say that this broke the plethora of bad releases. So I'll give you a bit of a track by track review.<br /><br />1. Solid Ground-The album starts off with this great rock, bluesy song that immediately kick it into high gear and gives the album a really nice start. This would be a really good single IMO.<br />2. A Different Light-A little lighter than the previous tune. This song really showcases Tom's vocal ability. He sounds really good here. A true vocal shine for him.<br />3. It's not enough-Very Cinderella like. Just a great all around rock song.<br />4. Cold day in Hell-Another fun song that keeps up the tempo. Again, very Cinderella-ish. I love the harmonica sound in this song.<br />5. Thick and thin-The first ballad on the album. Tom's voice is really good here as well. Very nice ballad.<br />6. Ask Me Yesterday-It only picks up the tempo just slightly. Another ballad type. Very well done.<br />7. Fools Paradise-This song has a really nice tempo to it. Great production and just a fun song.<br />8. The Flower song-This was the first song I heard before I bought the album. It's very Rod Steward like. I figured the album would have been more like this. This is the exception. Not the norm. Great song though. Almost country in sound to a degree.<br />9. Mood Elevator-The heaviest song on the album. One of my favorites. It's just an all out balls to the wall song.<br />10. Welcome to my mind. Another very interesting tempo song. A fun rockin out song.<br />11. You showed me-Another ballad. A good song. Nothing crazy. But good.<br />12. Ain't that a bitch-I love this song. Very rock bluesy. Almost Rolling Stones like. One of the best tunes on the album.<br />13. The way life goes-An overall good rock song but not the best of the album.<br />14. Babylon-My least favorite song on the album. But even my least favorite is not a bad song. It's just not that memorable.<br /><br />Overall, this is a spectacular album that all fans of Cinderella, or even all rock fans for that matter, will enjoy. It was so much better than I expected it to be. I can't say much bad about it other than it took too long. Now, I just hope he takes this momentum and puts it toward a new Cinderella album soon. It's overdue!<br />But if you are on the fence, don't be!<br /><br />GO BUY THIS ALBUM TODAY!! IT'S WORTH EVERY PENNY.es on the album.<br />13.

B005GFPZYK|1.0|In the first 20 pages I thought this must be a joke - surely this kind of jingoistic nationalist pride is so 19th century? But no, I ploughed on through redneck drivel, and a unique combination of US arrogance and ignorance (saying the British speak English funny is just the most laughably ironic comment possible, but I know comments about the States and irony is overdone) and the boring banality of only killing about 20 in the 2nd gulf war because of 'pussies' in the 'head shed'.<br /><br />Good to know some see Blackhack Down as a documentary though.
B00BIRRDZ4|4.0|Dawes is a new band to me although I understand they have been around for awhile.  Their alternative folk rock sound and the lead singer's voice are appealing to my ears.  Just downloaded Stories Don't End and have already played it through several times and just saw them on Letterman last night.  They are appearing locally in a few weeks and am thinking about plunking down the $$ for tickets.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think that this game is awesome because you can save up money to buy cars and different maps  and you can upgrade the cars that you buy.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|This is the third Harry Bosch book I've read and it is the best yet. It is believable, fast paced and grabs your attention taking unexpected turns. There may be corrupt cops but it will never be Harry Bosch!!
B00CS65JS2|5.0|I first learned of the album when they decided to stream it for free and I immediately pre-ordered it.  It's absolutely amazing.  They brought back soul in a way that hits you like I've heard it did for those back in the 70's... and we're sober :)<br /><br />BUY THIS NOW.  If you don't like it... listen to it again... if you still don't like it there is something seriously wrong with you... so go smoke a joint and then listen to it again dammit!
B00C061I3K|5.0|This album has alot of metaphorical meaning in it. Daft Punk has always been very detailed when producing their music. They are taking a step back, but also moving forward as musical geniuses. While listening to this album, it shot emotion and good feelings through my whole body. I've always been a fan of Daft Punk. They give inspiration to other musicians that start off in their rooms messing and manipulating samples.<br /><br />If you just recently discovered Daft Punk, this is an excellent album to get started on. I recommend buying Alive (2007) right under this album, one of the best live sets I've listened to. This is another amazing album to add to my collection.<br /><br />Now we wait for a RAM tour!
B009MYARIK|4.0|Read this book if you're into fun summer reading that's not require lots of deep thinking. You can actually guess the ending especially if you already read too many Sophie Kinsella's.
B000S9MT4I|5.0|What can i say? This is a great product, well worth five stars. Very happy with it.<br />Three more words.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|My Taylor is enjoying the newest app of Angry Birds very much.  He loves to play the game and is glad he got it.

B0083ZRAJS|2.0|I guess it was alright but I thought it was a different Oz. It is the one from the movie I still have and I'll read it all later, when I have nothing to do.
B000JQU4TW|1.0|What can i say? This is not a great product, and not worth any stars. Not very happy with it.
159463176X|5.0|Just when I thought Khaled Hosseini could not top his previous novels, HE DOES! I cannot put this book down and feel completely rewarded with every word I read. His writing is not forced, his characters are believable and his storytelling is flawless.<br /><br />There are multiple characters in this wonderful piece, but each has a story and the descriptions Afghanistan and its people are brilliant. I admire this author and applaud his writing.<br /><br />50 stars on a scale of 1-10!!
B009FB3XTA|5.0|What can i say? This is a great product, well worth five stars. Very happy with it.<br />Three more words.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Starts off ok, but a bit too detailed. Strange topic; kinky sex. Did like the main female character even though wanted her to be more assertive.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|A quick read, great characters but the romance resembles too much like 50 Shades..hoping the next book cracks the demons,
B003YL4LYI|1.0|This series will never end. The first book was was a good read but I think a monkey wrote the last couple. You don't even need to read every chapter - he'll repeat it all in some other chapter anyway.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Enjoying this game so far! It's challenging but not too hard to keep it from being fun. Keep up the good work!!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This is one of the most well written and acted programs on television in a long time. I have to record several shows before I start watching. Edgy, witty and a fun ride. Great way to end or start the week.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|The game is amazing. The multiplayer is very competitive and fun. Try getting a kindle and putting this on your points for kindle. it's overall graphics and that crap is awesome. This game is worth every penny
0679805273|3.0|As a former reading teacher, I did not think this was one of Dr. Suess' better books. For young children it is too long and not as fun to read. It's difficult to hold a child's  attention for the entire length of the book and the content isn't special. The illustrations and rhymes are cute, and carries out a theme.
B001KZG99A|5.0|I was glued to my seat during the entire movie.  It was a thrill to watch it while enjoying my own snacks.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Works perfectly with White Noise.<br />I was pleasantly surprised about all options<br />I would highly reccomend this app.<br />I will be buying the ad free very soon.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|Cannot wait to see Iron Man 3.  It was a pleasure to spend some free time enjoying a great movie.
159463176X|5.0|A quick Google search will direct you to any number reviews by critics that can convey to you the mastery of Hosseini's storytelling better than I can.  I am not in a position to and don't care to comment on this novel's status as a literary masterpiece (his previous work has been criticized as too &#34;contrived&#34; and blah blah) but as pleasure read it is damn good. And not in the way I was fooled into reading books like My Sister's Keeper or A Million Little Pieces (haha remember that?) - the stories were complex and genuinely compelling. I couldn't put it down, but I had to at times, to reflect on the emotional intensity of what I just read.<br /><br />I can definitely say, at multiple times throughout the novel, I found myself simultaneously heartbroken and smiling. But not because the stories were disorganized and confusing and I wasn't sure how to feel - I'm pretty sure this dichotomy was exactly what author wanted to evoke
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|One of the DVD holding spots (the circle in the case that holds the center of the disc) arrived damaged, but the disc was fine.<br />Likely a manufacturer flaw.  Other than that, the items were exactly as described, and met all expectations.  Thanks :)
B001F7MSFM|3.0|Sequel to Hellboy, seems silly in its pretensions to the original. Yet it is a good movie, Ron Pearlman is the star.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Doesn't swear or anything. A really good book for ages 10-14.  I really enjoyed this book. I would suggest reading it.
B000127LW2|4.0|Nice sci-fi adventure that follows along it the &#34;Star Trek&#34; fashion. Good action, solid plot lines. Kate Mulgrew as someone other than &#34;Mrs. Columbo&#34;.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This app makes time consuming tasks go very quickly and accurately. I used it last night and it was a breeze.
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|Great non stop action, gets right to the point about what is going on. How different things are accomplished by different groups. Good for movie buffs who like action and it has Arnold &#34;Terminator' Schwarzenegger...
0547848412|5.0|sent to the PO Box i wanted. 3) it has the quality i expected, and the person who received it said more people is reading it.<br />Thanks.
B00A8MGIZG|4.0|Great movie, takes awhile to get into storyline but Tom Hanks and Halle Berry play several roles in this expansive tale about how lives intertwine.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|This was one of the best spooky shows I've seen in a long, long time. Storyline has more to it than most horror movies.
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|I like this movie even though it slow developing what the plot is. Tom Cruise and Rosamond Pike in &#34;A Thrilling Film&#34;.
0780624890|5.0|love the vips moives and action in and will buy more later on own 1-2 hope make more blades moives
B000AOEMXM|4.0|Supposed prequel to Star Trek, the show gives some background to how the Prime Directive and United Federation of Planets came to be.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|This is one of those movies I watch over and over again.  The story about persisting in the face of obstacles, adapting and overcoming,  is exactly what I need when I feel like crap.  This movie reminds me that good things do happen and I just need to keep swimming.
B00062IDCO|4.0|Nice sci-fi adventure that follows along it the &#34;Star Trek&#34; fashion. Good action, solid plot lines. Has Jeri Ryan too...
B0076DCT2G|4.0|While not his best John Corey book, I still really enjoyed this one. Lots of humor, but light on drama and action. Definitely not in the same league as The Lion's Game. I hope his next outing with these characters have more developed plot lines.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Great movie about looking for &#34;Silver Linings&#34;. Jennifer &#34;Katniss&#34; Lawrence in a different role is life-like as a person with bi-polar disorder.
0152164154|5.0|Well printed and produced copy. Hard cover is solid and well made. Inside paper and images are well done also.
B005S9ELVC|5.0|Real true to life story about life in Los Angeles in 1949. Josh Brolin Ryan Gosling, Nick Nolte, Emma Stone and Sean Penn star in this bio-pic.
B00AK77WPE|5.0|I love this concert, was great!. JLG is excellent latin compositor. I was there, I enjoyed it too much. His music is terrific.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Prequel to Lord of the Rings, this story gives some background to Bilbo Baggins adventures alluded to in in LOR.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|When I began this book I wasn't sure I would continue reading it.  The style was a bit off-putting but as I continued it grabbed me and I truly could not put it down.  The writing style became part of the story which turned out to be as good of a multi-layered novel as you'll ever read.  The WWII material appeared to be well researched and really put me &#34;in Berlin&#34; at that time.  A fan of historical novels will like this.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Even better on the tablet platform I will be playing this forever can wait to see new stages and vehicles maybe even a different driver hint hint do get<br />Me wrong I love Billy Bob...
B0033806MI|4.0|This one gives the reader a delightful insight to the  characters. Suddenly, you feel that you understand Percy a little more......He is no loner two dimensional
B000YRY8BG|5.0|This movie is excellent. Holds your attention the whole way through. Highly recommended. The actors are so believable. Don't miss it.
B002HML6Y8|5.0|The only reason I rate this high, and while I have it on DVD, I ordered Blu Ray, because the imagery of the movie blows me away.<br /><br />The sets, costumes, makeup etc- this could have been a classic horror from Universal if Universal had CGI in the 30s and injected the swashbuckling of Fairbanks into their horror classics
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|This is by far some of the best writing I have seen in a very long time. Can't wait for season 2.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|While I don't own a kindle, I shopped for a case that would fit my every need if I did. I was gift shopping and while there are many different cases out there, this this one looks great, feels rugged, and performs as expected. The video demonstration was an easy selling point. Needless to say the kindle user was extremely pleased with it.
B000FC11A6|5.0|THIS IS A FANTASTIC  BOOK....great historical perspective  of WWII with characters  related to characters from his baroque cycle books. very cool. make sure you read it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Wicked game, graphics are brilliant , just like having your own competition horse , can't wait to get enough gems to buy some new horses
B004J4WNL2|5.0|If you're the sort of person who gravitates to the sidelines at parties, shuns speaking opportunities and the spotlight in general, and wonders how gregarious people ever got to be that way, this book was written for you. And, as it turns out, not just for me, too, but also for between one-third and one-half of the American population.<br /><br />Here's Susan Cain framing her subject: \\"Our lives are shaped as profoundly by personality as by gender or race. And the single most important aspect of personality -- the `north and south of temperament,' as one scientist puts it -- is where we fall on the introvert-extrovert spectrum. Our place on this continuum influences our choice of friends and mates, and how we make conversation, resolve differences, and show love. It affects the careers we choose and whether or not we succeed at them.\\" And, of course, lots more.<br /><br />The popular misconception of introversion in America is that it's \\"somewhere between a disappointment and a pathology.\\" By contrast, extroversion has become what Cain calls the \\"Extrovert Ideal\\" in U.S. society, making the rest of us feel somehow guilty when we don't measure up. Cain takes on this misguided notion with a vengeance. In Quiet, she demonstrates how each of these two personality types has its own advantages and disadvantages. She makes a clear case for including a balance of the two types in any organization, the extroverts to push the limits and the introverts to hold them back from hurtling over the edge.<br /><br />The terms introvert and extrovert were popularized by Carl Jung in an influential book published nearly a century ago (1921). \\"Introverts are drawn to the inner world of thought and feeling, said Jung, extroverts to the external life of people and activities. Introverts focus on the meaning they make of the events swirling around them; extroverts plunge into the events themselves.\\" In Quiet, Cain details the many ways in which the two personality types differ in the ways they work, play, invest, love, and perform just about any other function common to Americans in the here and now.<br /><br />The distinction between the two types isn't hard and fast. For example,<br />\\"[i]ntroverts may have strong social skills and enjoy parties and business meetings, but after a while they wish they were home in their pajamas. . .  Nor are introverts necessarily shy. Shyness is the fear of social disapproval or humiliation, while introversion is a preference for environments that are not overstimulating.\\" Introverts listen more than they talk. Extroverts talk more than they listen. Still, the contrast isn't complete: these are tendencies exhibiting strong statistical correlations with distinct patterns of chemical interaction in the brain . They're not universal guides to behavior.<br /><br />Cain places contemporary views of introversion and extroversion in historical context. A century ago, during what she terms the \\"Culture of Character,\\" Abraham Lincoln was placed atop the pedestal of virtue. Today? Tony Robbins represents the ideal in the Culture of Personality. (Tony Robbins?! You've got to read the book.)<br /><br />Quiet is endlessly fascinating, with lengthy passages and sometimes chapters devoted to Robbins, Harvard Business School, Dale Carnegie, Rosa Parks, open-plan offices, Steve Wozniak, and other icons, fads, and trends of today's America. Throughout, the author presents the detailed findings of research in \\"personality psychology,\\" as the relevant field is called. She cites the jargon but explains everything in clear, straightforward prose.<br /><br />If you want to gain insight into who you are and why you act the way you do, read this book.

B000002VMD|5.0|sound track very good. I wasn't a whitney fan until I watched the movie Bodyguard. she sold me then as a good actress and now I enjoy her music not all but most of it
B009GEDP26|5.0|My favorite program ever - laugh-out-loud funny, poignant, and sensual.  The cast acts like one big family, one team - their acting is superb.  The guest actors have all been terrific.<br /><br />I own the entire series, the first such purchase I have ever made - and I have been around for awhile!<br /><br />Can't say enough about the beautiful, intelligent, sexy and savvy Stana Katic, or for the very funny, lovable, smart and caring Nathan Fillion.  Andrew Marlowe and his entire team at Castle deserve every Emmy ever bestowed, and every year!<br /><br />A definite plus for this series, for me, is the refreshing degree of respect and courtesy shown to everyone; In this day often a rarity. Stana and Nathan are originally Canadian - so am I. (and now a happy dual citizen).  To be courteous at all times, to show respect to all, is a staple of our upbringing. ( &#34;Please&#34;, &#34;Thank You&#34; and even &#34;I'm sorry&#34;, are second nature to us.)<br /><br />So THANK YOU for bringing so much pleasure to me, my family, and everyone I have now watching Castle. We all love it and will pass it on.  May Castle's success continue long into the future.

B008IGP8QE|5.0|My 9yr niece loves his music. She has rhaspody on her tab, but she still wanted this CD. She listens to these songs on her way to school on the tab and plays the CD on her CD player when she's in her room. She has an ipod but ipods are changing so fast, she's constantly repurchasing and downloading the same songs everytime she has a new tech gadget so she just wanted the CD so she can transfer music to any device she purchases in the future.
B0085KGGHI|5.0|It's been a long time since this show was done (1981), but its pairing of great musicians, plus appearances by Buddy Guy, Junior Wells, and Lefty Dizz, made for a marvelous night of blues.  And Mick Jagger's renditions of blues songs knocked me down!

B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I like this game never could really get into temple run but ironman 3 perfected that style of game for me at least
B00BDAP66E|4.0|I use this to manage my church's facebook page and it works real well.  I wish I didn't have to use a separate app to do it but that's just how it works I guess.  No problems using this at all.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great short video for moms.  It takes less than a half an hour and you actually sweat.  No cheesy music and I can even do it with my toddler.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome it is so worth the money<br />I would always play on Xbox BUT know I can play it on my tablet
B0000062FL|5.0|must have been a spiritual transition for Carlos and band, good cd but not his usual beat, Santana is the best so it's cool to take the journey with them
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great Show with great characters and awesome story lines.  After the first episode I was hooked.  So far it's a feel good show and the main character played by Julianna Margulies is nothing but a class act.
B000UOOT1W|5.0|this cd has all the great songs on it, good listening on every track, one of his best cd's by far
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I have been a huge Les Miserables fan for many years.  I really enjoyed this movie version and think all the actors did a good job with the music.
B00000J7J4|5.0|in his quest for change and life's answers I believe this cd was born/formed.  This cd is a great reflection of emotion, experiences and growth for Carlos and his band members.  His music is very reflective of the journey
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I am enjoying the CD.  It is very upbeat and I really like JT!  It has a good variety of songs.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|I love this game. I played it only PC and was thrilled to see it on kindle<br />It can keep me and my daughter busy for hours
B0078ZTWP4|1.0|I bought this light as a substitute to the Rayovac SE3DLN and expected the performance to be greater, due to the lumens claim of 300 and Rayovac's claim of 240. I'm no rocket scientist but if a product is advertised at 300 lumens, shouldn't it be brighter than a lantern with \\"only\\" 240 lumens, right? WRONG! I couldn't be more disappointed. The first thing I noticed was the handle on this model is much thinner and not as sturdy as the Rayovac model. If this handle were to disconnect while hanging, that would be the end of the light. Secondly, this light only has 1 led chip built into it, whereas the Rayovac model has 3 led chips and it's noticeable when you turn them on. The light is not nearly as white or clear as I expected and frankly, I'll never buy a knock off brand of lantern again. Stick to what you know and brands you trust. Rayovac, I'm sorry I left you.
B000088E6D|5.0|My Mom's a fan of him, so I bought this for her. She enjoys it. He reminds her of Frank Sinatra.
B005P3NPXG|3.0|Considering Seal became a \\"Mentor\\" on The Voice (Australia) this CD was a little disappointing. When you do a \\"covers\\" CD it's all about SONG CHOICE SONG CHOICE SONG CHOICE. The first Soul Sessions CD was great but this one feels a little flat. And it comes down to song choice. There are a few great tracks (\\"Wishing On A Star\\" and \\"Lean On Me\\" are particularly good), some just don't work as well for someone of Seal's calibre. Having said that, still worth a listen if your a fan of Seal.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|The book is well written and very compelling.  I found her story staying with me long after the book was finished.  That, for me, is high praise
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I loved playing the game but every now and then it would stop registering that I was playing and the game just quit.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|I want to watch this movie every now-and-then...maybe every four or five years.  I rented this from Amazon.com without any regret, and maybe renting this again in the future.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It's really fun and awesome game and I think you should try it out because it's super fun and wrong:)
B005LAJ212|5.0|Great watching this awesome show marathon style on DVD, was able to fold a lot of washing while watching this nail-biter!
B00C7DGRL4|1.0|The movie tries to hit you fast and hard, hoping that you wouldn't noticed how bad the story, characters and action really is.  It gives you the facade of a stylistic action/adventure movie, but it's a boring knock-off of other movies. For some reason, throughout the movie, it felt like it had potential for something cool - but it never delivers... just more of the same old garbage. If you want to waste an hour and a half of your life, go right ahead.
193609648X|4.0|Out of 30 patterns in this book I would consider making 10 (beaded lace shawl, bias miniskirt, chrysanthemum shawl, lacy capelet, granny triangle shawl, granny square purse, puff stitch cowl, shades of blue shawl (on the cover, amazing!), shell stitch tunic, strawberry lace shawl) and would mull over whether to do 4 more (chevron hat, bobbled hat, v neck pull over, sleeveless tunic). 14ish/30 is pretty good. I rated the Knit Noro book less than that, but the Knit Noro Accessories book slightly higher.<br /><br />Why do I like this book? I am not even a crocheter, I am a knitter, but this book makes me want to learn just for these patterns! Of the first 10 I would consider making, all of those are \\"distinctly crochet\\" patterns that knitting couldn't produce. Although they do look pretty advanced. The 4 I would question would be similar to knit fabric, so not extremely interesting as far as crochet goes. But probably more beginner.<br /><br />That being said, there still are the uuuum what? Noro patterns in there, which is typical. Engineer cap? Swirl tam? Nesting bowls? No thanks. It also looks like this book is less popular on Ravelry than the other Noro books, since there are less projects on there. But I'm sure that has to do with the knitter/crocheter ratio of users.
B0054W4JQK|3.0|Bought this book purely because it showed up in the recommended list in my Kindle. Started off really slow and I initially regretted buying it, I'm glad I persisted though because I came to quite enjoy it. Good enough read if you can get through the first few chapters.
B004SUWR2C|2.0|When I played the game for two weeks it quit working. Now I just get a blank screen and I can't download again. I don't like the way the hands switch on you without permission. Never saw that in uno before.
B0038LB3YK|5.0|Don Winslow, and particularly this book, are amazing. This is very much my style of book; action, twists and much more. The favourite part of my day was catching the train to and from work each day so I could read The Power Of The Dog. Some 'scenes' throughout are not for the faint hearted.
B005LAIHCM|5.0|I bought this for a gift and my son said he liked it very much and was glad I had ordered it for him.
B007KZY1YY|2.0|Only started reading this book because so many people were talking about it. Unfortunately once I've started a book I'm really bad at stopping; unless it's beyond terrible. Writing style is boring, storyline is predictable, it's just good enough to keep you entertained for short periods of time. Can't wait till I finish it so I can start something better.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The ending was so amazing best book so far can't wait to buy the third. Good for any age or grade
B00B1CGD5M|4.0|The band that got me into \\"harder-than-radio'able\\" rock was Slipknot, even though they had some radio hits.  I liked the low-pitched scream Corey Taylor could provide.  These days, aside from maybe Machine Head, most of the screams from the heavy bands are high-pitched (Killswitch Engage, All That Remains) and they are not nearly as melodic to my ears as the low pitch.  It just doesn't seem like many bands with the voices of Machine Head/Slipknot come around too often.<br /><br />Soilwork is kind of an in-betweener.  They have some high and low pitched screaming, most of it I find tolerable.  What really makes them shine is their excellent choruses--very catchy, melodic, and the dude has an actually good voice underneath the yelling (the choruses are also what make Killswitch tolerable to me, too).  I hope Soilwork can start a trend of not-so-high-pitched-screaming heavy scream bands and get that genre back in sync with how I like it.<br /><br />Only con here has to be that these guys should stop making music videos altogether.  Rise of the Sentiment is truly awful in video form.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Wow!!!  This game is a boatload of fun!  The graphics are top notch!  It is challenging, but not to the point of frustration.  A great mini-vacation for your brain!!  You'll love it!!

B000002JPA|5.0|I think this is the BEST Dream Theater album.<br /><br />The lyrics, the voices, the sounds, the theme and the whole feeling make this album worth more than a thousand images and words.<br /><br />Dream Theater has a lot of great music out there so, you may find your own favorite but, this is definitely one of their best and my favorite!

B001200MXW|4.0|\\"Peace Frog\\" alone makes this a must have for even a casual Doors fan. That California blues/funk infused hard rock sound driven by Morrison's vocals and a Krieger is at his peak and the late Manzarek is the rock solid foundation as always.

B0015DROBO|5.0|I read this book sometime ago and I consider it one of the best books I've read.<br />The plot is really amazing! Don't knowing where it would head from page to page.<br />It's so subtly made that combines a plot with a vision of the country itself. That which nobody talks about.<br />I highly recommend this book together with the other two of the Trilogy.

B00BGIBVP8|5.0|It was a funy movie anybody with kids would understand, especially teenage girls and guys that like cupcakes. I recommend this movie to everybody.
B000FCKGPC|1.0|I have dragged myself through the first half of this book and just don`t know if I have the endurance to go on.  I would pay twice the price for an abridged version if it actually built a bridge to a story worth reading.  Too many names for too many characters and too many characters with too many names.  Also too much descriptive detail that adds nothing to the story.  Some things should be left to the imagination of the reader.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|Solid research-based nonfiction book. Author Paul Tough writes in a way that appeals to parents, teachers, and education reform proponents in America. I recommend this book to all school administrators and politicians. Should be required reading in college.

B003DES8I6|1.0|Learn from my mistake and DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! It was beyond terrible. I love the first movie; it's easily in my top 5 all time. I put off watching the sequel for a long time because it didn't look great to me, plus I knew there was a good chance they'd screw it up. It's all cheesy jokes, poor acting, and a discrace to the original. Keep your love for the 1st in tact and avoid this total FLOP!!
B000VUCIZE|3.0|I am an unabashed athiest, and thought that reading intelligent discourse about the fallacies of organized religion would serve to relieve me of any niggling doubts about the possibility (however remote) of a higher power.  I was satisfied in that regard. But I also regard spiritualism, mindfulness and mysticism with the same skepticism I regard theocracy in the 21st century, and Mr. Harris's embrace of these philosophies to serve as viable outlets to a monotheistic society-at-large I found a little naive.  I was also troubled by the take-no-prisoners tone he took in his diatribe against Islam.  Granted, Muslims seem to have taken the moral high ground taken centuries ago at the start of the Spanish Inquisition, and they have a lot to learn.  There is no room for any kind of altruism or compassion in Islamic teachings, according to Mr. Harris's uncompromising view of Islam, and I beg to differ.<br /><br />Still, when he turns his attention to the brutality meted out to \\"sinners\\" in the days of early Christianity, especially against the Jewish people, the dialogue is well thought out, and a pervasive argument.  Most frightening, to me personally, is his spot-on analysis of the ways that vast numbers of thoroughly indoctrinated fundamental Christians have been able to gain a following in the halls of power, especially in the United States. The idea that there are so many ignorant men and women so secure in the \\"rightness\\" of their cause that they are getting the attention of cynical politicians, who will listen to any fairytale if it means the possibility of more money in the war chest and more votes at the polls is worrisome beyond belief.  We seem to be taking giant steps BACKWARD to appease the delusional and let them think they are advising the leaders.
B00BEZTMWW|2.0|Jackson masterfully adapted Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy into a trilogy of movies. That was appropriate.  \\"The Hobbit,\\" however, is a single volume, and more a children's story.  Like many children's stories, it has action and scares, but it always struck me as more lighthearted and less allegorical than \\"Lord of the Rings.\\"<br /><br />I suppose it is a matter of taste.  I can accept eliminating some scenes in a book when adapting it for film, but I have difficulty accepting inserting scenes and characters that the author never intended  to exist to expand a movie.  It seems not only extremely presumptuous, but also may let the director's ego and narcissism run rampant. I think that is what happened here. The cast are excellent.  Ian McKellen returns in a masterful performance of Gandalf, and Martin Freeman's Bilbo Baggins is convincing and enjoyable.  Richard Armitage's Thorin doesn't seem to be as empathetic a character as John Rhys-Davies's Gimli, but it's still a professional performance.<br /><br />The visuals are spectacular, but the story drags, and is presented as ominous prequel to \\"Lord of the Rings\\", something I don't think Tolkien had in mind when he first penned \\"The Hobbit\\". As spectacular as the CGI is, how many escapes across rickety, dilapidated bridges over deep chasms can anyone watch? I have already sold my copy on eBay.  One viewing was enough.

B004RJMUJO|1.0|It's A GAME.  There is no need for it to know what else is running on my device.<br />It's A GAME.  There is nothing so impopushingthat it should need to display an alert on top of other running apps.<br />This can be the result of only a few possible things -  lazy and/or inept programmers,  or 'evil' intent (data mining,  pushing ads).
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I really like the game. What I don't like is the cost of 10 &#34;bombs&#34;. I finally relented and bought (1.99) ten of them in order to get new words since the words kept repeating. After buying the bomb to get new words, I still got the old words. I hit &#34;get new words&#34; and in seconds 3 bombs were gone and words were still repeating. I finally got a few new ones. It's a good game if you like to draw, but who wants to spend $ just to get a few new words? Surely the developers of this game can find a more efficient way to keep people like me playing!
1400069807|5.0|This book was so good, well-written, easy to read, lots of 'case studies' etc., that I am surprised that it is not at the top of the NYTimes best seller, non-fiction list.  I recommend it to all who have any interest in food, corporations, health, etc.,

B00B5AP7NY|1.0|This film is a good film IF you haven't played the [[ASIN:B00BUSNS0U LEGO Batman 2 Super Heroes PS3]] video game. Of course, I am speaking about this from the perspective of an adult. I'm sure younger viewers will enjoy it. The film is comprised of the cut-scenes from the video game edited together with some new footage so it becomes a coherent story. But that's my take on it, it is a rehashing of video game footage. This is far different than past Lego films we've seen such as [[ASIN:B006JIL20Y Star Wars Lego: The Padawan Menace [Blu-ray]]] or [[ASIN:B00AXFK96M LEGO Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Out (Exclusive Minifigure DARTH VADER with Medal)]]. These films were entirely new footage and a new plot-line not associated with the video games. I, as an adult, would much rather have seen a brand new storyline and not a collection of cut-scenes from the video game.<br /><br />The release comes with a Clark Kent Lego Minifigure that, I think, shows how little effort they put into the movie. With \\"The Padawan Menace\\" we got a figure of Ian, the protagonist of the story. With \\"Empire Strikes Out\\" we got a Darth Vader with medal as seen in the film. This time we get a Clark Kent with exposed Superman S. Correct me if I'm wrong, but shouldn't a Batman film have at least a Batman character? I know, I know Clark/Superman is in the film quite a bit, but it's Lego Batman! At least they put out a figure not available with any set.<br /><br />Some commenters in response to my original review said the film did not deserve a 1 star, because it entertained kids and featured new material. I'm sure this is true. However, when comparing it with the previous releases we got robbed. A conservative estimate is that 60-70% of the film is game footage, that means we're only paying for 30-40% of a new, unseen special. It does feature several references to other Batman works such as Tim Burton's title sequence from the 1989 Batman film, which was not used in the game. But the majority of the references, again, were used in game.<br /><br />It might provide some laughs, but I don't think it's worth the money, effort, or time IF you've played the game and if you are familiar with the previous Lego movies.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is fun!! It's just as impossibly hard as the first, but definitely addictive. It's one of those games that you lose over and over again but you feel like if you play just one more time you can do it. Great game!!
193700788X|4.0|I never read anything in any of the books in this series that lead me to believe Sookie would ever leave her home in Bon Temps.  To the contrary it was absolutely apparent she'd never even consider it.  I wondered how the author would handle Sookie's love affairs with vampires since they are generally much more long-lived than even humans with some portion of otherness in their makeup.  I imagined Sookie would age gracefully over the coming handful of decades with Bill living in his home next door to hers, spending as much time as he could discreetly protecting her but with no rekindling of any romantic involvement between them.  It never occurred to me that Eric would remain with her.  Sookie clearly saw him as he is and looked forward to whatever time they'd have to share.  Eric, and Pam, would come into and go from Sookie's mortal life until death finally took her.  It never crossed my mind that Eric would turn her unless some tragic accident or horror was killing her and she found she didn't want to die a mortal death after all.  I've always liked Sam and could understand his shapeshifting abilities being very exciting.  And Sookie's feelings for Sam had always been the kind to last a lifetime.  Sookie lives where her heart is and Sam is there along with Jason and her young cousin whom she planned to always be there for as  he grows into his abilities.  We've all read the books.  We all know this.  This last book in the series was as good as most of the others, not as good as some others.  The ending, and by that I mean the last bits of the last chapter, just stopped.  I don't believe someone could read the last book and understand the series, it's just not a stand alone book.  Frankly I don't get that Sookie and Sam will be together -- I simply don't.  They finally make love.  But then Sookie backs off, wanting to take it slowly?  I gotta say that Ms. Harris seems to have just written a few closing sentences and sent it in, finalizing her contractual agreements.  The book's written well up until the end and then it's just hurried out the door, so to speak.  Another chapter or two would've been more filling, more fitting for me personally,  That lack of attention affected my rating of the book.  It was alive for me, as usual, and then it felt like I'd been suddenly awakened from an interesting dream I'd never recapture so it could be played out.  I've never enjoyed a book series more than this series.  I've enjoyed another equally but never more than this one.  I have them all and will re-read them here and there over the coming years, including &#34;Dead Ever After.&#34;  It's been Charlaine Harris' creation all along and I'm grateful for every word she wrote.  I'm not disappointed about any of the characters, only the lack of finesse used to close the series.  I'd been trained to expect better by the very same author now hadn't I?  Read it and see what you think!

They do use a lot of inappropriate words that are offensive. The movie is based on slaves it is horrible how African-Americans were mistreated, that part of the story is of course heartbreaking and sad that our country treated people in such a manner.  Great movie worth watching. thank you!

1476733953|4.0|I downloaded this e-book from Amazon.com to my Kindle Fire. The author Hugh Howey did a good job writing this Novel. I was drawn into this e-book right away as I started reading it. There are a lot of technical aspects to this Novel but it is not technically overwhelming.  I can see why this Novel is appealing to a large audience.  It is a futuristic story with a raw appealing quality to it. I did get caught up in the story. The story had an allegory of the cave (by Plato)feel to it. I have purchased all the rest of the e-books in this series and am looking forward to reading them. I plan on reading all books published by this author. There were a lot of characters in the story and there are a couple of typographical errors in the e-book version. I have and would recommend this book to a friend.

B008602KQI|4.0|The movie, for the most part has stuck to the novel.  There were a couple of things that I think were missed but that  always happens with movie renditions of books.  It's good entertainment and if you already read the books it will give you a motion view of what you read in the book. I don't know about you but book to movie conversions seem to be rushed in the story telling and lack detail. The movie is good ,but I recommend you view it with an open mind if you already read the novel.

0062059963|5.0|This book was amazing! I read it in one sitting over 6 hours.<br /><br />With such a strong first book to the series, I wasn’t sure Cass will be able to deliver as strong a sequel- but I was totally blown away!<br />The story evolves in this book really nicely and things I’ve been wanting to happen for a while finally did.<br />Just like in The Selection, the characters were really nicely developed. We also got to see a little more into the other contestants’ personalities in this sequel and even got a peek at the prince’s darkest secrets, which I really liked.<br /><br />I honestly cannot contain myself for the next book! 2014 cannot come any sooner.

B008JFUOVI|1.0|Every summer, theaters are seemingly filled with sequels - desperately trying to recapture the magic of the original, not to mention break box office records.  However, it's quite unusual for a trilogy to be released over the span of four years, unless they were shot together.  In 2009, The Hangover was the breakout hit of the summer and currently sits atop the film charts as the highest grossing comedy of all-time, yet instead of focusing on the quality of the story, the studio opted to cash in on the popularity of the first film by quickly releasing a sequel in 2011, The Hangover II.  Met with negative reviews, The Hangover II was basically more of the same, so the news of a third film being green lit was a bit of a surprise.  In any event, here we are - in the summer of the 2013, and Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis have reunited for one last run as \\"The Wolfpack\\" in The Hangover III.<br /><br />Todd Phillips (The Hangover, The Hangover II) is back in the director's chair once again as The Wolfpack - Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) are on a mission to track down Chow (Ken Jeong), who recently escaped from prison.  When a drug kingpin, Marshall (John Goodman), is desperate to locate Chow and the gold he stole, Marshall kidnaps the Wolfpack and forces them to capture Chow and deliver him and the gold back to Marshall or their friend, Doug (Justin Bartha) - who is being held hostage, will be killed.  Heather Graham, Mike Epps, and Jeffrey Tambor also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />From the very beginning, writer/director Todd Philips said he was going to use a completely different template for The Hangover III - and sure enough, he did.  However, some characters are not meant to be tinkered with so dramatically, especially in the \\"conclusion\\" of the trilogy.  These characters, that many of us have come to know and love over the last few years, are hardly recognizable in this film - although quite of bit of time of this third film is spent showing flashbacks to the first two films, clearly trying too to tie these characters and their actions together in one big happy circle of continuity.  Sadly, Mr. Phillips has apparently lost his feel for these characters, making Alan and Chow more cartoonish and outlandishly stupid than usual, while making Stu and Phil borderline irrelevant.  It's pretty clear to say that the direction of the plot is easily visible, but it's just not supposed to be a Hangover film.<br /><br />The first two films in the series are based on the premise of The Wolfpack having to find someone that they lost - and to an extent, the third film is spent searching for an individual, also.  However, all of this usually takes place after a drug-laced night of partying, which includes a variety of amusing interactions - whether it is a tiger in the bathroom, a tattoo on someone's face, or a baby in the closet.  So, the main problem with The Hangover III is there's no hangover, and without that hangover, there's very little amusement.  This story jumps right in with Alan being the focal point, now off his medication and more deranged than ever - followed by a kidnapping by a drug boss that happened to be mentioned by name in the first film (which, of course, leads to the first of several flashbacks to the first two films).  Then, The Wolfpack are kidnapped, forced to have a bunch of uninteresting interactions with the not-so-funny Leslie Chow, followed by Alan's lightning fast love story.  In essence, The Hangover III is a poorly written script with bad dialogue and relatively zero memorable moments.  Honestly, it's shocking how poorly executed this film is, so much so that most viewers would be perfectly fine with a forth film just to set things right.<br /><br />The bad news about The Hangover III is that 98% of film is spent simply going through the motions and waiting for something to be funny.  However, the funny never comes - at least not until the final scene.  Like the previous films, The Hangover III also ends with a wedding, so without spoiling anything here, you'll just have to guess which one of the single cast members will be tying the knot.  Enter: Melissa McCarthy.  For those that don't know her yet, Melissa McCarthy really made a name for herself in the hysterical comedy, Bridesmaids, along with her CBS comedy, Mike & Molly.  Aside from the final scene of The Hangover III (which we will get to in a moment), Melissa McCarthy steals what brief scenes she does have.  In the event of a Hangover 4, and it's hard to imagine it not happening at some point, it would have the potential to be a complete laugh-fest if she were given a main role - since it's pretty clear after this film that Zach Galifianakis and Ken Jeong are less than amusing in their new leading roles.<br /><br />Even though The Hangover III is atrocious, the final scene of the film (which is about a quarter of the way into the credits) will make it all worthwhile.  This post wedding scene will have you borderline crying from laughing so hard as you walk out of the theater.  It really is quite astounding that one scene can make an hour and a half of poor dialogue and stupid jokes worth the price of admission - but sadly, that's the case here.  If the film could have led with this scene and gone on from there, it would have easily rivaled the original film.  But, some things just don't work out the way you want them to.  Just give it a few years, and The Hangover 4 will have a green light.<br /><br />Overall, if you've enjoyed the first two films and you're already emotionally invested in these characters, you'll want to see this film regardless of what anyone else tells you.  However, if you are the casual movie-goer that enjoyed the first film and simply tolerated the second - feel free to skip this one.  You won't be missing anything and there's certainly a plethora of better films to watch.<br /><br />FINAL GRADE - D<br />FNDNreview.comne.

B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I hate it when they go to the school dance and the cheap toilet paper is also Amy school. I wish it would be better even though I gave it 4 stars
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|This movie was so all over the place that it made little sense.  They were telling many stories at once, representing different timelines, or so they said.  It really only felt like 2 timelines.  \\"What, that sounds familiar.....I have heard that before.\\"  That was about the only line that tied anything to a previous life.  Otherwise it was like trying to read 5 books at the same time.  Horrible execution and even worse concept.
B006M4F67A|4.0|I enjoy Mahjong but was unsure of some of the items that matched.  That was my only complaint.  Otherwise it was fun and lots of different setups.
B00BCZUAE8|5.0|Love this c.d. :) I highly recommend this album for any Justin Timberlake fan!  Every song on the album is sure to be a hit.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I absolutely love this film!!! It's hilarious, has great singing, hilarious one-liners and cute guys. I was so guttered when the NZ release of the DVD didn't have the bloopers and deleted scenes I had heard about so I just had to buy the US DVD to see them and the disc works perfectly on my multi-zone DVD player. It sucks the Ultraviolet won't play in my region but at least the disc works here :-) 5/5 stars!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I love the description in this book by Anita of the non-physical.  It is the best description I have read, ever, and totally aligns with what I had come to understand, after my work with the dying and other glimpses I have had over the years.  The focus of this book is not on cancer (thank goodness) it is on self love and connection to Source (whatever that is for you)<br />I totally am in sync with the authors views that the solution to cancer is not through medicine.  I too have long held the view that all this cancer awareness is exactly what is causing it.<br /><br />This book is beautifully written with soul stirring descriptions of the authors NDE with as near a description as possible with the limited use of language.<br /><br />Thanks to the author for remaining true to herself and her new found beliefs (despite no doubt rocking more than a few peoples belief systems based on fear)

B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This is a great game. My son and I really enjoy playing the game together. We are always thrilled to come home after a long day to see what dragon is hatching. I have even spent real money on gems.<br /><br />My only complaint is the amount of money it takes to buy the really cool dragons. I won't spend that much on a game just to have a cool dragon. I found a book on breeding tips which I am almost tempted to buy.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|So beautiful and extremely helpful! 5stars!It helps in every way, I know how much talk time and music and video and standby time I have used and more!! Thumbs way up!
B008OW1S3O|5.0|My boyfriend heard Fitzpleasure on KCRW and knew I would love them.  I have ever since.  I was incredibly surprised to hear Breezeblocks on a local radio station that usually doesn't play anything but top 40-ish and 80's songs.  Now it seems they are gaining popularity.  I wish them the best, I just hope they don't overplay the songs until I no longer love them.  Best of luck!
B00B8WXG9G|4.0|Paul Anka's \\"Duets\\" is a delightful disc.  While not every track hits the mark for me, most of them do.  And there are some delightful gems here.  The opener \\"Walk A Fine Line\\" with Michael McDonald's vocals alternating with Paul and George Benson's jazz touches sways with a lovely samba-inflected beat & delightful Spanish guitar, \\"There is a place where black turns to white, it's good or it's bad, and wrong turns to right.\\"  \\"Find My Way Back to Your Heart\\" is a strong pop song.  I had read a professional review saying how old fashioned this music is, but this track is great contemporary pop to my ear.  Patti LaBelle joins Anka on the gorgeous \\"You Are My Destiny\\" with LaBelle's voice sliding over Anka's in musical ecstasy.  Peter Cetera joins Paul on vocals on a number co-written with David Foster on the sentimental ballad, \\"I'm the one who said we're through, I can't live without you anymore.\\"  Anka's pairings with Michael Buble and Leon Russell are also sweet.  This is a strong set from Paul Anka.  Enjoy!

B00C33M2EE|1.0|This CD also comes with a DVD with all of the songs as a video performance. I have not yet seen the DVD so this review is limited to the CD only.<br /><br />I decided to buy this CD on a whim upon seeing the \\"Star Wars Cello Duel\\" on Youtube. (Note to self: do not evaluate the quality of a musical piece solely on viewing a music video.) The referenced music video was exciting and intriguing.<br /><br />I thought that this CD will also contain exiting and intriguing music. Upon its arrival I popped it into my car's CD player and listened on my morning commute. My background is not in music criticism but I like to listen to a wide variety of music from classical to hip hop and heavy metal if it's good. This CD contains the not good kind of music.<br /><br />Listening to this CD I couldn't help think that these guys were bunch of low paid, 3rd chair, minor city orchestra instrumentalists who decided to make the big bucks by making \\"exciting\\" variations of the classics. The end result seems like they are trying too hard to be George Winston or Yanni, but falling very short compared to the latter artists accomplishments.<br /><br />At the time of the purchase, Amazon did not have the ability to sample listen to the pieces, and so I bought the CD blindly (or is it deafly). Dumb mistake.<br /><br />Again, I haven't seen the DVD. Maybe all their songs are better when simultaneously viewed and listened to on the tube.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|if I'd known that across 5 books, all combined into one omnibus edition that the author didn't bother to bring a single thread of the story to conclusion, I'd have saved my time and money.  this is really more of a starter book for a series rather than an actual series and it apparently took 5 books to get there.  but rather than the intended effect of leaving me wanting more, I'm left wondering just how much I'd have to go through (both in terms of spending money and time to get through books) to get a complete story.<br /><br />all in all, I'm quite disappointed.

B000JIN3J8|5.0|very good early adaptation.  Very British.  Good performances, good production, good writing.  I've watched about every film or mini-series version of P&P.  This one compares well.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This film was a great rebirth to the Star Trek franchise. It has a few technical problems in the Star Trek universe, but the feeling of the world that Rodenberry created has held true.

B002Y0TGOU|5.0|JJ Abbrams has bought back the interaction between the characters that made the Star Trek series famous. Great film! We had just gone to the 2013 film and there were several time line questions I had about the story. Watching this was entertaining and filled in those &#34;holes&#34; in my memory from 2009, when I saw this in the theater. Great re-launch of the Star Trek franchise. Looking forward to the third movie already! For &#34;Trekies&#34; this has several references to the 1960's series to test your memory!

I frequently related segments of the book to friends and co-workers because it was so moving and fantastic.<br />It is comforting and reassuring. I would recommend this to almost everyone. Dr. Alexander gets a bit technical at times but it is definitely worth having to<br />read a sentence a couple of times to understand it.  Great book!!
B00881PTRC|4.0|this is a good game but some of the words are very hard, it helps build your vocabulary though and the animations are fun
B009B8YZIK|5.0|I picked this movie up from a Red Box because I was bored and wanted something to watch that I haven't seen before. This movie was near the bottom of my list of things to watch because I am not a fan of the Halo games, so I didn't really hold out much hope for the movie. I expected it to be basically like Starship Troopers (which was a great book that got turned into a disappointing movie) and I did not have high expectation for it at all.<br /><br />To my great surprise this movie is excellent. It is far closer to Enders Game than Starship Troopers, and the movie shines because of it. The majority of the movie follows a group of cadets (probably aged around 13-16) who are the children of the military elite as they progress through military school. I am guessing that this all deals with the \\"lore\\" of the Halo series and technically takes place before the first game, because it didn't have anything to do with the video game I remember playing (which to me is a huge plus). Instead of fighting aliens the children are learning how to fight \\"Insurrectionists\\", a group who's purpose is never explained but left enticingly nebulous. The 10 or so minutes of the movie that did include the main character from the games (Master Chief) were the least interesting portions of the movie but didn't do enough to make me drop down to 4 stars.<br /><br />This was a wonderfully written movie, good dialogue, good coming of age themes, dystopian overtones, it is well paced (something many big budget theater release movies can't seem to get right), well acted (which is a accomplishment considering that 90% of the cast are teens), and engaging.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Halo then I can't really advise you if you will enjoy this. If you are like me and are either not a fan or are ambivalent about Halo as a franchise but enjoy things like Enders Game or Old Mans War then do yourself a favor and pick this movie up. You will be pleasantly surprised.

B00BWJARHO|3.0|A bit of a let down, there were noticeable inconsistencies in the plot. If you are going to try and meld another episode in an instant classic at least get the story as close to the first lord of the rings where the story premise was first seen by everyone. I am a big L.O.T.R. fan and it the Hobbit just did not hold up to the hype.  Ian Mckellen was not a very convincing in his roll of the younger version of the elder Bilbo baggins . I will put it in my collection but where as I will pull out one of the trilogy often, this one not so often .

B00CW665VI|5.0|This is such a hard review to write when all I can think of is a million and one positive things to say. I loved everything about it and wouldn't change a thing.<br /><br />Drew may be my favourite book character. Ever. I know, I know what you're thinking.. how is this possible? I don't know either but he just BLEW ME AWAY. He was sexy, charming, witty, a little (ok, a lot at times) arrogant but above all he had the biggest heart.. even if it was buried way, way down. All he needed, to give his heart the spotlight it deserved was a woman, and only one woman was going to be able to do that. Shame it wasn't all plain sailing.. Honestly, before Kate, Drew was a complete and utter a-hole when it came to women and maybe I should have been offended and 'all for women' but I couldn't help but support Drew. He was just so painfully honest that I found myself thinking.. \\"well yeah, he has a point really.\\" - I loved it.<br /><br />  \\"Somewhere along the line, she's become more to me than just a set of legs I want to crawl between.\\"<br /><br />Now Kate.. she was just wonderful. I usually don't really have any feelings at all when it comes to the heroine. They either really annoy me or I just don't care about them enough. Well, not with Kate. She was just so damn perfect for Drew in every way. She was hard working, driven, confident, didn't take Drew's crap and she is so damn considerate of everybody's feelings that it just warmed me.<br /><br />  \\"She's magnificent - angelic - gorgeous. Pick a word, any effin word. The bottom line is, for a moment, I forgot how to breathe.\\"<br /><br />The two of these together were just so effin funny. They complimented each other in every way. Kate would take no crap from Drew and gave back to him just as good as he gave. They work together and very early on are forced to work together on a project.. think sabotage. It all just had me howling with laughter. That isn't all the book is about though.. yes there a lot of jokes but there is a lovely, sweet but hot love story here. It was just a perfect kind of read.<br /><br />I wish I could mention every plot line because there really was so much I loved about it - Mackenzie, Drew's niece was one of my favourite things. I love a book where the serious, hot, alpha hero suddenly turns to mush because of a little girl. It's just the most adorable thing, and Drew and Mackenzie's relationship was no exception. \\"And for God's sake, don't let her watch Cinderella. What kind of example is that? A mindless twit who can't even remember where she left her damn shoe, so she has to wait for some douchebag in tights to bring it to her? Give me a frigging break.\\" Another thing I loved? Mackenzie's swear jar.. every time somebody (usually Drew) swore around her, they had to put a dollar in her jar. Let me just say.. this girl's going to be one rich young lady. Just so damn funny, every time. There are too many secondary characters to mention, but all of them had me laughing and wishing I was part of their little 'gang'.<br /><br />So anyway, over all this read was perfect and just exactly what I wanted. I didn't realise when I started that it was going to be a series, but I am so glad it is. I am in no way ready to say goodbye to these characters!<br /><br />  \\"I'm going to make you so happy, Drew Evans.\\"<br />  \\"You already have. After this? Heaven's going to be a major disappointment.\\"ly, sweet but hot love story here. It was just a perfect kind of read.<br /><br />I wish I could mention every plot line because there really was so much I loved about it - Mackenzie, Drew's niece was one of my favourite things.

I am in no way ready to say goodbye to these characters!<br /><br />  \\"I'm going to make you so happy, Drew Evans.\\"<br />  \\"You already have. After this? Heaven's going to be a major disappointment.\\"

0142420891|4.0|Great book, however a little predictable, the first book was a good leader and this one a good follower and closer. i would definately recommend this to some of my younger relatives and friends, althought there is some strong language, its nothing they dont hear at school already.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|This case is sturdy, great quality, and everything it says it is.  Suggestion when putting the Kindle in put the camera on the fold side this way you can charge the Kindle while in landscape mode.  Only reason for 4 stars is no stylus holder and no portrait setting other than that this case is EXCELLENT!!!
B008ODZEQ0|4.0|Eating dinner at a restaurant run by a man obsessed with making the best sushi on the planet will cost you at least $300.  Be sure to book well in advance.  That's what happens if you are a national living treasure...you can charge whatever you want and someone will be willing to pay it.  I prefer to relax when dining out, something his customers have trouble doing as Jiro watches every bite his patrons take.  The story was fascinating but it made me uncomfortable because the man is such an over-the-top perfectionist.  Not your warm and fuzzy type.  Ten years for his apprentice to learn how to make tamagoyaki (fried egg)?  Please!  Nevertheless, an interesting look into the life of a human whose world is totally consumed by doing one thing better than anyone else.

B00AW0KGYI|5.0|I love this saga. Was not sure I wanted to purchase just because of the extra minutes, love the released version first but the extra minutes to me were worth it!!
B00C061I3K|1.0|I have been in love with Daft Punk since the first time I heard Da Funk where it took the Funky beats of Disco and combined it with Techno.<br />The Discovery album never leaves my car because I love listening to it on long road trips or when I want to set the mood with Something About Us.<br />I remember over playing Human After All cd till I got sick and still playing it.<br />I loved listening to daft punk mixing their past and present with their Alive 2007 concert.<br />I love using the tron soundtrack to test out my speakers from \\"The Game Has Changed\\" or \\"Rinzler\\" or \\"Fall\\"<br />But this new album does absolutely nothing for me.  I understand its goal was to bring us a new sound by incorporating the 70s... but to be honest Daft Punk has always brought a little bit of the funk and disco to their albums.  Whether its \\"Burnin\\" or \\"Da Funk\\" from Homework, \\"High Life\\", \\"Voyager\\", \\"Something About Us\\", \\"Digital Love\\" or \\"Crescendolls\\", from Discovery, \\"Make Love\\" from Human after all there is always a funk sound.  But this album has gone over the top and to be honest with all the \\"imported talent\\" that daft punk tried to incorporate into this album it reminds me of Daft Club.<br />[[ASIN:B0000TI3Z0 Daft Club]]<br />While Daft Punk is present I feel that the artist have ruined their signature sound almost as bad as Kanye West did with Stronger [[ASIN:B000TZI5UI Stronger]]<br />This album is a huge let down.  When I heard about this album I was expecting the sounds that they used in Tron but to be evolved and better.  I really wanted something that I would listen to \\"one more time\\" and keep listening to over and over, I wanted more of their traditional sounding songs like Harder Better Faster Stronger.<br />But to be honest I only hear the daft punk I've grown to love in one song \\"Contact\\" and even then they ruined it with the astronauts talking reminding me of Satellite by BT.<br />Next time daft punk... stay a Duo... and don't ask for other artists to join and ruinyour sound.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|LOVE HIS VOICE, VERY TALENTED ARTIST. Only knew 2 songs before purchase, but like most on this CD. Well worth the price.
B000UDNBQW|4.0|Wish there had been some exposition - maybe a prologue - to provide more historical background. I think adding some of that context would have helped me understand some of the dynamics and motivations of the characters.
1455526959|5.0|Another Connelly great mystery. The characters are very real and the writing it very good. I recommend it to anyone who likes good stories and mystery/crime.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Good book for a reading group... it will generate lots of discussion around the different ways of parenting. How much should parents defend/protect children? Are parents capable of being objective? What happens when two parents have different points of view about children's motivations and training -- what ways do parents reconcile the views?<br /><br />Loved that the story didn't end with a clear resolution for all... so much like real life.

B002DOSBMK|5.0|This is not my first time reading the Drizzt series but the adventures of the drow elf and his companions has enraptured me since I was a young man. I have read this series many times over my 2 1/2 decades of life and I never tire of the story itself. It is so masterfully written that I can actually see this book playing out in my head as if on a television screen and I get so caught up in the battles that to this day I still cheer out loud when Artemis is foiled again or one of the gang puts down a ferocious monster... If I had to recommend any series in my life it would be this one as not only is it a great story it is also a very creative way of teaching Honor, Integrity, Strength and the belief that anything is possible if you have the heart to go for it.
B001B3MCQK|5.0|This man is the best.  I love it.  I can't believe I had never heard of him before.  The radio plays the same old same old.  We need to get over it and play the good stuff.  Wow, is all I can say.

B004UNX1LS|2.0|I don't have & have NEVER had a facebook or myspace account. that being said I can't set up playlists or send questions without a facebook page. playback quality & sound are fantastic on my Kindle Fire but I have to select each video one at a time, just like youtube. also I can't seem to play videos from one artist, it always picks the next song based on my last selection.<br /><br />overall it's a good app that could be way better.
B008Y1YFNU|5.0|From start to finish, The Connection by Papa Roach rarely lets up with the hard edged, guitar driven intensity. Combined with awesome melodies, catchy riffs, choruses, and verses, most songs here are a blast to listen to.<br />I was not expecting so many 5 rated and 4 rated songs to be on one album, but here it is. A Highly recommended, metal album with plenty of gritty vocals that aren't afraid to scream with intensity when appropriate.<br /><br />Favorite Songs: 5/5<br />3. Where did the Angels Go<br />4. Silence is the Enemy<br />7. Give Back my Life (best song IMO)<br /><br />Most of the others are 4/5 stars in my opinion, and if I was generous, some even earning a soft 5/5. There are a couple 3/5's here that are decent.<br /><br />If they keep their next album this intense and melodic, I'll be there. Incredible job Papa Roach.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is great for all ages! Very addictive! Wish it was easier to collect gems though, or at least be able to buy them with your coins.
1616550414|5.0|This book is a love letter to those who love zelda, have zelda theories, and those who want to know more straight from the creators. It has detailed back-story on different characters, events, and locations in the game. It even puts a few fan theories to rest (unless you're determined to be right no matter what) The best part for me personally about this book has to be one thing: Concept art. You look at all the things that didn't make it into the games and makes you wonder what could of the experience been like if the designers got their way 100% of the time. Even if all the detail of the games, characters, and mythos isn't enough for you (man you're greedy) they included a full original manga attached at the end. So even if you have a causal interest in the Zelda series or you're a gamer that's never cracked open a book you may want to give this book a chance. It's big, has lots of pages, and has girth so you won't feel cheated that you're reading instead of playing. 5 Stars
B002N57KG2|5.0|Nice old movie. Realized they raced to the Portifino Hotel in Redondo Beach. Had just stayed there in March so it was a hoot to see things in the move that we saw in person! Funny movie!

When I played Cooking Dash.. it kept asking me to buy the extra levels.. finally I did and I played all the extra levels.. then deluxe came out and I purchased that.. is that the same?  did I purchase the same thing twice?  I can't seem to see a difference
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Anyone who likes fantasy and magic will love this book. Its characters have lots of depth and the main character is excitingly bold and clever. The author develops a believable world which we find out secrets of as the main character boldly seeks them out. I excitedly await the third book of the series.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I downloaded this app in Nov 2012 and have used it almost every day sin e then on both a 7&#34; Kindle Fire and later a Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34;.<br /><br />I was prompted to write this review because I was looking for a Pro or paid version (because I use it so much and could do without the adds) and I noti ed the same negative and/or confusing comments that almost made me not get it in the first place!<br /><br />And no I am not a developer (hardly!), or friend of etc. - but it did make me wonder do they ever update these reviews?  I'm not saying that others didnt have negative experiences - but to at least say that I have used it extensively on my Fire and it has worked exactly as its supposed to.<br /><br />I am not thrilled with the ads in  the app- but they are placed pretty unobtrusive and no porn or &#34;push ads.&#34;  Neither did I receive any alarming updates.  Maybe I have been lucky or maybe the problem had been fixed.  That 's why I was surprised to see the same negative reviews.<br /><br />WHAT IT DOES DO:<br /> (1) connect you to YouTube through its home page and allow you to search out and download videos and music.<br />(2) Pressing the &#34;Downloads &#34; icon at bottom of the page will show you a list of your downloads.<br />(3) Then you can either choose TubeMate as the media player or the installed Amazon music player to watch video or music.  It will also offer up any other media players you have installed on your device if you would prefer.<br />(4) When downloading, it prompts you to choose the video format you want or need for your device.<br />(5) The app also has a mp3 converter (will ask if that is what you want).  It tells you that they will be actually mp4 files - but that has not made any difference to the media players I 've used (Rocket, Meridian,  Avia).<br /><br />You don't really need a separate media player with this app unless you want to create playlists.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that it does occasionally &#34;freeze up ' when I stzrt DLing alot of songs one right after another - which is easy enough to avoid. I, I'm not totally sure that this isn't something of a Kindle issue,  nut st any rate it's simply a matter if choosing either &#34;wait &#34; or &#34;force close &#34;.  The worst that's happened is that I may have to re-download this item.<br /><br />I hope this was helpful.

B008XKSW7M|1.0|My wife and I had our first baby six months ago and while she was pregnant, we nearly went to the theater to see this movie. Luckily, we didn't, and only caught it on Amazon Prime because it was free.<br /><br />I found this movie to be extremely superficial. As a comedy, it wasn't funny. Neither of us laughed once. We didn't expect a \\"comedy\\" pregnancy movie to include a miscarriage in the middle of it, and I am damn glad we did NOT see this movie when my wife was expecting. So maybe it's a drama? Nope. Every other line is a lame attempt at bathroom humor. Don't get me wrong, I like bathroom humor. I just don't find people talking about \\"nipple cream\\" funny by itself, but the writers seem to think just mentioning \\"nipple cream\\" is funny. Maybe I'm wrong. Just in case...nipple cream nipple cream nipple cream.<br /><br />I'm a little surprised this movie has so many 4 and 5 star reviews, but I can see where the one-dimensional plot line and character development has mass appeal. This is not a movie that will tax you mentally. Unfortunately, this means the humor is pretty plain, and the characters are flat. It was a good movie to have on while we did the dishes and fed our baby. It would also be a good movie to have on while you took a shower, blended a bunch of smoothies, or wanted your in-laws to finally go home.<br /><br />Come to think of it, we did enjoy the movie as we took turns making funny faces at each other whenever a really bad joke didn't work. I guess another benefit is that the movie has given us a false sense of superiority from watching it. I certainly feel a lot smarter than any of the characters in the movie, or any of the writers who wrote it. This might be a reason why so many people like the movie as well. If a friend of mine had a bad day and did something really stupid at work, I would tell him/her to watch this movie. I'm sure they would feel like geniuses afterwards and feel better about themselves.
B000002KB8|4.0|This is a classic Black Sabbath album featuring their murky blues based heavy metal sound.  Certain groups, like Led Zeppelin and The Who had been developing a louder and heavier sound before this; but this album is the first that truly sounds like what heavy metal would become.<br /><br />The first half of the album is great, it's the Sabbath with the metal riffs and Ozzy's sinister lyrics.  The second half is a blues based jam session; this leaves something to be desired.  Black Sabbath was great, but they certainly were not Cream.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|This book is awesome. This book is great for those who wish to understand the history of RHCP and get a closer look of the life of the band members. I think this is a book that all RHCP fans should read. The RHCP Bible, man.
B000002H97|4.0|This is considerably more radio friendly then anything Metallica had put out before it.  All the elements of classic Metallica are here, heavy grooves, slash and burn guitar solos and James Hetfield's shouted out lyrics; but here they're more polished and refined.  There are some surprises, harmonized singing and strings both make their appearance on their album for the first time.<br /><br />A couple of the songs seem to drag; this was previously unheard of for Metallica, but overall the album is solid.  There's no better introduction to Metallica than this album.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|This concept album, right from it's name, is a tribute to the memories Daft Punk have. The robots are paying homage to the roots of the dance music genre, as well as the time period that they came from. From simple songs of passion like \\"Get Lucky\\" to decadently intricate songs giving glimpses into human and robot nature like in \\"Within\\", \\"Game of Love\\", and \\"Touch\\"; the writing and visuals I get when I listen to these songs send me into a self-analitic spiral of thought. And the ironic idea that robots, beings we associate with being cold and emotionless, are trying to remind us to \\"Give Life Back to Music\\". There are some songs that send me into the deepest of trances, like that of \\"Beyond\\" and \\"Giorgio by Moroder\\".  Of course, this album has tiny faults, but for what it was going for, it nails it with the greatest of ease. It's such a bold album, so good, that I know I'll listen to it over and over again, and for years to come. Is this their greatest achievement? No. Is it a big achievement? Heck yeah.  I recommend this to anyone who'd want an idea as to how to create a concept album.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Muse's follow up to their (US) breakthrough album demonstrates that they're no one album wonder.  The album is big, sprawling and operatic; which they do wonderfully well.  They also manage to sneak in a smaller, quieter number with \\"A Soldiers Poem,\\" showing their range.  The lyrical content about conspiracies, corruption and aliens were probably more in vogue when the album was released than today, but they still work and still fuel the soaring music.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|This movie was nice. I like Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones together. They are a great pair to watch.

1476704163|4.0|I purchased this book as a gift for my daughter but I did take the time to read through it. I was quite surprised how interesting the star's life is. The content is brief but interesting and the pictures are great. I do wish there was more written content as it seemed that the majority of the book was photos and some of the content was graphic. This book does make a nice coffee table coversation piece. A good purchase if you are a fan.

B000MD9UJC|3.0|If you have the normal AA mini Maglight, you know they can be convenient but are not very bright. I ordered this conversion that went in quite easy and seems to be a little brighter than the light was before, but not much. You get a whiter light and less focus and that is about it. The flashlight with this conversion is not as bright as the flashlight app you probably have on your cell phone. It’s good to have in a pinch but if you don’t already have a mini Maglight, spend some money on a good flashlight that puts out more than 30 lumens.

B0053TMP24|5.0|Like all the other Percy Jackson books this book is impossible to put down for even a minute! You should read this book
B004J4WN0I|3.0|The plot is very interesting. Very original--or at least for me it was very original since I've never read anything concerning druids. Atticus, as a main character, is very entertaining. Being inside his head as he rambles on and on about this and that beats being inside the head of a whiny, vapid 17-year-old lusting after a vampire/werewolf/fairy/[insert supernatural creature here].<br /><br />My only gripe with this book was all the exposition. Yes, I understand there is a lot of lore to be explored. I mean a LOT. But Atticus' constant expounding of this lore became rather tiresome rather quickly especially when there are times where he would literally just upchuck the names of a number of supernatural creatures all in the same paragraph. It made enjoying the book taxing because I literally had to google half of the names to see how they all fit into the plot. Honestly, I think the book would've done just fine introducing Atticus, his ragtag Scooby gang of a vampire and werewolf lawyer team, the main antagonist (who is apparently the Celtic god of love go figure) and a couple of nameless minions but instead you're treated to a separate book's worth of gods, goddesses, witches, druids, Tuatha Dé Danann and Thor and their century's worth of political dodgeball.<br /><br />Besides that though, the plot was consistent and straightforward. Nothing too heavy; I was surprised that the entire novel literally revolves around a sword--and not in a Lord of the Rings epic-fantasy journey way but rather in a &#34;you've-got-what-I-think-is-mine-so-now-I'll-beat-you-up-for-it&#34; sort of schoolyard brawl way. A light, breezy book. Good for a day's read.

031603441X|5.0|Keith Richards is famous for his amazing guitar playing, song writing, and not-quite-so-amazing singing, but he is infamous for having been on celebrity most-likely-to-die lists for 10 years in the 80s, and when he didn't, they realized he wasn't going to.<br /><br />His autobiography, Life, is a perfect match for his colorful and storied life.  This sprawling book begins with his birth and ends with his mother's death in 2007.  In between is a rollicking roller coaster ride that takes through the ups, downs, twists, turns, backspins, and more of Richards life.  From his early days, plucking away on his guitar, listening to the greats of R&B on records, to the heady heydays of the Stones early success to the bands temporary dissolution in the 80s, to their renewed vigor in the 90s and onto today, Richards covers it all.<br /><br />Richards spends, as to be expected, quite a bit talking about his drug habits.  But these are really a side show to adventures of touring, cutting albums, writing and playing music.  Richards works with a Who's Who of musical greats during his career.  Often just getting together to jam.  Of course, there is a quite a bit concerning his love/hate relationship with Mick Jagger.  We also see through his 2 marriages and other relationships, the challenge of having normal relationships.  But Richards never makes excuses or ask for pity when things are down.  Indeed, he wants us to celebrate the messy, complicated life he has lived.<br /><br />What comes through is an unpretentious guy, who despite or because of many, many close calls with the grim reaper, has a great love of music, family and friends.  And drugs (legal and otherwise).

1611761921|5.0|The reader of this book was fantastic. Each individual character was so different. The story kept us in suspense until the very end. Highly recommended!
B006OT03BM|5.0|Great Trilogy, awesome 3D effects lovely full HD details and the sound it is so realistic, nice packaging, fully recommended
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is amazing I love it so much it is adicting.  people should get this app it is so cool
B001AJ09JW|5.0|This movie was very intriguing, thrilling, and chilling. I didn't expect some of the twists And turns.  I am glad to finally have this title oh blu ray!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I don't usually like these games but this one was awesome. I felt like I was in a dark room unlocking the secrets of the Universe. Great graphics and challenging puzzles. Get this game, you will not regret it. Please make more!
B008JF8O9M|1.0|does not work from kindle fire unless you pay for the app. the option didn't show up before the download
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I truly enjoyed this last installment in the Hunger Games Trilogy.  I am very excited to see the second movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is okay compared to pc but still better than Xbox although all it needs is red stone<br />I think everyone should buy
B005HED11Y|5.0|Unlike what Lucas did when he digitally remastered Star Wars and ruined several scenes, the Remastered versions of Star Trek doesn't touch the storyline but does clean up the space shots to today's standards of effects.  I grew up with the series on TV both on NBC and later as reruns.  I still love knowing how they used track mounted cameras and models to do all the shots.  Matte painting is a lost art but well used in Star Trek (TOS).  But at least with the Remastered series, I can show my children (born after TNG premiered) what the old crew was like.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|David Baldacci is the master of the conspiracy novel and keeps his readers guessing where the next plot twist will lead them.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The author gave you an imagined incite of what a person with Alzheimer would feel since they are unable to express themselves. Everyone should read this book.
B0089LOG02|5.0|A very interesting book about a little known period in American history.  The author skillfully weaves the stories of two orphan girls.  The first is a  girl sent to the midwest in the early part of the 20th century on one of the many &#34;orphan trains&#34;.  The second is a girl caught up in the &#34;foster child&#34; system of present day America.  How their two lives become connected makes a fascinating and heart  warming novel.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Not sure why I didn't buy this the first time I saw it.  It makes me laugh every time.  It's a great go to movie when you want to jest be entertained.
0062200909|5.0|Very nice layout. Good stories. Again - a treat for a Hobbit-fan! This was also a gift and we couldn't have found a better one!
B0001I562I|5.0|Okay, so I assume this is supposed to be a kid's movie and I'm a 63 yr old grandma but this is such a happy/feel good movie that I watch it a lot!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|What can i say, you have to watch this.  From the casting, the scenery, the plot and the excitement, i just love this series.  It is addictive.  Even my hubby is addicted and that's saying something.  I've never seen him like this over any tv series, he usually doesn't watch much tv at all.
B006TVQTHW|5.0|My brother uses the Antec Three Hundred Two and it is a great case. The mesh front is great for blocking dust. The best feature in my opinion is the easy access door on the front of the case. It makes adding new fans and components really easy. I don't really like how it looks, but it is pretty classy and very practical. Would definitely recommend it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the walking dead and have been a big fan since the beginning.  Great viewing.<br />Have always thought the episodes are just a tad short, wish amc would make it one hour long.<br />Loved the development of the characters.  Shocked at the end to the season, don't know if i like the governer storyline in the end but it got me thinking about season 4.<br />If you liked season 1 and 2, season 3 is a must watch.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|Overall the movie wasn't too horrible, but when I think of what this movie should have been, I just downright refuse to accept this movie as being a good one. As soon as they announced that they were splitting \\"The Hobbit\\" into three parts, I knew immediately not to pay full price for it. I used some Amazon Credit to stream it much much later.<br /><br />My List of complaints. The things that just destroyed the entire movie for me,starting with the worst.<br /><br />-3D:<br />The biggest gimmick to ever grace the film industry. At first I was open to the idea, since they were actually producing the movie in 3D rather than doing a quick post-production deal to make a quick buck. But this movie reaffirmed my distaste for 3D. It completely destroys good cinematography. What should be epic, beautiful, meaningful shots, angles and scenes, become these bizarre, cartoon-ey, annoying events that don't fit well into the grand scheme of any film, all to make things \\"pop out\\" at people.<br /><br />-CGI:<br />Way too much CGI. Wow. CGI definitely has its place in a movie, but this movie used it wrong, and excessively. In fact, they used so much CGI I'm surprised they even bothered filming the movie in 3D at all. Most of the gimmicky \\"pop\\" scenes were CGI anyways, so why even bother using the camera when it was just going to be done on a computer anyways? Why were ALL of the Orc and Goblin characters CGI? I get it for the Trolls, the Giants and orcs in large numbers, but why in the world couldn't they come up with a handful of decent costumes for at least the main Orc characters like Azog and the Goblin Chief in Moria? The CGI orc characters were just bad. They looked bad, they moved really bad and I had to look at them over and over. It is a far-cry from what Peter Jackson did in the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movies. Maybe in the future with better technology this can be pulled off, but for now, there really is no substitute for good lighting, well-crafted sets, props, costumes and make-up, stunts and real outdoor scenery. All things that made the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movies great, and \\"The Hobbit\\" had few to none of them.<br /><br />-Three Parts:<br />Obviously, three movies made sense for \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" because there were three 'books'. Three movies for \\"The Hobbit; which was a single book and much shorter than any of the LOTR books, makes absolutely no sense at all. As a result, we got a movie teeming with boring, dragging filler material. The subplot with Azog is lame and boring, and doesn't really fall in line with the real story. I got really annoyed with reading his pointless subtitles very quickly. Radagast was given too much time and too major a role. I liked seeing an interesting character that played virtually no role in the books, but they took him too far to use him as poor filler material. I didn't mind too much of the back-story and lore-type filler, but overall it really takes away from the story to artificially make it 3 times longer than it should be. Being concise was part of the beauty of the written work. Short, easy to read, easy to follow, but still rich and entertaining. Too bad the Movies won't reflect that aspect of the story.<br /><br />-Story problems and Miscellaneous:<br />I am usually quite supportive of creative adaptations by film-makers on existing stories, which is why this falls at the bottom of my list. To be honest, I didn't find most of the deviations all that bad. Radagast's appearance is actually a nice touch, though they took it a bit too far. Some back-story and lore scenes that didn't really appear in the book were a nice touch in my opinion. A few things bugged me though. I really didn't like their deviation from the book in the troll scene. I didn't like how they handled the Moria scenes. (Finding the Elven swords was not accurate, the goblins' reactions to the Elven swords was too downplayed, the fact that Gandalf arrived fashionably late when he should have actually been there the whole time, etc.) The orcs' and the trolls' dialogue was just not done well. Now that I think of it, the fact that they had enough dialogue for me to criticize is a complaint in itself. The voicing was bad, and frankly, they had too much of it. The Goblin Chief giving long, well-versed monologues, cracking wise and singing and stuff just didn't really fit at all.<br /><br />-Conclusion: Overall the movie was Ok, but its mediocrity is what made me dislike it so much given the movie's potential. I love Tolkien's works, and I absolutely loved the LOTR movies. I was excited for the Hobbit, especially because Peter Jackson really did do a phenomenal job with the LOTR trilogy. Apparently though, he decided to get greedy and lazy and pump the movie(s) with lots of filler, gimmicky 3D and excessive, mediocre CGI. It was just downright sad to expect the magnificent story, scenery, cinematography, action, costuming and careful CGI of the LOTR trilogy films, then get 3 hours of this bizarre, boring, computer generated, gimmicky, cartoon that is only part 1 of 3. I don't think I can stomach the thought of watching another 6 hours worth of \\"The Hobbit\\" movies after this crap. In my wildest dreams, I never would have thought it would be so easy to botch \\"The Hobbit\\", being the most concise, interesting and riveting story of all of Tolkien's works. Yet Peter Jackson botched it. Very sad.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|A must watch following season 1.  Highly unusual for a series to be just as brilliant as the first part.  Loved every minute of it.  Great job of building the story lines and the character development.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|This is a great movie for family watching. Very funny and will keep both children and adults laughing throughout the movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wasn't sure if I would like this book or not.  I just saw a preview for the movie and wanted to read the book before I saw the movie.  I ended up loving this book very much and would recommend it to all!!  A little slow at times, but well worth it to get to the dramatic ending.  What girl doesn't love a love story!!!  Great book... can't wait to go see the movie now.
1423101502|5.0|My son was very pleased with this purchase! he has just about all of the books except a few! I've never heard of this until he asked me to buy him some! i just love that he loves to read
B009LDXQGC|5.0|Really like this group, good lyrics and good instrumentals. Don't want to scare young people off but I'm 62 years old and this just good. But I like a lot of the new music coming out these days... Try a bit of all music you might just like it!
0887431453|5.0|I chose this book for my 4yr old child and other daycare children, it helps them out drastically!!! They will be well ahead of the other kids in their class once they begin kindergarten
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I thought the first season of American Horror Story was awesome, and couldn't wait to see how they would continue the series. I couldn't have been happier! In the first and second seasons the writers of this series actually manage to surprise me! Most shows these days you can pretty much guess what's going to happen next but not this one! I also love how KARMA plays a huge role in this show, it shows how horrible what goes around comes around can be!
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Take several movies, bounce and cycle between clips from all of them, and you've got this... uh... movie, if you can call it that.  Great actors, great special effects, but no real connection to any of the stories or characters.  I was extremely frustrated with the clips that had them talking like Jar Jar Binks, couldn't understand half of what they were saying.  This movie was almost as painful as having a tooth pulled without any pain killer.  Even if I've never had said event occur, I have now.  Extremely frustrating and disappointing.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|AMAZINGLY AMAZING. This is the best book I have ever read. I love it so much. John Green is an amazing author.
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|Having seen several of the 3d Movies offered, I have to say that this movie was worth the price. It had good amount of action sequences that worked well with the 3d aspect. Several parts had me and my family jumping due to the clever use of effects. The story is a little bland, but I would still buy this over again if I had to. A great family movie.
1742200508|4.0|I was quite impressed by this travel guide. It held a wealth of information that would be very useful to anyone traveling to England. There is a lot to sort through, but I believe it's better to have too much than not enough, so this certainly didn't disappoint. If you're planning a trip to England and want to get an insider's look into the various sites, restaurant and attractions, this is definitely a great guide to purchase.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I would recommend this game to anyone it's fun I love it. I play it all the time :) LUV IT
0316172324|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  While I believe he's a bit circular in some of his logic, he makes some interesting points.  However, at the end of the day, hard work and 20 years of e pertinence allow you to go with your gut.
B000AP04NI|5.0|I saw this on Broadway in 1943. I had never seen a musical before and was really knocked out. This DVD version is exactly as good.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Great beginning very suspenseful and entertaining ending was a HUGE disappointment not worth all the suspense to be let down in the end
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|I'm not normally a fan of novellas. I prefer to have time to get to know the characters. The world. Sanderson does a wonderful job of creating engaging, meaningful characters in a very brief time. This story is definitely worth the $2.99
B006GWO5NE|5.0|goes bad you would have to replace an expensive charging head and cable. With your new system only the bad item has to be repaired.
B00003CXB6|5.0|I might be the only person who loves almost every &#34;part 2&#34; movie that I've ever seen.  I have no expectations going into them, which is what separates me from others, and leads to far less disappointment.
B004IK9SQ0|5.0|This is one of most complete textbooks textbooks on  onthe use of the human mind. I love the simple truth described by this man ahead of hi time.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is so much fun, I'm horrible at it but they still made it where I could enjoy it.
B000JQUZCI|5.0|Nothing like I expected. I never read this book before, but expected a story of a man who created a monster. Yet, this story is that and soooooooooo much more!
B00007G207|5.0|Originally bought the film for the musical score which is very haunting and delightful.  But the movie is one of the best &#34;arty&#34; films I have seen.  Very poignant and moving.  Long movie or at least it felt long but it manages to totally immerse the audience in the story.  Highly recommend for those who like quiet, thoughtful, artistic films.  Not a shoot-up, car-cash in sigh.....
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Saw this movie in the theatre with my child, and the film pushed all the right buttons for me--when I wasn't laughing out loud at all the video game references I was shedding a tear for Ralph and his relationship with Vanellope.  The blu-ray transfer is first rate, and the extras are extensive and entertaining.<br /><br />But forget all that--if the short film \\"Paperman\\" doesn't touch you right down to your soul, you aren't human.  It's a perfect animated film.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a very great game. I like how you can complete goals to earn invest points, energy bolts I guess and city credits.
B000002OX7|5.0|This 1971 release sounds a lot different than Tommy (1969) and indicates how much the group had developed in only a few short years. There is certainly no shortage of popular songs on this album and the track listing reads like a greatest hits list. Although culled from a larger project that was shelved (Lifehouse), there is continuity to the collection of songs on Who's Next, which is a personal favorite.<br /><br />The album was recorded in fits and starts (the process is nicely detailed in the liner notes) with the end product being a definitive album by the group. Come to think of it, along with Tommy and Quadrophenia (1973), Who's Next defines the Who's mature sound: a mixture of hard rock, a smidge of progressive, and dynamics that range from soft to loud.<br /><br />I love the use of synthesizers on the album (mostly VCS3 and ARP 2500) and electronic processing, which lends the music a fairly distinctive sound. On the downside, I am not a fan of the (lyrically) silly tune My Wife (John Entwistle), which is really at odds with the remainder of the material. This same sort of thing drove me crazy with ELP.<br /><br />The production quality is (was) outstanding and the remastered CD does not fiddle with the original sound too much (at least based upon my distant memories of the LP). The sound of the drums is best described as thunderous, and there is excellent separation of individual instruments. The liner notes are very detailed and include an essay by Pete Townshend and some notes on the album by a rock critic.  The extra tracks are pretty cool and I have to say they are actually of interest.<br /><br />All in all, this may very well be the Who's finest moment.  A classic by any measure, it is highly recommended along with Tommy and Quadrophenia.  These three albums find the group at a creative peak.
B003U51D58|5.0|Just getting around to watching the series Lost and so glad I did. I was able to<br />watch them several at the time without the suspense of waiting one week to the next or one season to the next.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Thanks,for this app just backup everything sometimes when updates looses data , happened to me once for the rest it work  wonders
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|My kids enjoy this app so much! I will look for more angry birds downloads when I can! Fun! Fun! Fun!
B007TKT2SK|5.0|How much easier can it get? HTC Inspire and Samsung Galaxy S3 both like it. It's a keeper for sure. So get it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is very fun and there are very many fun games and activities to play. there are many different things to do
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie portrayed raw, true, gut wrenching emotion and has you on the tip of the couch leaning in and grabbing at your heart and your gut. A family vacationing in Thailand when the tsunami hit; a true story of their fight to survive and search to find each other in the chaos afterwards. I am deeply touched and awakened to what happened over there after seeing this. I have 3 boys, as does the family in this movie; so I was especially touched.
0553801473|5.0|The book came just as described and in a timely manner. With the addition of the boxset for Books 1-4, I'm very happy to have bought it from Premier Book Dealers. If I purchase any books in the future I'll definitely look for this name, I advise others to do the same.
B005MYYFTG|1.0|When package arrived, DVD case was empty! It says Used, Very Good. Did they mean that the case was &#34;Used and Very Good&#34; ? So disappointing. Amazon live chat took care of the situation.
0345529057|5.0|As I mentioned in another review, boxset came just as described and in a timely manner. With the additional purchase of the fifth book, I'm very happy and lucky to have bought both from Premier Book Dealers.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Like the previous Hunger Games book this book is especially exciting to read. I recommend this highly! The adventure surrounding this love triangle has great buildup and a great ending. I would reccomend it to whomever enjoys exciting books and great romance novels
B0026IUXO2|5.0|I was always impressed by Queen Elizabeth I, learning about her through the history courses at the college and watching several movies on Henry the VIII.  Elizabeth has turned England into one of the most powerful kingdoms in Europe  and at the beginning of her power England was weaker kingdom.  That woman was extremely intelligent and I am impressed by her personality and intellect. Kate Blanchet plays her role with great mastery.  Always love historical pieces, speeches, portrayal of religious and social circumstances in England at the time.
B004WR125O|4.0|Its a nice option to listen to your music from your home PC. EI I-tunes library or what ever other music or internet radio. Doesn't stream video.At least I don't think so
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Unbelievable account of pilots in WW2 and the story that brought them together forty years later. This is a great book.
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|This is a reverse match three game with a retro (8-bit type) feel to it. The reverse part is instead of moving a single object up-down-left-right one space to match three or more, you have to move the whole column up, down, left, or right as many spaces as needed.<br />You're also racing the clock to make certain types of matches in order to progress through the dungeon (window at the top), based on which obsticle is in your path next.<br />On my Samsung Galaxy SII phone, the columns and rows overshoot the target, so I run out of time making matches line up by holding down on the row or column. This is a problem, because the time spent with my finger over the graphics is time that Should be spent viewing the play board and planning my next move.<br />All in all, the small file size and lack of invasive permissions makes this game a hopeful ($1.99?). Ten Million is a game I'll try to get more hooked on, pretty OK for FAOTD.<br />I don't think the 5-star reviews are dev's friends, same app on Play store has as many mixed and 5-star as Amazon's.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|THE MUSIC IS TOPS, BUT YOU NEED TO GET THE VIDEO TO REALLY ENJOY THE PERFORMANCE. I AM PLANNING TO SEE THEM IN PERSON, WHEN THEY COME TO TAMPA.
B00425S1H8|1.0|I bought 2 of these and neither of them worked for my application.  I am using it to control a power supply.  I was able to open the port once and communicate with the power supply but then couldn't open the port again unless I rebooted the computer.  I thought maybe I had gotten a lemon but tried the other one and it worked exactly the same.  I borrowed a Cables Unlimited USB to RS-232 with a FTDI chip and it works fine.
B0043RSK3K|4.0|Great reading!  Some of the assumptions are a little over the top, but most everything is dead spot on.  The US Government has been undermining the third world for a long time and now we wonder why som many people dislike us?? Read this and find out why.
0981951244|5.0|The book I go to multiple times a week.<br />Was able to see him live and it changed my perspective on my business.
B004SIP88Y|5.0|I loved this movie and with the discounts you give to everyone and the amazon gift cards that I get from family and friends, I was able to get this one and put it in my collections.  Thanks for great shipping and getting me the movie long before the delivery tines.  Will definitely be purchasing from this seller again.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|For me this was most pleasant experience with King's book) Unlike most his books which cause almost paralyzing terror this is a life novel with only scary end (or one of the ends).
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|best game iv played so far extremely addictive cant stop playing. I might need help!!! dude its stuck to my hands I cant eat!! wt* I'm gonna die
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Both my daughter and I love this game....we love competing to see who can get the stars faster. Love the graphics, love game all around
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I love this game..very addicting...I do wish more shadow cards for the htgs were given..I've played for months at a time, and never saw a shadow for the htgs...I eventually had to trade for them to be able to complete and move on...come on BB, give us a reason to keep playing, just don't take our credits and chuckle!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I enjoyed this sequel! It had me up late hours of the night, not being able to put it down.  Very well written and empowering as a survived of abuse. I'd recommend this book over fifty shades any day.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am still sitting and cant move.  I have just finished the book. Dont remember the last time i was so engrossed. Definitely will reread it to be with heroes again...
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Don't be thrown by the cancer-angle. Green masterfully navigates this topic by producing amazing characters worth rooting for. A pleasure to read. Recommend to anyone who loves books and thoughtful introspection.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THIS MOVIE.  GLAD TO FIND IT. A LOT OF STORES DO NOT CARRY A GOOD VARIETY OF OLDER MOVIES.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Great game. Addicting. Would have given it a 5 Star rating but there are a few bugs. They need to fix the reniging of credits and cash. You win so much but sometimes you don't collect it. Fix that and maybe add a few more shadows in a room and we have a winner. 4 STARS!!!
B0071XO8RA|3.0|This review is for the collected works, volumes 1-5 of the Wool series and therein lies a potential problem.  I found the book well written, great story line, decent character development but too drawn out.  Very seldom do I skim but found myself hitting the jump to next chapter button on my Kindle more than a few times as the book came to an end.  Entire chapters began to be devoted to single events that dragged on for me.<br /><br />Now, I suspect when it was purchased as a serial novel, the tedium was not nearly as noticeable as readers were anxious to answer the cliffhangers from previous releases.  Unfortunately, those cliffhangers don't really build because you just turn to the next page.  Part of this, IMHO, is the authors need to have some \\"heft\\" to each serial release figuring no one will buy just 50-60 pages, even though that might have been all it needed to tell that section of the overall story.<br /><br />I would still recommend the book as it takes a completely different view of a dystopian society and, thankfully, no vampires - I hate vampire books!  It couldn't have been all that bad because I've already purchased chapter 6 of the series, mostly because it is a prequel to the omnibus edition.
B00CTT9646|1.0|I had so many issues with this film.<br /><br />First how is khan an Indian guy, white?  They cast the whitest most pale dude they can find.<br /><br />Second, why do people keep defending this crap movie saying alternate universe. It's not, its an alternative timeline.<br /><br />Why is Spock yelling khan. Why is Scotty a clown. Why is bones always just pissed.<br /><br />Why didn't they get rid of the lens flares? Didn't they read the reviews from the first film<br /><br />Why rip from wrath of khan? There's so many TOS episodes with material to revisit<br /><br />Only good thing was seeing robocop in the movie

159514188X|3.0|I needed a book to pass the time on a long flight and this fit the bill.  Not too long and drawn out and a rather interesting topic/scenario.  While I greatly disliked the antagonist Hannah, I was glad this issue was broached in a way that would beget some self-reflection on the younger generation who would graviate towards a book like this. Not very far removed from high school myself, I recall several instances where similar things had happened to me or close friends of mine and none of us fully contemplated suicide.  Granted, millions of people have wondered what would happen if they were gone abruptly and whether or not they'd be missed. Since suicide among teens has reached an overwhelming number these days, it's important to discuss it from the angle of the deceased. Not that I am excusing it but many of the instances in which Hannah was bullied are sort of diminutive...but devastating none the less.  Many times thoughout the book, it seems like Hannah was the type of person that wouldn't care at all what these other kids were saying about her. She also seemed to have the frame of mind and quick tongue to throw their garbage right back in their faces.  So why didn't she? Emotional bullying is by far more damaging than physical bullying but Hannah was no angel and provided several \\"excuses\\" for her questionable behavior. The book does discuss her attempt at getting help only to be told to \\"get over it\\".  That is sad and unacceptable and I fear it is all too common.  All in all, a decent read and eye-opening to parents of teenagers.  Drives home the fact that it is very unwise to toy with people's emotions.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|This is a fabulous and very real portrait of alcoholism.  Had me loving and hating Denzel within the two hours!
0140449337|5.0|It was awesome.  It came with comprehensive notes, and the quality of the read was appreciated.  Its split up so one chapter or &#34;Book&#34; doesn't run on to long, dilating the meaning.
B004QCJA7W|5.0|I gave this book to our 11 year old granddaughter and when I opened the package from Amazon, I couldn't believe the excitement I felt at seeing a book I had so treasured.  I couldn't find my own Grosset and Dunlap book to give her. This arrived in such beautiful condition, wrapped in tightly sealed plastic (I know that's not very green) it looked like it could be a rare edition.
B0045HCIZY|5.0|Well done depiction of falling in love in a realistic way.  Nicely filmed and perfect casting.  Definitely a good flick.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I am retired special ops, air force. This book  brought every facet of life we all have gone through as military warriors and as a true patriot of anything I have read to date. Extraordinary!  I have the utmost respect for all of my military brothers and sisters,  God be with you!
B001HM1PFO|5.0|I hadn't seen this movie since I was a kid and had forgotten everything that happens in it. When I re-watched it I LOVED it. Not a disappointing movie
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Read this to know what words mean. This is a dictionary after all. But there are other ways to get meanings
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Love Jeffrey Archer, LOVE this series!  Wonderful story, history, drama, suspense, and twists! Hate to wait another year for next book in The Clifton Chronicles.
1452110581|5.0|Gave this book to my sister as a birthday gift - she has many cats - we both enjoyed reading it.<br />E. Pentecost
B00B4804KS|4.0|the movie looks like it was originaly shot in 3d. its still jurrasic park just more in your face. picture quality looks great.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I was in there! However I had to have the reminders of the era, It felt like it was happening well before it's time.<br />I think this book has the potential for being a great back drop for a very good TV serial.<br />The characters were so real and so wanting to be seen as well as heard. I see this serial having some of those other very real characters like Daphne and Rose the doctor & Gladys having their own mini adventures on the side as well as the main people in the book. I just love the part where poor Jamie had his moment with his zipper as well as his new toupee. Well done to the author to paint such a vivid portrait of each character.I was turning the pages as if I was in the middle of a gripping murder mystery. Great story. Well told. Should be a TV serial.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I enjoyed the story.  Finished reading it in only a few days.  Would recommend it to others<br />Characters are well developed
0756655307|5.0|This was a gift for my beau's 8 year old son.  He was obviously happy with it, and my beau stated that &#34;It's one serious book.&#34;  So, he was happy with it too, even if it was intended for his son.. haha!  The best part is, it arrived the day before my beau's son's birthday, which made it even better.
B00CRS88IO|4.0|As a reader who likes spies and history, The Ian Fleming Files gave me great pleasure. It is a genre novel, so it does have a bit of predictability (at least for me) but it has enough surprises that will keep you on the edge of your cozy seat. Short enough to devour in one night., as I did, and leaves you wanting more. If you are a fan of the James Bond books, check this series out.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I thought the movie was extremely great, but a little too long for my liking. Well told story and I loved how the ending.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|An easy read.  Very fluid.  It kept my interest as I read.  I would read other books from this author.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I wish it would keep a tally of my high scores like it does on my cell phone. Only thing with my cell, the phone wouldn't ring during a game. Sent my calls straight to v.m. so glad to play on the kendle.
B005YZX32I|2.0|Why would they not allow the PC version to zoom? Pretty stupid really. iPad will, however, so that's good.  Probably won't buy for that reason alone.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|what can I say, it is the same as I have on my computer. Nothing earthshaking but works as expected so I am glad I didn't have to figure it out.
B00915G6YE|5.0|This Season was a bit different but different IS what's needed at this point..  Loved the season.. Shocking ending, and now the speak of a Final eighth season!?  ...hope not, there is so much more that needs to happen..  Do not hesitate!  Great for all DEXTER fans!
B00122OCQI|5.0|I love this album and older Depeche Mode in general. Everyone should have this and Violator in their collection. Ok
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Very excited to hear this new cd!  Took some getting used too at first but my true love and dedication for this band stayed!!  I watched the Letterman Show and the two video's!  Such a great cd!!  The bonus tracks are extremely good!!  I love this as much as Universe!  Saw DM last tour in Virginia and now i have my ticket to see them again this tour!!  HELL YEAH!!<br /><br />Favorite tracks at the moment are..Broken..Alone and Happens all the time.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Really enjoy this album. The song Touch is my favorite, but the album as a whole is great.  Yup it's great. Must get to 20 words here.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Honestly one of the best films of the year. A great story and QT nails history with his own twist.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I really like the Facebook app with my fire gen 2! The layout and look is great.  It has nice features like flipping thru photos while on the homepage.
B003B02OOG|5.0|Great stories.  Hard to put down.  A bit different than typical grisham plots but quite entertaining.  I would recommend for quick read.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Ready to use and very thorough, with maps, videos and full reports.  Does it all. And it covers any city anywhere.  Highly recommended.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Very well acted and excellent action scenes.  Tom Cruise is not one of my favorite actors but portrays Jack Reacher well.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This book was just ok.  The ending was predictable and the writing wasn't very good.  Disappointing.  I'm hoping the movie will be better.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I found this most interesting. It goes to prove that all the horror stories one hears about North Korea are true. Mr. Harden did a wonderful job of putting me in his book as I read.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|The Videos are free to watch in terms of money, but you do have to spend a little time watching a commercial every now and again.  I didn't count but it seemed like one commercial every four or five videos.  The search function will find videos in the library by artist and by  bits of the lyrics.<br /><br />I was surprised by the number of groups who turned up when I was doing lyrics searches whom I had never heard of before.  I'll probably get around to watching some of those groups--eventually.  Right now I'm looking up lots of favorites from the Eighties, Nineties and Oughts and watching them again.<br /><br />In Short--This is a great app for finding and watching music videos.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Rented the movie through Amazon and plated it thru the WII.  We saw the movie advertised in the theatres but missed it and this was the next best way to see it.  We are happy with the purchase.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|I was at one of their performances last summer and these discs brought back many momories.  The Beach Boys are one of the greatest of all time.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|All the twists and turns keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Very hard to put the book down.  Can't wait to read the next book.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved this book. It was perfection. Funny, witty, and steamy. I laughed out loud too many times to count. I have never read a male POV that was more spot on. Emma Chase is now on my must buy list. Everything I love in a book was here, and that is SO rare. I highly recommend this book.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is a great book. Many twists and turns, you never know what is going to happen next! Annabeth and Percy go through lots of things as a couple. That includes Hazel and Frank dealing with Leo, and Piper and Jason with their relationship.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Great app for fractions, no more converting to decimal and back to fraction to solve. It uas a very smooth user interface and uses little memory.
B0013J1WKY|5.0|Big fan and love this concert. Can't wait to get all of her concerts and share them with friends & family.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is a great app for making quick notes and having them sync to acess across many devices.  I use it for work constantly and for grocery lists.
B00AN0KGWE|3.0|Too often slips to lower streaming quality.  My broadband is fast so should not have been an issue at my end.  Slightly spoils the enjoyment of immediate viewing.  Otherwise the cloud concept is fantastic!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|You know it's going to be a great book because it is a Nicholas sparks book but this book has the best ending I have read in a long time. I read so many books that it's hard to find one that surprises me but this book did. I loved it.
1563523302|5.0|Change my view of money. This book was my introduction to personal finance. This book changed my perspective on money. Highly recommend.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This product protects my Kindle really well. My little girl has yet to bang it up and well you know how kids can be.
B005HSL626|5.0|ok this game is so AWESOME its a good game to play if your really bored....I love it so get this app
B003O86FMW|3.0|Great momentum in the beginning and plateaus halfway through. Not very thrilling due to its predictability. Although it wasn't great, it is still mildly entertaining.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book was so much fun to read it has humor and Greek and Roman mythology!!!!!The saddest part was about features!!!!! Read this book
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I must admit I had some hesitation with picking this book up, but it is insightful and is very telling of how far we need to go in order to change diversity (male/vs female dynamic) in the workforce.
B009NG1Q96|3.0|I really enjoyed the first book in this series, Selection. This book picks up just a couple of weeks after the first ends. It holds promise at the beginning, however I did not find that this book was worth the price point at almost $15. Nothing actually happened in this book and it probably could have been combined into the first or the next book and most of the content could have been skipped altogether. It's mainly just America going back on forth on whether she wants Aspen or Maxon and it goes in circles. That being said. I am looking forward to the next book, as long as it has her final decision and we find out who America ends up with!
0525953728|4.0|The story was interesting; different from any book I had read before.  I would recommend it if someone asked about it.
B005LAIII0|4.0|A beautiful story with real spiritual significance. Gorgeous cinematography and nature enhancing special effects. I will watch again soon. word
1451668945|5.0|As always, Mary Higgins Clark does a superb job; this book was somewhat different from her other books, in a good way.  It was very enjoyable and I had a hard time putting it down.
B004I9CXHW|4.0|I've been using it for a few months now.  Works great with my usb stick for music and my phone for charging.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|my son loves to play this and so do I! Graphics are nice and is interactive.  Finding Memo characters throughout.
B008OIQYTG|5.0|As a whole, I had absolutely no problems with this transaction. Was very happy with the condition of my new/used merchandise and prompt service. Looking forward to doing more business with this seller in the near future.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|this is the second device that ive tried to play this on and the second device that it wont work on at all. fails a download at the beginning and then there are no updates for it.
B001TH16DS|5.0|As a whole, I had absolutely no problems with this transaction. Was very happy with the condition of my new/used merchandise and prompt service. Looking forward to doing more business with this seller in the near future
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|enjoyable and light hearted movie.  Easy to follow. Kept my interest.  Acting was very good. Good story Line. Well written
B00AAX68HG|4.0|this is a great game to waste time on.  I like the fact that there are many different ways to solve the puzzles. plus, I like to go back and get the crown from every level.
B0062IQNG4|4.0|I've been a fan since the books first came out so obviously I enjoy just about every track. Recomend highly for anyone into the movie.
B006WB7IN8|5.0|This was a fantastic book - I would highly recommend it! I was sorry when I finished it, because I really could not put it down.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|Save your money. Unless you really like Religious TV, that was the only channels that I could get. Does not work.
B0055S348W|5.0|Amazing! I've been able to print from Google docs on EVERY wireless printer I've come across so far! Setup is fairly easy and the speed is acceptable. If I find a printer that it doesn't work for I'll edit the review with tips on what to do.<br />I'm using a nexus S with Sprint.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini has done it again!  His characters reach out to the reader with their feelings, virtues and shortcomings.  Let us hope that his muse does not fade like it did for a storyteller in this beautiful book.
0670014893|4.0|Surely not his best, not \\"The Spy\\" or \\"Smiley's,\\" but the man still has it.  Far better than that Panama thingee or even the blood diamonds episode which they also made into a flicker.<br /><br />At 70, he's still convincing, enveloping, just simply wonders wouldn't it be?
B00BB22GQM|5.0|&#34;Every song on this album is excellent. It is well written and extremely catchy. By far their best album so far.&#34;
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A little difficult to follow because of the several and the variety of scenarios taking place. Unusual plot. Acceptable grammar.
B004RJMUJO|2.0|Downloaded this game to see what all the hype was about. Slicing fruit? That's it? Sure it's colorful but one round on zen mode was  plenty for me. And on game mode the blade is less than responsive on the kindle fire hd.  I sliced through the fruit but the blade was never there for me. Between these two things and the eventual boredom with this game I'd give it a one star, but gave it two for its colorful gameplay and ability to get new weapons and backgrounds.
B006VA3ZT6|5.0|I can't believe three whole seasons have gone by before I heard about this wonderful PBS production.  It is full of intricate and captivating story lines and characters that have me glued to the tv far much longer than I'm accustomed to.  I highly recommend this program and look forward to many more seasons in the future.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I paid a lot more for another kindle fire hd case that turns on and off when you open and shut it.  This one is just as good<br />as the other one for less money.
068485743X|5.0|This book has everything you need to know about avoiding the much hated rejection pile or as I like call it the pile where some wannabe author at the firm goes through and picks through the manuscript and takes what they want.
B009NY43NY|2.0|True to the last several Sookie books, DEA has plot twists that you can see well ahead of time and a little deus ex machina to resolve the story arc. There were a few genuine surprises, but none that forced me to turn the next page to figure out the resolution.  There were inconsistencies (Barry could not broadcast to Sookie from a few yards away, yet in book 2 Sookie was able to reach him from across Dallas). Exactly the ending I expected from a series that had a tenuous claim to mediocrity for the last half dozen books.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Much improved love that we can make it our own. I think if u liked before you'll love it now.  The only thing I don't like so far is they don't list the upgrade price on the buildings.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|A timeless classic . There is no way you and your family won't love watching this Disney classic over & over again.
B00AVF8USS|5.0|Wow Wow! . Best movie I have ever seen hands down no joke! I now see what all hype was. Glad I bought it, now I can watch again and again.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|Graphics cs and gameplay are great but the freemium model kills it.  I shouldn't have to pay for pots and training upgrades.  Freemium games are a money leech.  I would rather put the game flat out.
B005H29GSI|5.0|My nephews loved this game. Not only did it combine their love of angry birds and destruction but it also allowed them the get creative and build their hand eye coordination skills.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really like the stratification aspects of this game. It makes you think in different ways to make it all work out.
B00007L4OM|4.0|This is a fun, silly, and colourful movie.  The film doesn't take itself too seriously so it doesn't cross into chessiness.<br />Good clash between the Tough Cop and bubbly Japanese girl.<br /><br />I would like this if I liked Fifth Element.<br />This is fun in the same way as Rush Hour is fun, but is less cheesy, so I like Wasabi better.
B008BU75IQ|2.0|I preordered this book because the first two in the series were very good.  But,this was a huge disappointment.  No time was spent on previous characters.  The story took a strange turn when focusing on Sebastian.  No closure on Jessica or Giles. Seems like there was a rush to complete the book.  And, why a cliff hanger in the supposed last book of a trilogy?
B000VD5I94|5.0|An interesting about this movie is this is one of the few movies I have watched that don't portray Asians in any special way.  They are not stereotypes (nerd, socially awkward, Chinese hackers, kung fu masters, ninjas, etc.).  They may be bad guys because... there's no reason.  They may be good guys for also no reason: just because.  They are just people.  Everyone are just people.  (Score 1 for equality).<br /><br />When I watched this in 2008 I got a kick about how it described Detroit and the general economy at that time.<br /><br />There are great lines from the different characters all around.  Robocop is cool.<br />Thoroughly enjoyable movie.<br /><br />&#34;Nice shooting son.  What's your name?&#34;<br />&#34;Murphy.&#34;<br /><br />FIN.
B00BGGIW2K|5.0|Don't buy CDs! Every song is good and it comes with the digital download. Best of both worlds. Also, Mike Milosh sounds like the male Sade.
B007SOQBCM|3.0|Used to be better when you could search for streams. As a TwitchTv streamer and not one of the well known steamers, but still a steamer, my friends can no longer search for my stream on the app to watch whatever games I may be playing. Other than that I love the app.
0670026557|5.0|I just finished reading the book. I found the reasoning/logical connection was very compelling. I was not fully convinced by some of the stories. The reason for which I am still giving a lot of credit to the book is that I truly believe the book motivates people to be better. This is an incredible achievement.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|keeps you playing but have to wait 30 minutes for a new life after the 5 lives are gone. its cool
B0026KX5PO|1.0|Poke your eyes out.  You'll get more entertainment that way.  Terrible plotline and downhill from there.  At least it was free.
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|Nice to hear Willie singing the old standards, he has such immense talent.  So happy to add this to my collection!
B007BVMVDU|5.0|This show is great for anyone who enjoys fantasy or Lord of the Rings-type stuff. It's also pretty heavy on drama and relationships. I would say an accurate description would be Lord of the Rings meets the Sopranos. I feel like the show can be a bit too heavy on the sex/nudity. Sometimes there are scenes where they are explaining major parts of the story during sexual encounters and it just feels a bit weird. Still, the show is very well done and each episode feels like a miniature movie.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|This movie is almost 3 hours. It's very interesting to watch the 4 storylines play out and the costuming and acting are really good. The plot of the entire movie is pretty vague, I thought it would make more sense, but it seemed more like a movie where they expect you to draw your own conclusions, so a little strange. I kind of expect a movie to tie things up and explain at least somewhat. Especially when it's 3 hours long!
B002GKXS2O|3.0|I have all seasons 1-6, however, when I got the last season I was trying to savor it. Season 6 is still in it's packed plastic. And since I wanted to watch it in a \\"flow\\" fashion I started back from the beginning. And I started watching the lovely seasons on here :D<br /><br />Now for the bad news. Season 6 was so confusing and all over the place. I agree with other reviewers it was definitely rushed and no one was really in character. Including Shane..WTH happened to Shane LOL<br /><br />Let me start from the beginning. Once I reached the climax of season 5, I kept procrastinating to watch season 6. Finally I watched the first episode which started with chaos of ambulance and the group of girls in Bette and Tina's house. So my first question when I saw it was \\"Did Jenny kill herself?\\" of course I would have NEVER thought to ask \\"Who killed Jenny?\\". Let me start with<br /><br />Bette and Tina: I'm very excited that the show ended with them having a strong relationship in the end. I knew they were going to get back together, but I was doubtful at the same time because I didn't think that Bette could be faithful. Bette definitely has a problem, but I'm happy Tina stands her ground and placed a nice line for Bette not to cross. I just think that, that girl trying to seduce Bette was completely left field. I did like how they ended the show with them starting over together in a new state. That was the best ending for them.<br /><br />Alice and Tasha: I love them together, I feel they make a wonderful couple and they have strong views and convictions, however, the whole three-some friendship situation was just plain stupid and weird. I would have been so upset if Tasha got with that girl. But nope, in the end Alice and Tasha stayed together YAY!<br /><br />Max: OK, when I first began watching this show and they first introduced FTM on the show, I knew nothing of them. After dating a FTM I have come to realize that they did a complete horrible interpretation of what a FTMis. First of all, when a woman starts taking testosterone EVERYTHING changes. Body mass, facial hair and something they truly didn't think about that made this whole thing unrealistic THE VOICE. When a woman takes testosterone their voice gets deeper. They should have done their research. As my girlfriend says, It would've been great to bring an actress already in the process of taking testosterone and as the show and her process went along you could have gotten a realistic transformation. But Max's character is bizarre to me.<br /><br />Shane: What can I say about Shane except she should have stayed with Carmen, they made a beautiful/sexy couple. But she had a distorted mind thinking that she's just like her father, so she just follows in his footsteps. But with Carmen, they had a strong relationship and I really thought Shane would change. After Carmen though, I really just said she's a lost cause. She will never commit. And I just really don't understand her reasoning for being with Jenny. That relationship began bizarre and fast, it didn't have a build up at all nor did it make sense. Did they just wanted to push the envelope on a strong friendship turning into a relationship? And why with Jenny, you of all people because you know her should know how she is!!! Oh Shane.<br /><br />Jenny: I hated Jenny after she cheated on Tim. I hated her even more once she started getting her career off the ground. She reminded me of me and at first I could relate to her. However!!!! When she started to act weirder and weirder, crazier and crazier and not to mention a stuck up, snobby person I just said oh no. And forget it I wished she didn't exist in season 6. I just wanted people to bring her back to reality and to her senses and knock all that shadiness she was doing. I do agree with a reviewer on here, it would've been nice for everyone to confront her on her B.S.<br /><br />Helena: Her story line was good up until she left with the prison girl. After that she made no sense to me, she just kept on doing stupid things. Like getting back with the girl who sent her a subpoena for sexual harassment. What in the world?! I just really didn't like her character in season 6, it was just plain stupid.<br /><br />Kit: After Ivan I really fantasized about her being with a woman and actually get into a commitment with a woman. But that never happened because her body doesn't respond to her own kind as she says in season 6 LOL very disappointed. Now what I don't understand is the drag queen that she ends up with in the end. They really didn't open a story line for him. Just that Kit and him were \\"girlfriends\\". But every time they interacted I kept saying they were going to hook up. Then once the queen revealed the man underneath the make-up as a straight man who loves the gay community I was actually surprised and gave him a thumps up, but it didn't reveal why he was a drag queen. Aren't there other job positions available? But Kit started falling off the screen. She was in the background and to be honest I forgot she was even there. And I loved me some Kit in every season, but season 6 she really wasn't playing a role.<br /><br />All in all, I hated it. I hated the fact that it was the last season and that there was only 8 episodes. I kept saying to myself as new dilemma kept arising that there wasn't enough episodes to resolve any problems. Then I came to the conclusion that something happened to the production of this show and my guess is that there was way more seasons that covered all the dilemma that happened in this season but it would have revealed itself gradually and it would have made more sense. They had to end the show somehow so they probably put at least 3 more seasons into one, but it was just a disaster.<br /><br />To be honest I didn't like the show focusing on Jenny at all, who cares?! I say she killed herself. But apparently someone killed her and if I had to say who it was, my first suspicion was Bette, because they were talking on the unfinished stairs over the pool. If you ask me there was I think four suspects: Bette, Tina, Shane and Nikki. They all have motives. But I don't know. Season 6 was just so horrible!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Everyone I've run into loves the TV series, Downton Abbey.  Bought these DVD's as a gift for someone that hasn't seen it and I knew she'd like it.  I bought a used set and saved some money.
B003VW54QO|5.0|I have always loved this show, and I would recommend it to any western lover. It's got gunfights, A pretty Lady ,some good music, and did I say a good gunfight. Oh, I just about left out the one main thing John Wayne, The Duck....  is in it.<br /><br />TSpro713
B00APKIN1I|5.0|Awesome disk. Lots of hits on this CD. Paul M. is fantastic. Every song is great. I highly recommend this one.
B009329Y30|5.0|Definitely one of my favorite movies. Totally worth the money spent. Would recommend it to all the women out there.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|I've followed this series from the beginning.  Wonderful story, and I was sorry to hear this was the last season
B003WJQ74E|5.0|I read this book back in high school and I just read again and after 45 years it is still an awesome story.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This is the second mouse I bought as gift, the first one for my son and he loved it. So I bought another one for my nephew's birthday, he loved it too.
B0054NRC6S|5.0|EVERYONE SHOULD WATCH THIS MOVIE and the featurette to understand WHY the writer and producer DID this movie- to get closer to reality and be better able to PREPARE themselves AND THEIR KIDS for the new way and the myth of &#34;job security&#34; in this country.  Things have changed and well meaning &#34;parents&#34; should see that NO amount of right education will prevent &#34;the new way&#34; from changing back to the old ways.<br /><br />Those who learn to &#34;think out of the box&#34; will be best prepared for the future- which is already here to stay!
B004HWYTP4|4.0|This movie was a fun and enjoyable experience. It wasn't too heavy and kept me entertained throughout. The character played by John Malcovich was especially fun to watch.
1401322786|5.0|As usual, the plot is well structured, the characters are clear and all dramatic elements are presented in the right place, right time.  The philosophy behind the book is simple yet not easy to comprehend.  Makes a perfect gift for booklovers and philosophers who like to drill inot the meaning of some metaphysical!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was compelling as it was both emotional and relatable. It was a beautiful piece, I wish there was a sequel!
B008BU75IQ|2.0|I'm sorry not to give a good review...but after LOVING the first 2 books in this series, I was so disappointed in this book.  I thought it was boring and I really hated the ending.
B00C061HZY|5.0|I'm a relatively new fan of Daft Punk; I discovered them from the Tron: Legacy soundtrack which I bought immediately after seeing the movie, which in turn led me to discover their Discovery album (which I bought on vinyl).  So I am not as entrenched into the EDM, dance club style of Daft Punk as hardcore Daft Punk fans are.  I appreciate their past music for their sound, ability to mix samples to make new forms of music out of old songs, the bass beats and vocoder vocals.  Random Access Memories is a whole different animal from their past discography, which has been controversial among fans to say the least.  I really love all the sounds, melodies, and large list of contributors that went into making this album.  There's a wide range of music, from the slow and mellow The Game of Love, to the hard-hitting electronic Contact at the end of the album.<br /><br />Despite this album having many different contributors scattered throughout the songs, it is definitely not just a compilation of disparate songs slapped into one package; I would call this a concept album where each song follows the previous song in a linear journey.  And while you can listen to an individual song on its own, it really is more enjoyable to listen to the album from beginning to end (like other concept albums such as Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, and The Wall).<br /><br />I won't comment on individual songs.  I'll talk a little bit about the more important aspect to me, which is the sound and feel of the album.  First off, I love the funky guitar riffs scattered throughout the album (particularly on Give Life Back to Music, Lose Yourself to Dance, and Get Lucky), many of which were done by the legendary Niles Rodgers.  The vocoder vocals are poignant and fit in so well. I think Daft Punk learned to appreciate string orchestras from their experience making the Tron soundtrack, because they use them on a few songs.  They also throw in keyboards, pianos, slide/steel guitars, and flutes, all of which were played flawlessly. The drum tracks throughout the songs are spectacular.  Playing the vinyl on my living room system, the drum work is so rich that it gives the feeling of listening to a live band. And that ties into the next thing I was impressed with: the production quality.<br /><br />The production quality is nothing short of amazing on this album.  From what I understand, the songs were recorded in analog, which should result in them sounding great on vinyl.  And they do!  What this album does is takes you back to 70's and 80's funky disco melodies, but with an extremely clean and rich sound that was not possible with production technology of prior decades.  While playing an old disco record on the record player is great for nostalgic purposes, you can throw Random Access Memories on the turntable and satisfy the nostalgia while sounding ABSOLUTELY AMAZING at the same time.  I'm sure this album will be a favorite of many people to demo their sound systems.  Want to demonstrate your subwoofer?  Play just about any of these songs, they all have a wide range of bass effects, especially Doin' It Right.<br /><br />Excellent work, Robots.  This one will be staying in my playlist for a long time.
B004HD61KE|5.0|During this time when the American government appears untrustworthy this novel makes one think such behavior is not new. I enjoy reading about the \\"secret\\" historical truths in this novel. Mr Rollins has a great talent weaving historical fact into his fictional story. I give it 5 stars.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I loved reading this book and trying to decide which of the characters was more sympathetic.  But I was disappointed at the end of the book.  The story made wide jumps in time, unlike the beginning, and then seemed to peter out without a satisfactory resolution.  Sometimes that technique works.  A book that leaves the reader hungry to know more can be good if the author intends to continue with another novel.  In this case, it simply left me dissatisfied and heartily sick of both characters.  I wouldn't read another.
1416563156|5.0|This book was an awesome replica for the price. My five-year-old son enjoyed looking at the pictures. Only thing when you get the book it's too perfect so you might want to bend it to make it look used book was in new condition so I had to rough it up a little bit
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Got this app for my son, to help with fractions, and it is very user friendly.  Make math so much easier for him.  He is dyslexic and autistic, so finding something to easy the frustration of homework is great!!

B0028MBKVG|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with this book, but once I started, I couldn't put it down!  The little bits of running science and evolutionary biology peppered throughout a great story with characters that feel like old friends made for an interesting and fun read.  Definitely made me want to get out and run!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Really love the game.. Very addicted. Some rooms are hard to get items but you can trade from people from your FB acct or had new friends to the list. The daily spin is fun. The tournament is great!!! Plays great on kindle fire... get it!!!!!

B004Z7AHZC|4.0|This is a very cute series and I would highly recommend it to anyone as it is very family friendly!
159668139X|4.0|Appears to be a well-written guide to getting started with a 4-shaft loom.  Although I'm sure many of the techniques will applicable to my starter 2-shaft table loom, I don't recall seeing anything in the product description about it being designed for the larger, more complex loom.  I hope to work up to this some day and have not seen (what appears to be) as good a manual for the simpler loom.

B007TKT2SK|5.0|I always have problem in checking my son's homework since I don't know how to do fractions.  I used to hate doing it.  No more headaches.  I have to make sure he is not stealing my phone to make sure he is not using it for his homework.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun,easy enough with a bit of a challenge.I would defiantly recoomend this to friends and family. Age I would say its 4-adult.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Great book!  Sad in many parts, but was still hard to put down.Written well, highly recommend it! Makes me want to look up flower definitions now.
B00993FEUK|5.0|This movie is absolutely beautiful inside and out. The &#34;bullying&#34; issue is one of great importance, that often gets swept under the rug. It is so refreshing to have a children's film creatively address both bullying issues (and with a subtle commentary on homosexuality as well) and encourage such positive values in young children. This film brings me to tears every time.<br /><br />The quality of the blu-ray is wonderful. The picture is sharp and colorful.
B005ILYW1E|2.0|I love Jason Statham usually but this movie leave much to be desired.  In my opinion the language was more than foul with F___ everywhere and you can barely understand what they are saying because of the heavy accents.  There was action but most of it was just grueling senseless killing to me, which I believe did not show Jason's true talents.<br />I was very disappointed and I won't be adding this one to my collection.  Too bad cause I was excited to see it, let's hope that Parker is better.<br /><br />Well on to the next movie.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Don't know how I got by without this app.  I really do love it.  I have used it for so many things.  It works just exactly like I need it to.  It works for me without any problems at all.  The light is perfect.  So happy I found it.  If you need a good flashlight app for your Kindle, this is the one.
B004GXZ69W|2.0|I am in the military and it did not work with a KVM switch, which allows me to use one monitor and one mouse for all three networks that we run. Without this functionality, I would have to unplug it and plug it in every time I switch network. Other than that, for nomral use it probably works fine.
B003VANOFY|4.0|The sound on the headset is great, and the microphone is very clear.  Can't complain about the ability to take a piss while talking to friends either, but there are times when the head &#34;resets&#34; and has to reconnect to the wireless device.  This happens at very short range as well (the wireless adapter is only 2 ft away).
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|I had read the book years ago and the movie from my recollection does a good job of recreating the book.  I am sure its not as detailed but, I really enjoyed the movie.  The effects were great.  3d was good but, more so in increasing the depth as opposed to in your face effects.  Although there were some good in your face shots also.  Would definitely recommend but as one other viewer noted may not be for young eyes.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Love the creative way this classic has been made into a relevant modern story.  Fun to watch.  Only wish there were more episodes.
B007SGM084|5.0|This was a trilogy that was enjoyable, educational to a point, mysterious. I liked the fact that one book led directly into the next. Would recommend this set to any mature adult.

B009GED3HS|5.0|Although I didn't like the episode itself.The Quality of the show on amazon was really good.<br />Nothing to complain about.
0525953728|5.0|Could hardly put it down. An easy read that highlights the life of a Navy seal without a lot of details of the internal US political battles or jargon that some military books feature. Would highly recommend.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|His images were so real, you felt as if you had gone to heaven with him.<br />I compare it to the book:&#34;The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven&#34;.<br />I recommend it to all Christians and those who have questions of life after death.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Having grown up with end game stories from the greats such as Asimov, Orwell, and P K Dick, this is a horrifying retro story about the ends people will go to to control the fates of others.<br />I reminded of childhood favorites like The Wall, On The Beach, and Brave New World. Yep, I'm OLD.<br />But this story adds new twists and possibilities to the genra of doomsday science fiction: young protagonists, a multi layered plot, and fascinating future possibilities.<br /><br />YOU GO HUGH! I'll be reading more of you
B008K6HN8I|1.0|I was attempting a workaround, using Flash on my HD Kindle. ES was not helpful and was not structured to be intuitive.
B008I34YYY|4.0|The plot seems to jump about and I am left not believing the motivation of the characters. Of course, the whole thing is preposterous to begin with so why lose sleep over character motivations. It ends up being great fun to watch. The retro technology that the nazi employ is particularly interesting.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|When I first got this app I really loved it, little did I realize that when they &#34;suggest&#34;that you link to your Facebook account in case you lose your park, it wasn't a suggestion.  You will lose your park and all the time and money you've put into it.  I was at level 19 when my park was &#34;lost&#34;, and since I don't have, or want a Facebook page, I am just out of luck.  The irony is I'm considering opening an account just to tell people what a scam this is.

B007VUCAVO|5.0|I wasn't sure if this app was really worth it, but once I got it and calibrated it, I realized why there were so many positive reviews.  I like the fact that I can see exactly how much time I have depending on what I'm doing.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|this was a wonderful book and through the sadness and joy I was totally into the story. I laughed a lot at the words of the country folk. I cried at the orphanage chapters. I smiled at the ending. I am so glad to have read it.
B0038P59A0|5.0|I purchased the second Sherlock Holmes film starring Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law; I liked it so much I had to buy the first film.<br />Robert and Jude give excellent performances in their roles. The director, screen writers, etc. give the characters much more characterization than the old films. The new renditions are much more interesting, exciting and full of action and some humor too.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My 6-year-old says \\"it's 5 stars because I like it a lot\\". It's challenging and keeps him busy for a long time. He has gotten past the 17th level! The graphics are great.

B00CW665VI|5.0|Tangled was such a great book!!!  I was sucked right in!  I loved how the story is told by Drew, he is funny as hell, honest, and such an ass....typical male!!  It was great being in his head, and learning all his male advice!!  The way that he and Kate are together is so well written.  I would totally recommend this book!!
B000N4SHPS|5.0|A great movie I have watched it at least ten times and will keep on watching it a lot more...
0061950726|5.0|To think of a child being paraded and displayed like a side of beef in front of adults is a hard pill to swallow, yet between 1854 and 1929 that is exactly what happened to many city orphans. Children of varying ages were put on board an Orphan train and sent out west to poor rural families, who often needed a work hand on the farm or just couldn't have a child of their own. These children were put on display for the town folk and then handed over to complete strangers. Some children had good lives, but others weren't so lucky and ended up as runaways.<br />ORPHAN TRAIN by author Christina Baker Kline tells the harrowing story of Vivian Daly, who rode the Orphan Train to an uncertain future in Minnesota, 1929.  With little regard to her feelings, Vivian's new family changes her name from Niamh to Dorothy as simply as if she were a new pet. Vivian is forced to work like a seamstress and loses any sense of any true childhood or family life. Alone, she must face the obstacles that come her way, including rivalry in the workplace. Then jump to 2011. Trouble teen Molly Ayer is a foster child, who has been through the pain of losing her family and getting lost in the system. Now in trouble with the law, Molly has to work community hours cleaning out an attic for an elderly woman, who has storages of hidden treasures tainted with a painful past. Now as the two women connect, they find that age doesn't really matter as they discover they have something in common.<br />ORPHAN TRAIN is a fictional novel based on historical fact. This emotionally charged novel is both thought provoking and very moving. Christina Baker Kline has a knack for placing a reader right in the mix of things and stirring up an emotional response.  A highly recommended read.
B004PR73HM|5.0|I never new about this artist until I downloaded Domino which is a good song.  You will love this cd every song is a good song.
B00631HASU|5.0|This was one of my favorite PC games, so I did not hesitate to purchase the Kindle version.  The two versions are very much alike.  The Kindle version has a \\"Circle of Fire\\" (or something like that) power-up that fires a 360-degree circle of bullets, while the PC version has the \\"Eagle-Eye\\" that indicates the firing direction.  All the other power-ups and amulets are the same.  The Kindle version is noticeably easier than the PC version, but I still can't win the Expert (highest) level on either platform.  I am addicted!
B008OOYALE|3.0|I like this game. But its a shame the processing takes forever &amp; you get kicked off unexpectedly when visiting nbr's! You really have to have patience for this game!! Fun; but exhausting when rebooting constantly! I've lost nbr's cause the game won't let me visit or play without getting kicked off! Ugh!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Great colors and easy to view. Plug in a town around the world and check out the weather. What's not to love. The only thing missing is the percentage of chances of rain, otherwise no complaints.
1455502758|4.0|The book was short, and didn't talk as much about his views on death and dying as I would expect him to.  It was more just an account of his last months of life, and it seemed to be written in a scattered manner; it didn't completely flow.  Still a good read, just not $14 good.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is a great clock and very easy to use. I like that I can easily mark the days I want to have a repeated alarm set
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Can't wait for the next book. Anybody who has not discovered Jeffery Archer will become a fan if they read this series.  His best yet.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Definitely not what I was expecting and definitely not my style at all but i guess others might enjoy it
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|I don't like this film at all. I hate to think that this is such a hit with kids. Are we so cold and distant from this concept that we don't see the murder going on in this movie? These are children killing children. YIKES! I'm sorry, but I don't get the enjoyment of this movie at all!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Small and compact and gets the job done.Easy to use.Not sure what else to say.Good product and again easy to use. Whew finally 20 words.LOL

0316044695|5.0|An amazing book made even better because it's a true story!  Words can't describe how incredible this story is and I hope the movie that is soon coming does it justice! Read this book!
B005LAIIHG|4.0|I enjjoyed this film because it was a bit different .The only thing I didnt like was seeing all the animals drowning and then being killed by the tiger . Im an animal lover and any sort of animal suffering really upsets me. I know it wasnt real and that it was just hollywood but it still upsets me.Putting all that aside as It was only a very small part of the movie I found the movie unusual in its story line.I was disappointed at the end when the tiger didnt look back. I wanted to think that a kind of bond had developed between human and wild animal.I was thinking that was the way the story was developing. I was surprised by this movie as it didnt develop as I thought it would.
B0090SI42Y|5.0|Super awesome kung-fu flick! Takes some of the old, traditional aspects of kung-fu movies with the fresh violence, gore and music of today! Good acting and good story with plenty of great action! Plus, I wouldn't mind spending a night in that brothel...
B007REV4T8|5.0|What can I say except great movie. Lots of action and stuff happening as usual .Very sad to see Judie Dench die at the end.

B0094BB4TW|2.0|To the managers of the Facebook app for Kindle Fire, the version currently in progress for the Kindle Fire is one of the older versions. Not to mention it's also slow. I would personally (and most other people) would like to have the latest update if possible.
B007JRU2UK|5.0|Great Movie For Adults.  Funny, yet sad at times, many average people can relate to the challenges the protagonist faces in this extraordinary situation.
030758836X|3.0|There are over 10,000 reviews of this book so at this point there is not much to add. When I was debating over reading this book I noted that a lot of reviewers were not pleased with the ending.  With that I totally agree.  It's a good read for a long flight or when you want to pass some time.  There are parts that are a little implausible but its a good read - except for the ending.<br /><br />However, for those who have not read it, its best read knowing very little about the story.  That lack of knowledge going in clearly adds to the suspense.
B00C061I3K|5.0|First thing's first: If you, the reader, are expecting Random Access Memories to be EDM, then you're going to be in for one hell of a shock. RAM is one gigantic tribute to Dance music from the past, and, as such,is RADICALLY different from any of their previous works. Live Instruments,Choirs and Orchestral accompaniments are just some of the big changes in this album. Don't get me wrong, it has an electronic feel to it, mainly in their use of their signature vocoders and synthesizers, but now it has a more laidback and soulful touch to it akin to that of Disco and Funk music you'd hear during the  late 60s and all throughout the 70s. For the dynamic french duo, this is a massive experiment; one that, in my honest opinion, succeeded entirely.<br /><br />Track by Track Review:<br /><br />Give Life Back To Music: The track starts off with an intense, rock ballad vibe, and then immediately switches down into a chilled, disco tune that stays funky throughout the rest of the song. GLBTM carries a great groove (With no small thanks to Nile Rodgers), and acts as a great intro to the rest of the album.<br /><br />Game of Love: Undoubtedly RAM's equivalent to Something About Us from Discovery. Slow and Mournful, yet carries an undertone of groove beneath it, much like Something About Us did.  Truly a beautiful track to play on a rainy day.<br /><br />Giorgio by Moroder: This tune starts off as an interview of sorts, with Moroder talking about his past. However, once Moroder says,\\"My name is Giovanni Giorgio, but everybody calls me Giorgio\\", the tune immediately kicks off with a italo-disco groove reminiscent to The Chase from Midnight Express, culminating in an insane burst of energy at the end. GBM is undoubtedly one of the highlights of the album and one of my favorite DP songs to date.<br /><br />Within: After the insanity of GBM, Within provides a slow piano ballad with Chilly Gonzales keeping the track rather relaxed.<br /><br />Instant Crush: Lovely Guitar and Drums+ Vocals from Julian Casablancas from The Strokes= Love at first listen.<br /><br />Lose Yourself to Dance: Sweet. Jesus. The crunchy Drum beats and Nile's guitar strums give a fantastic funky base that only gets better with Pharrell's falsetto, jackson-esque voice and the Daft Duo chanting \\"come on\\" \\"come on\\" \\"come on\\" in the background. Out of all the tunes in the album, this one feels the most like Classic Daft Punk, reminding me a bit of HBFS from Discovery.<br /><br />Touch: One word: Insanity. This track changes SO much, it feels like a lucid dream that only gets better as it progresses. Definitely another Highlight of the album. Paul Williams proves, once again, that he is a musical genius.<br /><br />Get Lucky: A 6 minute version of the Radio Edit we've heard over and over again. However, unlike the edit,the full version carries a lot more substance with extended beats and better vocal transitions. Nile's Guitar strumming makes things all the better.<br /><br />Beyond: Super funky, smooth, and lyrically profound. One of my favorites from the album.<br /><br />Motherboard: Arguably the most \\"electronic\\" song in the album. Motherboard sounds like a tune from Tron Legacy with Bonobo-esque vibes underlying throughout.<br /><br />Fragments of Time: Ah yes, Todd's track. It's no Face to Face for sure, but it definitely provides a nice, warm feel, perfect for driving on the  road on a sunny day.<br /><br />Doin it Right: Another major highlight in the album, simply because of it's minimalistic attitude. The track is stripped bare, containing only a simple beat, some minor synth work, Dafty vocoders, and Panda's voice singing over it all. The simplicity of this track is what makes it so great, and definitely one of the tracks that many will consider their favorite off the album.<br /><br />Contact: This tune is an excellent closer ending in a 6 minute journey of never-ending builds. The track just builds in power right up unit the very end, where it drops off the edge of the musical abyss. A great way to close an album, IMO.<br /><br />So is RAM perfect? No. The album has flow/transition issues in some parts (Within's placement right after GBM, for example). Secondly, RAM is not exactly an album you'd hear in a Live concert, so its unlikely we'll hear most of the songs here in a future Alive tour, whenever that'll be. Aside from that, and some minor issues with a couple  of tracks, RAM is a diamond gem, and one of the few albums that will get better over time with each listen. After eight years of waiting, Random Access Memories turns out to be a fantastic masterpiece,and an album worth the long wait.

0470474874|3.0|I got this book because I wanted a workbook to work through. This book is more of a reference book. All the information is still of good quality. However, anyone with a decent amount of excel knowledge will find half of the book useless. Just not what I was looking for.
0307352153|5.0|This book explores the world of the introvert, starting from the history of how the extroverted ideal came into vogue. The author works through what is different between introverts and extroverts from a biological and cultural perspective. She also covers how the related area of sensitivity to stimuli can play a role in how introverts function.  What I particularly appreciated was the scientific studies supporting the data presented and acknowledgment of the differing needs of introverts and extroverts. One example that I found particularly gratifying was research into the open office concept and how this is absolutely the wrong way to go for tasks and people that need time to think and ponder. I saw this occur in real life as a former company went to this concept for a group of statisticians and clinical research personnel, and heard how unhappy and stressed most of the individuals became. I also got some affirmation on the struggles of class participation for introverts. While there were sections that did not apply to my situation, the information on how to communicate more effectively and how to deal with situations that are uncomfortable for introverts (public speaking) was very informative. For those who have children who are introverted, this book also has an extensive section on how to help them develop and achieve.<br />I am looking forward to going back and re-reading this book to see what else I might learn to help me manage my abilities and advocate for myself in a world that does not necessarily appreciate the introvert.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who likes love/ action books. This book is fantastic! I love every detail of it and they way Katniss and Peeta react towards the end of the book. Some parts are so sweet is just.. Full of love and dramatic scenes you can picture in your head. It's heartfelt at some parts. Read this attention grabbing book now!!!!
B003AYMZO2|5.0|Hands down the best show on TV. Great, original story that feels very real. It is not over the top and it has a good amount of humor in it. It makes you wonder what you would do if you were in the main character's (Walter White) shoes.
B002ZG98J6|5.0|It is a suspenseful movie that my kids have watched over and over and over!  The whole family enjoyed the movie!
B002JCSWV6|3.0|The problem is that I had seen it on an airplane and thought it would be great for the grandkids, but found the language to be unacceptable.  It would be nice if we could get more dvd s that were reedited for children.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|This cd is a great representation of last year's excellent C50 tour by the Beach Boys. While not containing every song performed on tour, the 41 song-set here does a great job of taking listeners back to those great shows of the reunion tour.  If you were not fortunate enough to attend then this is your chance to be there.
B0094M2S5A|5.0|Great Cast.  Great background music. Always enjoy remembering my youth and the times when life was less complicated -- so to speak.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|it's pretty self explanatory, but it is a bit difficult  with only having a few keys at your disposal, but i like that you can pick different songs. (i especially like the fullmetal alchemist theme song)

B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is the best bingo game on the Amazon market for the Kindle Fire 8.9&quot; bingo bash is a bad version of this game.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved this book full of action, suspense, & situations not so far from reality.  Excellent character development & deep insight into the cruelty & non existent concern for others that some societies or classes display for humanity in general. The dangers of selfish & unrestrained government control.  New idea of cruelty just as cruel as many actual circumstances throughout history.  Much to say on the human will to survive and loyalty of some to others among a world of oppression.<br /><br />In the 3 books we watch Katniss & other characters become different people just as real circumstances later all humans.  As much could be written about these books as the book itself contained about government oppression, the will to live, right and wrong, self serving people, double crossing power struggles & top ruthless realities that reach maturity via using others as pawns.<br /><br />Just mind blowing.  I have read the books over a few times.

B00065DWCW|5.0|Full reached, the album brings more songs to be a special English edition, is an excellent price in comparison to my country, stereo sound and great songs. It takes quite a bit so far but worth the wait.<br /><br />Llegó completo, el disco trae más canciones por ser una edición especial Inglesa, es un excelente precio en comparación a mi país, el sonido estereo y muy buenas canciones. Se tarda un poco por lo lejos pero vale la pena esperar.

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love the game.my cousin got this on his phone so I played it. After I saw the game on the app store I got it for free . And It works for kindle fire . So I beg you to get this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! =)
B00C061I3K|5.0|Yes, a good thing.  See, when a certain sound is everywhere (EDM) and is somewhat trendy, it's best to go in the opposite direction...when the artist in question, French Robot/Human duo EDM pioneers Daft Punk were making this new album, RAM, they did the next logical step anyone of merit would do...something different, while at the same time, pushing their sound forward...sometimes, going forward means going backward (in time, not backpedaling)...these 2 auteurs took inspiration from disco, funk, soul and 70s mellow rock via musical time travel, and placed it squarely in the year 2013.  There is not one current EDM sound a la Skrillex to be found here...yes DP pioneered the current EDM sounds back in 1997 or so, but the REAL pioneers include German rockers-turned-electronic band Kraftwerk and Giorgio Moroder, the 60s/70s German bubblegum pop songwriter/artist-turned-electronic disco pioneer (see Donna Summer's groundbreaking \\"I Feel Love\\")...DP tapped his talents and hijacked him into telling his story on the 9-minute epic \\"Giorgio By Moroder\\" over a cool electro-disco instrumental track...so it seems DP turned the focus away from themselves and onto their OWN influences...another all over this record is Nile Rodgers, guitarist/songwriter/producer from Chic, who combined funk, disco and rock into his distinctive jangly style...he also played with and produced Madonna, Duran Duran and others...his sound is all over RAM, which adds nice flavour.  Another guest is artist/songwriter Paul Williams on \\"Touch\\", a nice epic track about a robot striving to be human...love how it goes from Burt Bacharach/Carpenters-esque vocal track to Pink Floyd prog, to a sublime sci-fi disco explosion in the middle, wow!!<br /><br />This record is really interesting, how it goes on all these UNtrendy tangents and directions...but ties it all together as a unified whole, and makes it all cool...remember how Huey Lewis & The News did \\"Hip To Be Square\\"??  Well, they take that concept and turns it on it's head...they take Squaredom and make it retrofuturistic...70s Mellow Disco, Jazzy 70s Soft/Yacht Rock a la Boz Scaggs/Christopher Cross/Ambrosia/Michael McDonald...they mix it with spacey Pink Floyd Prog, DP's trademark vocodered vocals (but you can understand their words now), and this concept of robots striving to be human...<br /><br />And I didn't even mention the hit single from this album, the Pharrell-assisted \\"Get Lucky\\" yet...it doesn't even SOUND like a 2013 hit single, it's so out of place, but because of that, it stands out more...its melody and hooks creep on you and reminds me of Donna Summer's 1979 minor hit, the Giorgio-produced \\"Walk Away\\", the musical hooks, not the vocal hooks...plus I'm not a fan of the Strokes, but Julian Casablancas' appearance on \\"Instant Crush\\", that's a good song...best thing he ever appeared on.<br /><br />It's like (as someone said before), a time machine was used to place DP squarely in 1978/1979 when both Disco and Yacht Rock were at their peak on US radio (not mentioning powerpop or punk/new wave, superior songforms at that very same time, YET disco and YR made as much as an impact on me growing up)...DP placed themselves in those styles and also hijacked them back to the future to 2013...and they pull it off...<br /><br />Now, I love their prior records, but it seems every one is different and DP is evolving in unexpected ways...RAM is unexpectedly warm and  also shows their talent and skill as songwriters, musicians and arrangers, full of interesting ideas, and ambitious enough to pull it off...even Burt Bacharach would be impressed with this...this record I would not be surprised if it wins some Grammys...even for the quality of recording...it would sound great on vinyl...it has that warm sound...and one thing I'm loving is how RAM is throwing everybody off...best to expect the unexpected...don't place these guys in a box...or anyone else...NO ONE has a \\"typical\\" sound...no musician wants to be expectedto do the \\"expected\\"...this record is proof why...<br /><br />KUDOS Daft Punk!!to do the \\"expected\\"...this record is proof why...<br /><br />KUDOS Daft Punk!!

B00CW665VI|5.0|This was one outrageous and hilarious read. I'm in love with Drew despite being a douchebag that he is albeit a sexy one . Enjoyed reading about how this man whore ( here's me dropping a dollar in the swear jar) fell really, really hard for Kate. All of Drew's sexist thoughts about women, sex and Hilary Clinton had a CK Louis -type of flavor to them. You know it's not the PC thing to do but you can't help but bust out laughing. The love scenes were steamy without the porn-induced boredom that some sex scenes can evolve to. I normally dislike grovel scenes as they can get too embarrassing but the grovel portions were quite hilarious. Liked Kate but adored the sister aka The Bitch and enjoyed all the other secondary characters from the nun to Drew's buddies and Kate's friend Dolores Warren.. Read, read this one. To Emma Chase, you rock and please don't bother going on book tours just please pretty please get started on your new book. (Does it have to be a series? Don't care for them but let me shut up and let me you do your thing). Maybe you can put your kids up for temporary adoption so the next book can come out sooner.

B00CBR9S44|3.0|\\"The Grandmaster\\" is yet another retelling of Ip Man's life that is portrayed by Tony Leung this time around. The Chinese martial arts film mostly takes place between 1930 and 1952 with Ip Man's time in Foshan, his journey to Hong Kong once the Japanese invaded Foshan, becoming a martial arts master, and a brief mention of his death in 1972. Gong Yutian (Wang Qingxiang), a master from the North, comes to the South to hold a ceremony naming Ma San (Zhang Jin) as the heir to the North. After Gong Yutian encourages the South to do the same, the furious Northern masters are dealt with by Ma San rather effortlessly and Ip Man is called in to pick up the pieces. Worried that her father may lose a fight for the first time ever, Gong Yutian's daughter Gong Er (Zhang Ziyi) tries to convince him to not confront Ip Man. Their fight evolves into a battle of wits that has Ip Man walk away triumphant. \\"The Grandmaster\\" then evolves into not only a film chronicling Ip Man's life but also martial arts in general.<br /><br />As of this writing, \\"The Grandmaster\\" has yet to be released in the U.S. The Weinstein Company has secluded the rights to the film, has changed the name of the film to \\"The Grandmasters,\\" and looks to have set an August 23, 2013 theatrical release date for the film. If last year's \\"Dragon\\" is anything to go by, then The Weinstein Company is bound to make a few edits to the 130-minute duration of \\"The Grandmaster.\\" What's unfortunate is the rough cut of the film was originally four hours long and so much of the film was cut that the second half of the film is kind of sloppy. So if The Weinstein Company decides to cut away even more then the film won't be salvageable or even watchable at all. What's more is director Wong Kar-wai says the 4-hour version doesn't exist and currently has no plans for that version ever seeing the light of day. So what you see is what you get with \\"The Grandmaster.\\"<br /><br />What remains is this kind of beautiful disaster. The cinematography is absolutely extravagant. Fight scenes tend to play out in slow-motion, but its use of vibrant colors is just brilliant. You have this visual feast with the way the film feeds you glorious colors like red, green, gold, and even shades of white and black. The extraordinary set pieces and intricate costumes authenticate the time period while elements such as rain, snow, broken glass, and shimmering eyes that pull you in are utilized in ways to make every scene optically stunning. The down side is that there's always this really intense lighting used, especially during the rain and train station sequences, that seems really unnatural because of its intensity and time of day or night it's supposed to portray. The editing of the film is already off thanks to the film being chopped up, but it's even more so thanks to the way things are thrown into slow-motion so often for no reason. It's like the frame rate changes and everything becomes noticeably sluggish. Maybe it's just a DVD issue, but it becomes extremely distracting given the film's length.<br /><br />The action may make or break your opinion of the film, as well. The film is not just fight scene after fight scene as there's quite a bit of downtime, but the action is also a bit over exaggerated at times. There's quite a bit of wire work as natural elements and physics bend to these martial arts masters; stone walls are kicked through, a carriage is crushed with a single kick from each side at the same time, and characters defy gravity at times seemingly just because they can. It's not quite as overdone as some of Jet Li's films and is still pretty enjoyable overall, but if you can't stand wuxia films and are very stubborn about only liking realistic martial arts films then it could be an issue for you.<br /><br />The narrative is seriously flawed. Most of this can be blamed on the cut of the film, but the film will jump from Ip Man to Gong Er's pursuit of Ma San and stay on that for something like 30 minutes straight before jumping back to Ip Man and then having a random flashback to 1940 when the film has already touched on topics in 1950. Then there's The Razor character who is completely butchered (pun intended). The character is introduced, has an incredible action sequence and one other noteworthy scene but is never seen again after that. You never even get to see him confront Ip Man, which seems like a huge selling point for the film.<br /><br />This is a two-disc DVD set after all. There's bound to be something in the special features. Disappointingly enough, the special features are incredibly weak and aren't even translated into English on the Hong Kong all region DVD release. There are no deleted scenes or anything of much importance. The Making of section is mostly interviews and some behind the scenes stuff with each of the main characters, which gives you a brief glimpse at scenes that didn't make the film. Also included is the trailer, posters, a photo gallery, and cast and crew member bios.<br /><br />\\"The Grandmaster\\" is absolutely breathtaking to watch as its cinematography is gloriously rich and the action sequences are executed beautifully. Tony Leung is fantastic as Ip Man as his confidence shines through every scene he's a part of. The conversation he has with Zhang Ziyi near the end of the film at the teahouse is particularly emotional and heartbreaking. The film suffers from really awkward edits though. Despite its camera work being clean and crisp, the rest of its presentation is completely unbalanced. If you can get past what could have been, \\"The Grandmaster\\" is still enjoyable but pales in comparison to Wilson Yip's \\"Ip Man\\" films.es straight before jumping back to Ip Man and then having a random flashback to 1940 when the film has already touched on topics in 1950.

B001KZG99A|4.0|I wanted to see Iron Man 3 with my and had never seen any. My sister recommended that I see the first one to get the idea of the story line. It was very well made, special effects were spectacular, the idea of the story came through and I loved the asides Robert Downey Jr. made in many of the scenes. It made the dialogue mature, sarcastic, and funny. I liked it, but not enough to watch it twice - the deciding factor for the 5th star.

You have to Go Outside on a Summers Night after watching this movie and look up into the heavens and the Star Dappled Sky and Wonder, at the scene before You, at Life, at what might be Out There and Her words Buzz in Your Ears and Mind..&#34;You Know The Universe is a pretty big Place, and if We are all that there is, Well, that would be a Big waist of Space, now Wouldn't it?

B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book made me happy and sad. It also reminds me of another book called Stolen by Lucy Christopher. Words can't even describe how amazing this book was.

The 3D is great... and all should know that there are 4 levels to this game (as of May 2013). Would seriously hope for more levels or at least a sequel.<br /> Nice job! A+

HORTON HEARS A WHO seems immediately so endearing, like some half forgotten friend we once grew up with. Hard to explain. Just feel it. The images, sights and sounds and story are beautiful and together very enjoyable and heart warming. I love this film.

B006LSZECO|2.0|I felt like I put a lot of time and effort trudging through this book to get to the ending which I thought would be surprising or earth shattering but it wasn't. I do not recommend this book. Very disappointing. I did all that reading for nothing. It was just an unsatisfying read.
0385737947|3.0|The book is ok.  Not much else to say about it really.  The premise is very interesting, but the characters aren't very well developed and there could be more description of the environment.  I think the movie might be better than the book as long as they develop the characters a little better.
B00CRS5HII|5.0|I love this album, its simply amazing!! Everyone should add this to their collection. I cant stop listening to it.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|Started out thinking this show would be dumb, but ended up being a great show.  The CGI is pretty bad, and the main actor (Tyler Posey) aren't very good (though they both get better in the second season).  What really sold me on the show was the character of Stiles - the best friend and comic relief - played amazingly well by Dylan O'Brien.  Seriously one of the best characters on television, both for humor and emotional depth.  Also, I really enjoyed the soundtrack in every episode.  It's one of the few TV shows that's shot almost like a movie instead of a TV show.
B002RI90WM|5.0|A book that comes from a place and a &#34;person&#34; who bears witness to the human experience. If you want to read a book of hope, of love and of triumph of the human spirit, read this. And trust me, your tail will wag, and the rain will no longer slow you down.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Deborah Harkness has created a masterpiece with A Discovery of Witches! Intelligent, intriguing, and most of all exciting historical fiction. I wasn't sure I could get into a book about vampires and witches, but Ms. Harkness really engages the reader and requires that the reader use their mind to understand the many layers of her characters. Highly recommended.

B00C7O8TSM|5.0|As someone who considers myself to be a huge Beach Boys fan, but never got the chance to see them live in concert, I was both excited and sceptical, when I noticed that they were releasing a 2-CD recording of their \\"50th Anniversary Tour\\". Excited because the old live albums from the 60s and 70s were fairly \\"skimpy\\", missing too many favorites, but sceptical because I was thinking that back then they were young men and at the top of their game, and now they are old and perhaps much less capable of delivering those captivating harmonies. As stunning as their lead vocals and harmonies sound on their latest (and probably last) album \\"That's Why God Made The Radio\\", that was after all a studio recording. But I need not have worried. The \\"boys\\" sound absolutely wonderful. Pretty damn well done for a bunch of guys in their 70s, I must say.<br /><br />And then there's the comprehensive setlist, a very satisfying and generous selection of familiar hit singles and fan favorites. I would definitely recommend this live album to any Beach Boys fan. And if you don't own any of the live albums from their classic period (\\"The Beach Boys In Concert\\" from 1973, \\"Live At Knebworth\\", recorded in 1980), I highly recommend those, too.<br /><br />Volt-and-Volume.com
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Les Miserables is truly a chronicle of the human condition.  Love, hate, misery, ecstasy all take their turn in the telling the tale of Jean Val Jean.  It is truly great literature although I would have appreciated shorter descritions of the many detours taken in the story to explain situations and new characters who become factors in the story later on.
B00000JR29|5.0|This is the record I remember most from my teenage years. The majority of the songs that Tears For Fears is known for came from this one.  This is the one that I remember Casey Kasem talking about on the countdown. For me, TFF's entire reputation was built on this album, and deservedly so.<br /><br />It's hard to review an album that you have that kind of history with, even considering that I didn't even own a copy. It's hard to scrutinize the music of your youth, because it's a part of you.  It helps make up your identity - it's in your DNA, so to speak. Obviously, and for reasons that will be clear to any listener, I love this album.<br /><br />Favorite tracks:  Mothers Talk, The Working Hour, Broken<br /><br />The one that snuck up on me:  The Conflict.  I thought it was an instrumental at first, but the lyrics are poignant and lovely.
0812550706|5.0|I read this on recommendation from a trusted friend and enjoyed it immensly.  The story was very believable and well written.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B00000K413|5.0|In ordering and listening to the entire Tears For Fears back catalogue, this was one of the last albums I received, so to a degree I was working backward.  I don't think it would have mattered, though; this album is a monster.  What a hell of a debut.  &#34;Raw&#34; and &#34;gritty&#34; aren't usually words I think of in relation to early '80s pop, but those are the two that kept occurring to me as I listened through.  I imagine this album made the powers that be sit up and pay real close attention.<br /><br />Favorite tracks:  Suffer The Children, Ideas As Opiates<br /><br />The one that snuck up on me:  Start Of The Breakdown. This one is so pointed and anguished that I think I shied away from it at first.  It was really kind of a shock to hear one's own thoughts echoed in a pop song recorded 30 years earlier.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I was hesitant about this mouse because I have never heard of Anker. To my surprise, this mouse is absolutely awesome. Response is fantastic and the color options are plentiful. Highly recommend!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Again, Mr Jackson has made Tolkien books into total entertainment.  His movies are actually better than the books as they narrow down the myriad characters that Tolkien presented in his books.  I wasn't sure I would like this since it was a prequel to Lord of the Rings, but the photography, the musical score, and the cast once again made film history.  Totally loved it.
0307346617|3.0|Interesting narrative as a collection of interviews, hearing the apocalypse story from different voices, ages, genders and nationalities. Some of the stories are more compelling than others. The opening story from China, where the outbreak is thought to have originated gives you a chilling taste of what's to come.  The tale of blind Japanese man who managed to survive and thrive despite his \\"limitations.\\" Zombie tales are highly popular now. Without having seen the film adaptation (but saw the trailer), I think this book would be better served as an episodic television show produced by the folks who brought us Walking Dead or Game of Thrones.
B005LAIIHG|3.0|The Oscar's love of everything non-Christian is proven yet again.  What a bunch of bunk.  Trying to make India some surreal paradise in this fantasy really amazed me, since India has an 80% poverty rate that makes our poor in the United States look rich.  The story was nothing out of the ordinary and was mildly entertaining.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I saw the movie and got interested in the book version. I read the three books in three days. I haven't done that in years. Great reading for all ages.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Ann Hathaway truly deserved an Oscar for her character.  Surprised that Russell Crowe, who has excelled at almost everything he has done, was stiff and expressionless, but a great voice.  Hugh Jackson and the rest of the cast did so well in portraying their characters.
B004XZR63M|5.0|The books helps shine the light on lifestyles so many of us live yet the lifestyle so many of us want to live.  Easy read, fun, and highly recommend to people of all ages.
0446541478|3.0|Good book. Slow at times but very intereresting. Not sure I would buy it a second time. Like I said, it is interesting reading, however.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really like this game.  I get annoyed with puzzle games that have a ridiculous story line than shows down the play.  This one is all puzzles and fun.  A real challenge.  I can't wait to see what's next!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|A little slower in the beginning but it all comes together nicely in the end.<br />Excited to see what happens next - in a few years from now ;)
0345479092|5.0|Could not put this book down. Was very helpful in preparing for baby daughter. The tips are practice and presented in very engaging manner
1451629192|5.0|This was a hard book to get through and a sad story. It really lets you in on how horrible things were for her for those lost years.
0760703329|5.0|for a collector, a student, or any new to Shakespeare lover, this is a beautiful full book of his works
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I loved this book and can't wait to read the next one - Surely with the way it ended there has to be another one!!  I have enjoyed all three of The Clifton Chronicles!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it so much and I love horses so much it is so cool playing this game like I said I love it
B005USZML4|3.0|It was a cute story, but the Theodore Boone stories pale in comparison to John Grisham's REAL works. Almost as if he is writing for middle school kids or something.
B001GMQALY|1.0|The acting, music, and entire theme of this movie was just......yuck. I had never seen it and wish I never did.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This was a really fun and mind twisting game. How however I just wish it would have been longer. Can't wait for the next part.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Excellent book with some things that I already knew about Tesla and many things that I did not. The timeline of the facts as they were presented explains in much further detail the struggles of this fascinating man and his relentless persistence. Interesting book. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
0783228457|4.0|Great movie. Surreal experience and Cronenberg's best film. DVD is basic and there's a criterion collection version I would recommend more.
0812982622|5.0|I got the book in a timely manner.  It was very affordable and in great shape.  It was an excellent, although very disturbing, read. Many thanks.
B009B8YZIK|5.0|finally they made a halo movie. this was really great you need to see this movie if your a halo fan and if your not its still a really good action movie.
0385349947|4.0|Good message, nothing mind blowing, but a good reminder and helpful insight.  Would recommend to anyone in the workforce (male or female) as well as anyone raising girls.
B009AMANH4|5.0|If you like to see real politics in action, with great acting and deep subject matter, this is one of the best. It makes you wonder if today's politicians work as hard as Lincoln did. He was a great president
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Les Mis is heart-wrenching and comforting at the same time.  Although Hugo's level of intimate detail is sometimes in excess of the necessary, I learned so much about French history and human personalities in the same book.  A slow read, but I feel real accomplishment and pride in having finished it.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|great story, action packed the story flowed along great. like the bringing back of DATA  i highly recomend it to anyone
B004SUWR2C|1.0|I purchased this product a week ago and I have not seen it load on my kindle as yet. I does not work!!!!  Waste of time and energy trying to install it and there is no feedback forum.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I've bought every cd by Bocelli since I first heard him so many years ago. He takes me out of this world. I just bought two of the Passione cd's. One for myself and one for my brother,who is just as wild about Bocelli as I. This Passione cd is so romantic. I played it all day when I first received it. OMG,sat down on my sofa with a glass of wine, and I was in Portofino. Wonderful!!! Wonderful!!!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|This album is so much more than just &#34;radio hits&#34;.  If music can give me chills in 80 degree weather, that tells me it's pretty amazing, and this album did just that!
B00A7YZ1KI|2.0|I've grown so fond of the Sookie-universe these last few years, and in the weeks leading up to the release of DEA, I read every one of them again. Each book has been gone by a couple of days, and I've been eager to open the next.<br />However, my excitement has wavered slightly with the last couple of books, and this finale has left me completely unsatisfied and without closure.<br />The plot seems uninspired, the return of characters unnecessary. Mrs Harris fills page after page with detailed descriptions of the food Sookie makes, the garden blooming and random emails - while the usual drama and romance is oddly lacking.<br />Eric is doesn't make much of an appearence, and when he does, it is without his well-known passion, deviousness and vigour. And considering how big a part he has played in the last nine books that just seems.. weird. (If this was a movie I'd think the actor was on paternity leave, ha ha)<br /><br />I expected so much more.<br />And, although this is totally just my personal opinion, I would have wished for a less happy (and unjustified), perhaps more open, ending.<br /><br />Good-bye, Sookie
B000ASATZ8|4.0|I liked watching the Temors movies again, it has been a while. It is something fun to do from time to time. Too bad they didn't make a another movie or two either. But it did pretty good to have four movies made about the creatures along with a one season TV series.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|Awesome game, but I'm stuck on a story level and need money. So I go do smaller missions, and when I get back to the story mission, it freezes and shuts down without saving ANYTHING!!! (Kindle Fire)
B005LAIIKI|1.0|This movie was a silly remake of an old movie.  The usual Tarentino gory violence. A gunshot will make blood fly 20 feet.  Someone call Dexter.  Weak/silly story. Teenage boys should love it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I never imagined I would see so many heads slashed, gouged, severed, and shot in a program that I find addicting.
B00CKR63F2|5.0|The \\"beyond\\" aspect of Bridalveil Falls is not actually \\"above\\". It's under the water. Alas, \\"sink to a new level with this book\\" would have been a dreadful review title but the characters DO technically do that. They dive in the pool of water and come out on the other side of the falls. It's cool.<br /><br />Oria is a typical teenager - or so she thinks until her eighteenth birthday when she attends a family reunion at Bridalveil Falls. You know how it is with family reunions...surprises here, there, and everywhere: \\"Surprise! The macaroni salad went bad!\\", \\"Surprise! Guess who's having a baby?\\", and \\"Surprise! Uncle Bob had sex change surgery, so say hi to Aunt Barbara.\\" Typical family reunion stuff. But for Oria, typical isn't on the family reunion menu. Nope. Oria has a bite to eat then jumps in the water for a quick swim and - surprise! - she comes out on the other side of the falls, and to a brand new reality.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book's mix of magic and the mundane. I also liked the plot, characters, and I really had fun imagining the Native American aspects. It will be an especially enjoyable read for those who like shape-shifting stories with a touch of romance (not too much, just enough for added spice). The story is quick-moving, charming, and even peppered with bite-sized morsels of wisdom.<br /><br />I recommend this book for YA readers up, especially those with an interest in Native American lore.
B005544V6A|4.0|I like the actors and the style of this series.<br />Harvey especially. So sarcastic and cynical no to mention the fun he makes of the poor Louis.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Fun graphics and gameplay. You can actually win the game! March three type game. can you get free? I did! Posted without a glitch!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|If you could go back in time and change important historical events, would you?  I have been a skeptic when terrible things happen to friends and they put their minds at ease by saying, \\"It was for the best.  It all works out according to God's plan.\\"  Stephen King challenges this sense of karma by allowing a man, Jake, to undertake a self-imposed mission to save JFK from being murdered by Oswald.  The \\"butterfly effect\\" is employed effectively by King.  I was left wondering what would be the unforeseen consequences if you could change events.  I was made nostalgic by King's descriptions of life in 1958-1963 and he triggered memories of a simpler time when I was a young child.  In a way, I was transported back in time through Stephen King's written words.  I recommend reading this book.
B006IYG5HE|4.0|References to geographical areas can become burdensome, but the basic story is a spellbinder. Harry Hole is a very interesting protagonist.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|A movie adaptation of this book would be visually enthralling because of the descriptions of various tents in the circus.  I enjoyed the narration of the night circus and the mysterious tone the author evoked.  The ending seemed to wrap up rather suddenly and was too pat.  The pace of the story seemed to shift abruptly and left me unsatisfied at the conclusion.  Still, I enjoyed the book and haven't read anything else quite like it.
B00AALHW6Y|4.0|Hootie and the Country Music. This album is full of great modern country music, with the Bob Dylan penned \\"Wagon Wheel\\" currently the #1 song on the Billboard Country Airplay chart. Almost all of the songs here sound like they could be hit singles, it will be interesting to see which ones will be chosen.
B0097K21YW|4.0|I really don't have anything negative to say. Fun free little game. I enjoy it as much as Angry Birds
B00026WU7I|5.0|Bob Dylan's peak, and one of the finest albums in the history of recorded music, on par with Songs in the Key of Life and Rubber Soul. His marriage was falling apart, which caused Bob to write the most heartfelt music of his career, never matched before or since.<br /><br />The leadoff track, Tangled Up in Blue, is Bob Dylan's greatest song. An acoustic storytelling epic so good, the album would still be five stars regardless of anything else.<br /><br />The rest of the album is filled with stone-cold classics, including Shelter from the Storm, Idiot Wind, and the mournful If You See Her, Say Hello.<br /><br />If you're one of the people who \\"just doesn't get Dylan\\" and have nothing of his, this is the album to start with.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I love commedies and TED is hillarious! I truly thought a movie like this wouldnt be that good but it is. I normally dont like the volgur langauge but its in such good humor you have no choice but to laugh
B00CM96A60|5.0|one of the very few trance albums out there where you will love most of the songs and it's a must buy.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters in 3D and I really wanted to see it again. It was still just as good. It really is a long movie but the depth of the movie is great.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|I have a GoPro Hero 3 Black.  Used the camera a few times without the Touch BacPac and didn't realize how difficult it was to set up the camera until I installed this BacPac, it is so much easier with the Touch screen to both view settings and see what your are filming.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I have seen this movie about 6 or 7 times now and I cant get enough of it! I'm glad the musical movies are no longer cheesy like high school musical. I was nervoue about how Anna Kendrick would do coming from the Twilight Saga to this and I must say shes awesome! But Fat Amy really takes the movie with her comedy.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|Great game, love the graphics, fun and easy to understand. I would recommend this game, Paper Galaxy, to everyone! YAY
B00AYB0SX4|5.0|I love Jennifer Lawrence and I was excited to see her outside of The Hunger Games. She really is a great actress and the movie is done really well. Its one of the types of movies where you think you know but you have no idea. Its really not that scary or gruesome so I reccomend it highly.
1439170916|5.0|As a recent cancer survivor - Stage I testicular cancer, and by recent, I mean my hair hasn't grown back from the chemo yet - I found myself wanting to learn more about the disease, and not just handouts from the hospital or a skim of the American Cancer Society's website, as useful as those are.  That's when I recalled seeing The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer on some award-winner lists a while back.  Indeed, oncologist and writer Siddhartha Mukherjee's 2010 book was a recipient of the Pulitzer Prize in 2011, and after reading it with the added weight of my own experience, I highly recommend it to anyone looking to better understand this medical terror and how we - patients, doctors, researchers, drug companies, society - got to where we are today in our understanding and treatment of cancer.<br /><br />Mukherjee goes all the way back to ancient Egypt in starting his tale, and does a very good job of chronicling the understanding different times and places had of cancer.  From the bad humors of the ancient Greeks to the gruesome surgeries of the early modern era to the late 20th century guesswork of chemotherapy protocols, to today's search for genetic causes, you'll see how patients were treated, what doctors could or couldn't do, and what research if any was being undertaken.<br /><br />One thing I grew to appreciate from this tour through cancer's history is how lucky I am.  My father and his older brother both also had testicular cancer.  Reading The Emperor of All Maladies, I discovered that when my uncle had it in the early '70's, chemo for that kind of cancer was still not perfected which is why he didn't get it, that cisplatin, which was the foundation of both my dad's early '80's chemo and mine, was first human-tested in the mid '70's, and that the anti-nausea drugs I had access to - as imperfect as they are - didn't even exist until the late '80's, which is part of why my dad's chemo experience was so much worse than mine.  It's amazing to me that treatment for the same kind of cancer - and not even one of the ones with it's own color ribbon - has progressed so rapidly just in two generations, and Mukherjee does an excellent job of tracking all these developments.<br /><br />Mukherjee's writing is excellent.  If I didn't know he was an oncoloogist, I'd swear he was a novelist.  He keeps the book moving quickly, and is adapt at covering all the different parts of the story.  One of the major things he does that impresses me is how he always keeps a human face on what he's describing.  Learning about the researchers and doctors who have been crucial to cancer's story makes their efforts and their struggles more understandable.  But Mukherjee is an oncologist and researcher himself, so one would expect him to get that part of the humanization down.  What's really impressive is his ability to keep those afflicted by cancer at the center of the story and how the suffering, triumphs, and failures they experience are impacted by the state of medicine at the time of their diagnosis.<br /><br />Mukherjee does a good job of explaining things so that those without a medical background will be able to follow along.  All of my degrees are in the social sciences, as opposed to biological or chemical, but I was able to understand Mukherjee's scientific descriptions well.  My wife is a genetic counselor, so I did have a fair idea of how modern cancer genetics is understood, even before Angelina Jolie made BRCA1 front page news, but I don't think the average reader would have trouble following along with Mukherjee's explanations.  He manages to describe the science in an easily understood manner without feeling like he's talking down to you - truly remarkable for a doctor!<br /><br />I highly recommend The Emperor of All Maladies, whether you're a cancer survivor, a concerned family member, or someone lucky enough not to have cancer hit close to you yet.  Mukherjee is a fantastic writer, who ably brings the science to the reader and he addresses all the different facets of the story of cancer well in this book.  It's easy to see why this book won the Pulitzer.o the reader and he addresses all the different facets of the story of cancer well in this book.  It's easy to see why this book won the Pulitzer.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|I love Nicholas Sparks and truly enjoy reading his novels, and that is what makes this movie go south for me. Don't get me wrong it was a great movie but if youve read the book you become very critical. Most Nicholas Sparks movies are well done and stick more to the book than this. I do not like when back stories that make the character who they are and names of characters are changed. It really looses the book. Her past is different and it really takes away from who she is. I reccomend NOT reading the book before the movie or you will ruin it for yourself.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|First of all, I love the Plantronics Voyager line of Bluetooth earpieces!  So I was just looking for a small case to store my Voyager Legend because my old Voyagers always ended up getting damaged at the top of the earpiece from constant handling.  So I figured a case would help protect it so it would last longer.  Not only does it protect my Voyager Legend but it also charges it at the same time!  The charging aspect is key because Plantronics intentionally created a poor method to charge the Legend so that you would almost be forced to purchase this charging case.  In fairness, one area of the Voyager bluetooths that often broke was the mini-USB connection.  For some reason after countless times of connecting/disconnecting the mini-USB charging cable, the mini-USB port would get loose and then not allow a proper connection to charge the device.  So maybe Plantronics was attempting to fix this problem???  Regardless, the Voyager Legend requires a special cable to charge it (it comes with the Voyager Legend but it is only about 4 inches long!) whereas this charging case can be charged with a micro-USB connection (which is pretty standard these days).  So I always charge the charging case with my micro-USB charging cable and then when my Voyager Legend needs to be charged (which is not often) then I just put it in the charging case.  I also put it in the charging case when I travel for protection.<br /><br />Bottom line, this charging case is the perfect complement to the Voyager Legend!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I enjoy this game. I find myself playing periodically throughout the day. I would have given this a 5 star if there were some instructions...I have been guessing my way through. I would like to know how to play the game, what each power means, how points are awarded, etc. I am not sure if I am playing correctly but I like playing, with the little information I do know.
B000FA675C|5.0|I read this years  back when it first came out and now rereading on the Kindle. I love the book and look forward to the latest addition to the Robert Langston saga when the new book comes out.
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|I thought this was wonderfully thought out.  Time travel is something that's been talked about for years and this was an interesting take on things.<br /><br />Fantastic
B004VMUS9G|5.0|There are a multitude of settings that cater to the kind of person you are in the morning and the sort of sleeper you are- deep or light.  Maybe you need obnoxious noise or just a quiet reminder.  The wake up prompts range from obnoxious ringtones to soft music to vibrations.<br /><br />Bottom line:  GET IT!
B0094LU2TU|2.0|Special effects mediocre, plot line jerky with awkward transitions, silly reasons for chase scenes, etc. Plot not well worked out, didn't engage me at all.  Very disappointed, since reviews and other publicity led me to hope it was thought-provoking.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|This was sent to me to fix the issues I have with my Kindle Fire not charging and it worked for about a month then quit.
B004FP1WX0|4.0|I am so glad someone thought to document online dating. When I was actively dating online, I always said I should record all the craziness that went along with it.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|I was given an ARC for a honest review. I'm a huge Bond fan so naturally I was intrigued but I didn't expect the story to be so gripping. This is pure entertainment from page 1. The historical context is well drawn and the characterizations feel fresh. I especially enjoyed the ski chase and the romantic sub plot. There's something here for everyone and I can't wait to read the next one in the series.
B008XCPO2Q|5.0|Channing Tatum is HOT so who cares what the movie is about? Just looking at him does it for me.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I  have enjoyed this series but hate being left hanging unless he plans another<br />book  which has not yet been announced.
0375758992|5.0|Don't Let's Go To The Dogs Tonight is an engrossing memoir of a girl's view of the Rhodesian conflict that played out through the 1970s to ultimately disastrous consequences.  In this book she lays out her parent's alcoholism, the loss of several brothers, and the conflict.<br /><br />Indeed from her view the war is a far off, but constant thing that pokes into her life on occasion. Her father is a reservist, her remote farm is near a minefield, they barely break even on their farm.<br /><br />A good memoir of an interesting place and time.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The last book was not as good as the first two. It was not a page turner, I would rate this book a 3.
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|Have been a fan since \\"Bastard\\" and really love this album, Saw him live after the release also. But overall, artwork is nice, comes with a few extra things and was really satisfied.
B009XEE0DW|5.0|This recording is Mylene's dance record. It's very cool dance with hints of the 1990's sound but her unique style. Some of her songs have a rock sound, I love rock so there it is.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|As an adult you would think this would be to young. But I really have a good time with this app. I can recommend it for adult s and kids alike. It's easy and colorfull.

B000JML7EC|5.0|This was a very good and interesting and exciting book. Read it if you like interesting and exciting books. You will like it guaranteed.
B0000033IS|5.0|Aretha Franklin's Atlantic debut is the place where gospel collided with R&B and rock & roll to make soul music as we know it today.
B00C061I3K|4.0|Probably like most first listeners, I was left wondering what exactly just happened with this album.  I had read in interviews before the album dropped that Daft Punk were looking to stray away from the sort of pre-programmed music era of EDM (not that they've ever been part of that) and that they were looking to bring back some real and authentic music.  Well they didn't lie because if you were expecting anything as their album predecessors, you're in for a rude awakening.  There were a handful of tracks that stood out to me at first and although you can catch a touch of their usual style here and there, Daft Punk truly did their best to sound anything but like the typical Daft Punk.  I can tell you that the majority of the album's tracks are very steady and slower tempo beats.  They've written slower tracks in the past but also had many harder and faster tracks.  You won't really find anything like that here.  Yet after I was left, not disappointed, but more like curious with what happened, I decided I had to give it another listen.  Well I don't know why but the second time around it felt so different.  I really started to appreciate every track on the album (not just the first few I liked).  Perhaps that was the intention of the guys.  First time around maybe not so much.  But the second or third, it started to make sense.<br /><br />I think many hardcore fans will give it a perfect rating simply because of their love for these guys.  But I've been listening to electronica and groups like Daft Punk for 15 years.  I enjoy them just as much as the next fan.  But I can't sit here and honestly rate it 5 stars.  What I can tell you is that I honestly enjoyed this album a lot.  It wasn't perfection by any means but the effort definitely deserves credit.  I think many of the mainstream electronica lovers will probably frown on this album and that's to be expected.  But I think real appreciators of electronica music will be able to see through this record and realize what a wonderful job Daft Punk has done.  It wouldn't surprise me if they return to their typical style in the next record which is fine. But for now, Random Access Memories is what we got and I believe both Daft Punk and ourselves are lucky for it.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|One of the most exquisite books I have read in a long time. If you enjoyed Memoirs of a Geisha, then this will certainly  be right up your alley. The detail of this book is so rich without being overdone. It is so exquisitely written. It draws you in from the very first sentence.  Nothing short of a masterpiece. True literature aficionados need to read this book. It is a treasure. The characters are fully developed so much so they appear realistic as my own friends. The book being about magic is ironic as the book itself is magical. I want to read it again and I hated for it to end.<br />5 Stars

B008TRUDAS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I was reluctant since there were many good reviews but I have been let down before; however, this time I was not. sweet story. I just i would contain a little more &#34; steamy hot scenes&#34; but overall it is a good P13 book to read
B007HACDLK|5.0|Always a fast and fun read.  Can't wait for more.  This book reminds me of the earlier books with Mitch in a great way.
0670026603|4.0|This is a story of acceptance.  Very well written and a memorable read.  Highly reccomended for men and women who have faced struggles and dilemmas in their own lives.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This story of amazing strength and survival is one you won't be able to put down. Jaycee writes with a very candid approach. From reading her memoir  I have learned a great deal about her view of life and what it took and what it takes to survive in a world full of the unknown. What an inspiration Jaycee is. What potential she has to help so many. I hope that she continues to affect people in such a positive way. May her future continue to be as bright and promising always. I cannot express enough what a great but difficult book this is to read. I don't think I have ever laughed or cried as much in reading one book as I did reading this one. Jaycee is a natural born writer. I hope she continues to write. I will purchase anything she writes without hesitation. I wish the best future for her and her girls.

B00CS65JS2|5.0|Don't listen to any of the whiny EDM kids. This CD is outstanding the range and talent they have is fully displayed here. If you have been listening to Daft from the start you have all notice with each album comes new things. This CD I feel shows their true range of how talented they really are. I will warn you if your looking for the everyday EDM music go buy a Skrillex garbage. But If your looking for a all around good vibe CD that puts you in good mood buy.
B008XTVWHK|5.0|What else does anyone need to say?  Forget the acting.  Purely secondary to the effects and music.  Just sit back in indulge in a guilty pleasure as you watch.

B0042RJWTM|5.0|Overlooked movie.  An excellent view of a changing world and those tough men trying to survive in it.  Quite bittersweet.  Excellent camera work and score.
B000M06SU4|5.0|I fully expected not to like this LP because I felt they were trying to improve on perfection. I enjoyed the album anyway. Wish they would put the same thing out with just the songs and no studio manipulations too, and want it pure analog, no digital manipulations like they did with the new remasters (2012 stereo). We want pure analog off the master tapes.

0307341550|4.0|I read this first novel of author Gillian Flynn after reading her best seller [[ASIN:030758836X Gone Girl: A Novel]]. I think that her ability with plot improved from this book to her third, but the thing I really enjoy about her writing, which is her insights into the interior lives of girls and women, is clear in this novel.<br />The story is a mystery which follows the main character Camille from her current home in Chicago, where she works as a journalist, to her childhood home in a small town in Missouri. She is going to report on two murders of little girls. She runs into many of her old high school acquaintances and becomes entangled in her mother's strange household, which includes Camille's much younger sister, Amma.<br />I won't spoil the mystery by revealing the killer, but, as I noted above, even if I did this book would be worth reading for Flynn's insights into girl behavior. The character of Amma is portrayed as the pretty beyond her years thirteen year old girl that tortured many of us in middle school...she has a gaggle of just slightly less pretty friends who follow her around and do her bidding. Through Amma, Flynn explores some of the dynamics of female friendships and female power.<br />Flynn's consideration of female culture isn't limited to Amma, and expands in her depiction of Camille, who is a damaged person who drinks and sleeps with inappropriate men to soothe herself. When reflecting on the health of the women she knows, Camille asks herself \\"Sometimes I think illness sits inside every woman, waiting for the right moment to bloom. I have known so many sick women all my life. Women with chronic pain, with ever-gestating diseases. Women with conditions. Men, sure, they have bone snaps, they have backaches, they have a surgery or two, yank out a tonsil, insert a shiny plastic hip. Women get consumed.\\" This as a really interesting interlude for me, considering the state of women as physical beings.<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in mysteries or in gender studies. The only reason I gave it four rather than five stars was that, unlike while reading Gone Girl, in this this book I was able to guess the \\"bad guy\\" almost from the beginning. However, the lack of suspense didn't keep from enjoying the book.nyone who is interested in mysteries or in gender studies.

0743487486|5.0|I agree that this book is lighter on practical daily tips than some others and heavier on philosophy, but it's one of the absolute very best parenting books I've read. The conceptual basis of changing the way parents view/speak to/treat children to become more respectful, kind, reasonable, and loving has completely changed our family's relationships. I wish I'd found this book when my first child was born (or before). It's a great companion to have in your library along with the Faber and Mazlish books (Siblings without Rivalry, How to Talk So Your Kids Will Listen & Listen so Your Kids Will Talk), Connection Parenting, Dr. Markham's Peaceful Parent, and Lawrence Cohen's Playful Parenting. There's also a DVD with this same title where Kohn gives a lecture based on the books, and it's great, too. Thank you Alfie Kohn!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just finished Wool and immediately purchased the Shift trilogy, even though I can see that the Shift books aren't a continuation of the Wool story, but prequels.<br /><br />I know this will frustrate me at first, as I'd really love to see how Silo 18 changes under new leadership and an altogether different approach to the truth. I wanted to see Juliette and her crew assembling strong suits and returning to Silo 17 to bring its inhabitants over to Silo 18 -- or maybe not, maybe groups of volunteers heading over to Silo 17 to help bring it back to life. I wanted to see the story go on and on as more minds armed with the truth of how their world came to be could work toward an eventual solution -- or come to realize that the earth's devastation had been complete, that the only hope for humanity was in those Silos, and the outcome of that realization.<br /><br />Maybe Mr. Howey will eventually give us those stories.<br /><br />In the meantime, I'm just happy to be able to read more of his work, especially his Wool prequels. I'm sure when I'm done with these, I'll scramble to download everything else he's produced....

193700788X|4.0|I honestly don't know why people are complaining about the final book.<br /><br />All the characters and storylines were wrapped up neatly. Everyone was addressed. Sookie got what we knew she always wanted, the most normal life possible. (And really her choice was a great choice for her.) My only qualm is the uncertainty of the last page. I would have liked to know for sure instead of something ambiguous...but I guess that is what after dead is about.

Between the beautifully described imaginings of the author and the fresh exciting story, I truly feel like I lived this story. It's a great escape book, I think is best experienced on a winter weekend when life has reached a particularly mundane pace. This book will make you look for magic, and believe in it even if you don't find it. Superbly spectacular!

B00AO686MY|1.0|The Blue ray disk wouldn't play.  The regular DVD did.  I enjoyed the movie, as I have in the past.
B00A0SLTCU|1.0|And Blade Runner? This movie just sucks all the way. It's a nightmare to watch, from the prolonged escape sequence to the stylized kung fu fights, to a storyline that makes AVP seem an Oscar winner. I don't usually side with the critics, but this time they are absolutely right.
B0049IHX2C|3.0|Oh dear, the sequel, a bad idea in every regard, and yet they did it to us anyway.<br /><br />I can't help but cringe when I think about this movie.  More of an anemic remake than the next logical progression in the franchise.  They took the same basic idea of an alien villain crash landing on Earth, check.  Made said alien a woman this time, who also has to come up with a human disguise, check.  But, instead of doing something inspired, they went the Critters route, and had her duplicate a photo in a magazine.  Naturally, as with the first film, this villainess (played with stupefying  numbness by Lara Flynn Boyle) is after something........the light of Zartha.  Check.  Been there, done that (a lot better).  They also dragged back poor Tony Shalhoub as Jack Jeebs then didn't give him anything fresh to do (we get it, his head grows back).  Rip Torn was as funny as humanly possible doing the same thing he did in the first film.  Johnny Knoxville, unfortunately, was anything but funny, and he had two heads to work with.  Worst of all, they wasted their best talent (Tommy Lee Jones) by keeping him on the sideline for too long, then making him second fiddle to what's-his-name.  Out of desperation, they even included a scene with Michael Jackson and two repeat scenes with Peter Graves!<br />Nothing about this film really works, although it did the first time around.<br /><br />I've kept it because it's part of a series but that's as far as my loyalties will go.<br /><br />A bitter disappointment but not quite a dud.
B009IF82SK|5.0|the second half of this season especially shows how the show runners have put charliesheens drama behind them and put creativity on the front burner again..they aren't trying to win new fans with this season, just reward the existing ones with favorite story lines and inside jokes.
B0000640SB|5.0|A fabulously funny film that benefits from a great score by Danny Elfman, award winning makeup by Rick Baker, a great villain (Vincent D'Onofrio as Edgar the Bug), and of course Tommy Lee Jones as Agent K.  Rip Torn is hilarious as Chief Zed, the head of MIB.  Tony Shalhoub, as Jack Jeebs (an alien pawn shop owner), provides more than a few laughs on his own.  This movie is practically perfect.  The concept is snarky and fun at the same time.  It holds up well surprisingly well for a movie that's a decade plus.  There are a lot of scenes that are gems, starting with that poor dragonfly.  I had no idea this project was based on a comic book (so many are).  So it probably had a built-in fan base to begin with.  If you are into monster movies or Sci-Fi flicks, this one is a sure bet for anyone's collection.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|this show does not shy away from boldy taking a stand on re-interpreting well defined characters and, if not re-inventing them,..at least revamping them. I am a huge fan of Cumberbatch and the BBC show Sherlock,..and this in no way invades their space or diminshes the vim and vigor of either show. Lucy Liu owns her Watson and Johnny is just Fun whenever he is on screen...New fans of Holmes, and old ones will find much to lover here.
6304806418|5.0|The DVD is wonderful. We enjoy every minute of it. The sound is perfect. We added it to our collection. It was well worth the price.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This wasn't a chick flick, but it was a great date night movie. We loved it so much that we rented it to share with our teenaged son. He loved it too.  Plenty of laugh out loud moments, but also a spotlight on human nature, relationships, both romantic and familial, and an insight to our very nature and selves.  But did I mention? Funny!
B00336G7HI|5.0|Battery came as promised.very good price. Works great. Shipping was on time. This battery has plenty more recording time than the original p series.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Totally surprised by how different this album is from anything Daft Punk had done previously, it's definitely a breath of fresh air though, it has the disco 70's and 80's vibe, and they are still using the voice modulation for most of the tracks, but I love how live sounding the album is, the last time I had heard anyone use an actual, live orchestra to create a modern sounding album, or be moved by the music was back in 2003 'Furious Angels' LP from Rob Dougan, I haven't stopped listening to RAM since I got it three days ago.<br /><br />Mission accomplished Daft Punk, this music has a soul to it.

B0061PEAUY|4.0|I liked it specially because it keeps you guessing who the killer is, for me it's not worth it when you know the end at the beginning, suspense is what keeps a book interesting.

It explains in detailed depth about how they created the concept of Tomb Raider and detailed sketches, thumbnails and trial and errors. However, one thing I was disappointed in was there wasn't many images or concept art for Lara Craft, it would of been great to see how they executed lots of sketches and concept ideas!<br /><br />Overall a magnificent book, amazon packed it so beautifully! No bumps, dents, nor folded or creased edges on the book seriously a worthy book to buy ! MUCH MORE CHEAPER HERE THAN BUYING IT IN ACTUAL BOOKSTORES

B00B2QG3K2|4.0|I am admittedly a newcomer to Paramore.  This 2013 self-titled opus is my first album from them.  I read an article about the band in the local newspaper here and they sounded interesting, a Christian pop-punk/rock band, and then I saw the CD in the new releases rack at Kmart and decided to take the plunge and buy it.  I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />I find frontwoman Hayley Williams to be a very interesting individual.  She is a woman, undeniably very attractive physically, and yet she is 100% convincing as a genuine social misfit/outcast.  I am hit or miss about actually taking the time to read the lyrics to CDs that I buy, but I found Hayley's lyrics here to be very personal, sincere and human.  I also feel a kinship with her because she was born under the astrological sign Capricorn, just as I was, and we in this sign are known to sometimes be misunderstood and reclusive homebodies/introverts.  Hayley's lyrics to \\"Be Alone\\" read her like a book:  \\"What if I don't ever want to leave my house?/Stay on the couch while all my friends are going out.\\"<br /><br />\\"Be Alone\\" is by the way probably my favorite song here.  It's so honest and real.  It's the second to last song on the CD, and I find the album's second half to be the stronger of the two, as it also has the great second single \\"Still Into You.\\"  I can see why this song propelled the album all the way to the top of the charts for a time in April.  It's that good.  \\"Proof\\" has a chorus so catchy you will not get it out of your head for days.  And finally, the ballad that follows it \\"Hate to See Your Heart Break\\" is very soothing and emotionally rich, sounding like it would not be out of place on good Adult Contemporary radio.<br /><br />All in all, a great, positive leaning CD with lyrics you can really feel and tunes you can readily sing along to.  Highly recommended.

Your book is the first book i have ever started, and refused to finish, because it was just that bad.<br />A friend of mine who read the book pointed out that it was directed towards a younger crowd. How young is the author shooting for? 5?<br /><br />AND SERIOUSLY!!!  WTF is up with all the 5 star reviews?

B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I bought THE FAST DIET: LOSE WEIGHT, STAY HEALTHY, AND LIVE LONGER...,  by Michael Mosley and Mimi Spencer, for my Kindle after seeing a report about it on my local news channel (I haven't seen the documentary on this diet, also by the authors, but it's sounds interesting).<br /><br />That was about 9-weeks ago and so far I've lost 10-pounds. I'm not obese, just overweight and looking to lose about 20-pounds, and so that's why I wanted to try out this diet. I quit smoking about 5-6 years ago and gained about 30-pounds after that and it's been tough trying to lose that excess weight, even though I exercise, because I love to eat.<br /><br />Anyway, the book is well written, easy to read, and contains case studies and research into various diets that include some form of fasting. The authors experiment on themselves and come up with a plan that seems to work, actually be doable, and that's what they pass along to the reader.<br /><br />The book also has recipes and guidelines and what to expect when you begin.<br /><br />Really the plan is VERY SIMPLE: you simply fast on two non-consecutive days a week, not really fasting just eating 600 calories or less for men; 500 or less for women on those \\"fast\\" days, and eat whatever you like on the non-fast days. That's it.<br /><br />So technically you don't have to read this book to get started, and you can find recipes online for meals that are 500/600 calories, but by doing so you kind of cheat yourself out of the wealth of information that the authors supply in the book and why they arrive at 5:2 being the most successful plan of attack.<br /><br />What this really boils down to, and why it works, is simple math: by doing the 5:2 diet you're cutting out almost 4,000 calories a week for men (based upon Recommended Daily/dietary Allowance of 2,500 calories). You will lose weight by doing so.<br /><br />Another reason why it works it because you don't overeat on the normal eating days. I thought I was going to be ravenous the next day after a fast, but I wasn't. In fact, I just ate as I normally would. Another interesting phenomenon was that I thought I would be starving on those fast days but that wasn't the case at all, either. I just eat one-protein source (meat or fish) and lots of vegetables (broccoli or spinach or both) and maybe a salad. I might add in a protein shake if I'm still a little hungry, but that's it. Sometimes the protein shake would put me over the 600-calorie mark, but even still, I'm cutting out over 1,000 for that day, which is good.<br /><br />The 5:2 diet is totally customizable and you don't have to stick with it to the letter like other diet plans, which is why I believe is another reason it works. I've skipped several fast days because of plans that would make controlling calorie intake impossible and just continued on the following week, so it's not a big deal to miss a fast day when life happens to curtail it.<br /><br />I've seen newspaper reports that say how dangerous this diet is etc., and that people should stick with a normal diet blah-blah-blah, but if we could do that we wouldn't be overweight in the first place. However, this doesn't mean that you should throw out all commonsense when it comes to your dietary habits on normal days. You should still eat or strive to eat more vegetables and fruit on the days when you don't fast. This diet just makes it possible to cut calories without doing that every-single day, which can burn you out. And once you get down to your goal weight, you may cut back the fasting days to just once a week. Very do-able.<br /><br />I haven't tried any of the recipes that are in the book, for some reason I can't follow a recipe for one small meal because I feel like if I'm going to go through the trouble of preparing it that meal better last for more than just one sitting, but they look pretty tasty.<br /><br />Here's some tips that helped me get started:<br /><br />* Plan Meals In Advance (for your fasting days) *<br />Believe me you don't want to be figuring out what to eat when you've gone from morning to night with just 90-calories in your stomach. And eating out, unless you know for a fact how many calories are in the meal, isn't a good idea since you can't control how many calories you're consuming.<br /><br />* Know Your Body *<br />This was very important because I'm normally a very light breakfast eater, having no appetite the mornings, so I always eat just one Yoplait light (90-calories) for breakfast. When I started the 5:2 diet, I started getting or actually feeling light-headed before lunch, which is silly because I didn't do anything out of the ordinary on that day, so it was psychological. But you've got to know that before-hand otherwise you'd think it was really because of fasting.<br /><br />* Add An Egg To Your Meal *<br />This tip was given to me by another reviewer who read the book before me (thanks, Lee) and eggs, either soft or hard boiled, really fill you up.<br /><br />* Get A Calorie App *<br />I use both Calorie Counter (by Fat Secret) and My Fitness Pal, which are both available for free and work either for Android and iPhone OS (operating systems), and these apps help tremendously with keeping track of caloric intake. I think they work better than using a scale.<br /><br />* Green and/or Black Tea *<br />Have these tea bags on hand because they're great to drink on fast days because the warmth is comforting and they fill you up.<br /><br />Also, don't worry about your body going into starvation mode and holding onto every little calorie you eat because you aren't fasting for prolonged periods of time.<br /><br />I also recommend choosing your fasting days on the days when you have very little physical activity, at least in the beginning, until you find out how your body reacts to the drop in calories. I don't exercise on those days, although I feel that I can now, but I don't want to over do it.<br /><br />You'll also notice that your weight will go down dramatically after the fasting days, but tends to normalize after a few days of regular eating, so if you're going to record your weight and keep score, go by the number you get after eating normally. You can weigh yourself after the second fast day, but just know that your weight will go back up during that same week, giving the illusion that you're actually gaining weight (because that initial number is inaccurate and some of it is water weight that is lost), so it can be disheartening to see the scale going back up. A better barometer is how your clothes are fitting, but if you go by the other number you'll see that you'll be losing a pound a week or so.<br /><br />IF you have a physically demanding job that requires a lot of physical exertion, but then you'd probably be in good physical shape already, I wouldn't advise doing the fast on those days.<br /><br />This diet is NOT recommended for diabetics or people with eating disorders or young adults under the age of 18.ve me you don't want to be figuring out what to eat when you've gone from morning to night with just 90-calories in your stomach. And eating out, unless you know for a fact how many calories are in the meal, isn't a good idea since you can't control how many calories you're consuming.<br /><br />* Know Your Body *<br />This was very important because I'm normally a very light breakfast eater, having no appetite the mornings, so I always eat just one Yoplait light (90-calories) for breakfast. When I started the 5:2 diet, I started getting or actually feeling light-headed before lunch, which is silly because I didn't do anything out of the ordinary on that day, so it was psychological.

B00AYJCEVK|5.0|I just recently went to see Darlene Zschech live at our church and she is amazing.  Her heart is totally on Jesus.  I enjoyed this Limited Edition of a CD and DVD because it is live worship.  It was almost like watching her live again because she sang the same songs that are on the DVD as she did at our church concert/praise and worship. I recommend it to all who come across this, it is well worth the price.  Great price.<br />Revealing Jesus is exactly what Darlene Zschech did.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I loved the historic details of a time long past. The characters caught my attention and pulled me into the tale. However, there had better be a third book since this one didn't end, it left you hanging wondering was going to happen next.
B00742GBDM|4.0|I thought this was going to be super cheesy, but I ended up really enjoying it. I recommend watching it. The actors actually portrayed their characters well and the sets were beautiful. I recommend watching it!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great puzzles, keep you thinking! Wish it wasn't so short though, can't wait till there are more rooms! A must have app.
B00005JPS8|5.0|I was eager to see Iron Man but it was really good.  I received it exactly as I expected and it was in pristine shape.  Will order again.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a great app. u can play many games. once again it is a great game jack. hey jack
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Great movie must watch! The 3d is great and a wonderful movie over all.  James Cameron did an excellent job.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|Though this album has a different sound than the previous VW albums, it still somehow fits right into their repertoire. It's a bit more experimental but still has the playful jumble of influences that make VW sound like VW. Great for a barbecue or a summer drive.
