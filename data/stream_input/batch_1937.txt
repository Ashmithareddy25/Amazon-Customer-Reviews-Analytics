B003JTHXOK|3.0|I've read a few by Sparks and can't say that this is my favorite. Maybe it's because I find his books follow a formula - similar themes, similar values, similar characters - and I now know the formula too well. This seems almost exactly like The Lucky One except the girl is the out-of-towner and the guy has the kid from a previous marriage. In both cases the women are trapped by a controlling ex... and in both cases the controlling exes are police officers? More than the other books, however, is that I really didn't find the same character development in this as I appreciated in some of the others. I get the sense Katie & Alex get together because there aren't any other interesting people in town, not because they really have a connection. The surrounding characters too - Joyce, Roger, the kids, and even the purposefully odd Jo - are hollow and one dimensional. No quirks, no interaction.... just nothing.  I also got bored by paragraphs upon paragraphs of crazy Kevin's stream of drunken consciousness. I DO NOT BUY that Alex, a former MP who worked with battered women would have no idea how to help Katie. Nope...he of all people would know how to help her find a legal way to handle the situation. The \\"twist\\" was a snoozer and felt forced.<br /><br />Above all, I think I'll be passing on future Sparks books  because I'm finding his characters to be boringly one-sided. They are either fundamentally good or fundamentally evil. I don't buy Katie's debates with herself over whether sleeping with Alex is a sin. That's not a real dilemma given her situation. Dear John was an exception: there was no good or bad, just the difficulty that love and relationships face with distance and competing demands. If you're looking for another feel-good Sparks book with a bit of suspense, you may enjoy this but the more I think about it I would give this one 2 stars instead of 3. I feel like I've read the same book twice and I kinda want my $ & time back.
0439023491|5.0|My wife was the one who read these, she loved them, few book series cause her to stay up reading all night, this was one, Game of Thrones being the other.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|One of Wes Anderson's best films.  I must admit I am a big fan of this director and this is one of my favorites.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|&#34;Its fantastic&#34; words of my wife. Shes in love with the show, and she loves the music. She likes every song on it, and while one 'advertised' song wasn't on the album, amazon sent a credit to d/l it from their mp3 store.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I was very surprised by how much I liked this album.  It's far from my usual taste and I listened to it over and over again.
B000L212HC|5.0|This is one of those movies that has lots of twists and turns, and is played out really well, but not random, if you're really paying attention, you can figure out what's coming, or what the twists are. Even so, its an entertaining watch. One of those watch once every couple of years kind of movies. Great picture on the blu-ray. Disk and case arrived in great condition.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I love all of the Outlander books so far, and this one doesn't dissapoint! I look forward to reading the others in the series. Diana Gabaldon has a beautiful writing style!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I have not watched the new movie yet. I have been waching the original three.<br />I'm hoping Harrison has not lost his touch and movie number four is a hit.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|As a technology specialist for our church, I've used this in all of our buildings to locate and evaluate Wi-Fi access points and found it to be a godsend.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book from start to finish and could hardly put it down! I can't believe it was FREE, as I would've paid regular price for it. It wasn't the typical Harlequin novel  we've all come to think of. It wasn't as racy or graphic, but definitely steamy. I look forward to the upcoming books in this series.
B002N5N5R0|5.0|Great set for price - came very quickly and much satisfied<br />Cant stop watching it it is so great to watch
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It is well written and it keeps you wanting more.  It is a great series that I definitely recommend t others.
B003VTZTU8|5.0|Well written and researched.<br />Very funny in places.<br />I share the views on bogus alternative remedies and quacks.<br />Opened my eyes to a view things
8866131768|4.0|The binding and cover are just what you'd expect from Moleskine, but I'm a little disappointed by how thin the paper is. When I write with a gel pen or even a ball point, the writings are easily seen on the back side of the sheet. Everyone says how much they like the quality of the paper, but it's practically see-through!!!
B005GFPZYK|2.0|Extremely one sided and propagandist view.<br />I saw a guy, I killed a guy, I did it from far away. I did it for my country. I did it for the freedom of my children. I did it as a badass but it was very tuff......and so on and so on
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a nice, quick read book that I really enjoyed.  It kept me interested right from the beginning and it got better and better as you got near the end!
B0052TDGQO|4.0|I really liked most of the songs on this CD.  I liked him on American Idol and this is a solid first album.  The song &#34;Clear as Day&#34; was very emotional.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Love it! Love it! Love it! Love it! Love it! Love it! Love it! Love it! Love it!  Love it! I guess I would highly recommend it.
B00319ECGK|3.0|I am aware that this movie was shot with extra green in the scenes that occur inside the matrix, however, the screen came through too strong in the Blu Ray release.
B008GXHOFW|3.0|I played this game for a few weeks and it was awesome!!! but now I cant play it. when Im gonna play it and when I skipped the intro it takes me back to the main menu even when I don't skip the intro. I recommend you enjoy it until that problem happens 2 u.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Very deep and philosophical take on life and death. I loved the quirkiness and humor John Green uses for his characters
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun!graphics are great and I play it for hours. I just hope we can have the ability to make a character.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I thought this book was a real page turner and I just didn't want to put it down.  Good story line and an enjoyable reading experience.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It is fun, easy to understand and there are many levels to test your skill.  Why do you require a minimum number of words?
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|I tried it on a whim and enjoyed it very much, although the last book was a little disappointing.  It a series worth reading for all ages.
B0047WJ12K|4.0|Inception presents an interesting concept. However, the movie in general was disjointed and a bit confusing. That's not to say that I don't understand the underlying theme, and ultimate question presented to the viewer.<br /><br />The flaws appear to be in the directing; the story is sound and the acting is good. It's a fun movie to watch. I just wish it had been done better.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|I have two small children (7 and 4) and both were captivated by this movie... as were their parents!  Wonderfully entertaining movie and I'm sure the children will ask to see this one again!
B008ZOHCKE|1.0|Horrible app I saved everything on it and I went into the app 2 days later and everything I wrote wasn't there and now I have no way of remembering what it was, wish I never got it
B005GRTNVE|5.0|I JUST LOVE  IL DIVO--I HAVE MOST OF THEIR MUSIC. WISH I COULD AFFORD TO GO AND SEE THEM PERFORM
B0083Z614S|5.0|I thought this book would be boring when I first started reading it, but boy was I wrong!!!!!!! This book is packed with emotion, and surprise!!!!! It sure as heck isn't predictable!!!!!!! I love this book, and you will too!!!!!
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|this is a amazing movie. this is one of my favorite movies of last year. great tribute to class horror movies
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I liked the book.  Just sucks cause I wanted have n Cleary to be together..but no. Overall it was good
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Very addicting! After finding some time off, I started playing this app and hours quickly flew by. I downloaded for the whole family and we are working at beating each others scores.
B007HACDLK|5.0|One can only hope there are real men and women out there like Rapp and Kennedy working in the dark to keep us safe.<br /><br />Flynn's obviously done his homework, as the narrative and dialogue are realistic and enjoyable to read. Didn't expect the plot twist, where a good guy goes bad, but should have as Flynn always keeps the reader on his or her toes waiting to see how the story unfolds. With the world, mainly the Afghan region, being what it is, it makes me wonder how much of this stuff goes on without anyone ever knowing about it. Scary.<br /><br />Sad that Hurley is on his way out, but maybe he'll be the central part of Flynn's next novel. I'm sure there's plenty a story behind that character.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this game as the boards are quite challenging and passes the time<br />pretty quickly. After completing the first round, you can complete the game again at a more challenging level. If you like Bejeweled, you will enjoy this game.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|I like the action and the progress of this book. There's a lot I could say about this book and I could go on forever by  I would recommend this book to anyone any day. I have also read the maze runner the scorch trials so that also made this series amazing... Now it's time to start reading the kill order...
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|Very simple and entertaining.  Hard to stop playing, and the layout of the app works great on the Nexus 7.

B0081KTI0E|4.0|Liked this movie until the end.  The end has a twist that you can like or not like.  Over all it is scary which was worth the money
B0006GAOCW|5.0|You have to write too much. I did not personally watch this DVD but my daughter did and she loves it.
B00APUYWYA|1.0|I love music and enjoy a good laugh and for that reason give this one star,just awful.Who are these people? And the 'lead' male had way too much confidence for such a doofus,he looked like one of the first victims in a Friday the 13th movie.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I play this game everyday..  the only complaint I have is I feel like most the games aren't winable. you probably win about 4 of every 10 games.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|A Christmas classic with high sentimental value. As always, wading through Dickens prose is no easy task. But it is worth the effort
1451648537|5.0|my son , an advertising artist is a big Apple fan, as are his children.  So this was a very enjoyable birthday gift for him.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I first became acquainted with Gary Taubes through a New York Times article explaining why sugar may be killing us all. After reading that fascinating and well researched piece, I discovered this book.<br />Taubes lays out the case for low carb weight loss with the skilled hand of an experienced science writer. He presents ample evidence for his propositions and cites the research of experts past and present. Occasionally, the technical and scientific content is heavy, but Taubes presents it in a manner digestible by laypersons.<br />Taubes also explains how the medical community adopted the false notions that dietary fat causes heart disease and that weight gain is driven by calorie consumption.<br />This is not a diet book, but a comprehensive explanation of why the standard low calorie diet does not work. However, if you are looking for a diet, an appendix includes a plan developed by Duke University.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who has struggled with weight loss and wants to understand why.
B00002N9ER|5.0|These are well made and come with everything you need.<br />I ended up using the two clips to mount two different flash lights. Each of the two  mounts are holding a 4 cell Maglite.<br /><br />I want to buy another set and mount all my Maglite's
B004J4WLPU|4.0|Loved the premise, loved the writing.  Not wild about the ending and that was the consensus of the book group too.
B007HACDLK|5.0|If you are a current Vince Flynn fan, you will not be disappointed. If you are not a current fan, you have no idea what you are missing.  He just keeps getting better and better.
B001D09OAI|4.0|My wife doesn't understand why anyone would want to watch a movie twice let alone multiple times.  I ask her how she can listen to a song or album over and over again.  She says that's a false comparison.  Perhaps it is... all I know is this is a movie that I have to watch at least a couple times a year.  My highest rating for a movie is the fact that I own it.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I liked this book because there was just as much action as there was Romance.  It was easy to imagine this being a true story
B003O86FMW|4.0|Awesome book can't wait for the trilogy I'm starting it I immediately. What an awesome series I recommend everyone read it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I believe<br />everyone should get this app no crashes or anything as I said love it becausevit gives u something to do very adictive
0399226907|5.0|ordered this book and a small caterpiller to go woth this book to use in my class room<br />wonderful prices for a teachers budget trying to stock her class romm<br />books were like new
B0067QPVD2|1.0|Let me start by saying how much I loved the original thing, John Carpenter's masterpiece is one of the top horror films up to date. And when I heard they were \\"remaking\\" it, I just had to see it.<br /><br />Story: It turns out this film is actually not a remake, but a premake! You''ll noticed this at the end of the film, but was a premake even neccesary? The whole point was that we didn't know what was going on, we didn't need answers, that's what made the original scary. If you ask me this film is just a remake in disguise, most of the events that occurred in the film were the same as the original. The spaceship scene? Don't even get me started with how absurd that was, that was just going too far. Basically they are all stuck together in the artic and are trying to figure out who the next thing is. Personally this film to me would've been better off as a remake.<br /><br />Acting: The acting was great, I actually had no problem with it. And they didn't choose well known actors, they chose some fresh new meat!<br /><br />Special effects/CGI: This may be the worst CGI work I have ever seen in my life! It looked like something off the syfy channel. Example, in the beginning during the helicopter scene, when the guy's head split open, it looked like something off photoshop, no, worse! The original film contained anamatronic pupptery, no CGI. Now I don't have a problem with CGI, but at least make it look good. I was not scared a single bit, this was the biggest dealbreaker for me.<br /><br />Final word: Please do not waste your hard earned cash on this, if you want a real scary film, see the original, this film just doesn't do justice to it.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|my son wanted this ,movie to complete the 4 Karate kids movies set<br />price was great<br />movie is like new<br />seller is wonderful
B00003CXTG|1.0|Pearl harbor the movie is an embarrassment to our grandparents. This film was clearly about the money and effects. If you are trying to learn history, do not watch this film, it's inaccurate in every way. My 8th grade teacher actually showed us this film, no joke. If I were you, I would watch TORA TORA TORA! Does more justice to WW2.<br /><br />Story: An ugly mess, I'll give you some inaccurate events. Due to the obvious difficulties in obtaining antique machinery, some of the military equipment does not exactly match the period, and dates from later in the war. Some of the ships and aircraft were built long after World War II, or have equipment added by their present owners - antique planes and warships are even harder to come by.<br />-Air conditioning units can be seen on top of the White House.<br />-Evelyn and her nurse friends are shown wearing bikinis. The bikini didn't make its first appearance until 1946.<br />-The Japanese zero aircraft depicted in the film are green, even though the ones used in the real attack in 1941 were painted grey. The Japanese Navy didn't paint their zeroes green until 1943.<br />-In the beginning of the movie, we see a newsreel of 1940, showing a US tank fighting in the city of Cologne. This did not happen before March 1945.<br />-After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Danny and Rafe are seen boarding a C-47 transport which is to take them to their destination where they will train for the top secret mission. The C-47 used, clearly has a radar dome mounted in the nose. C-47s of this type did not exist in that time frame.<br />-When Rafe and the other pilots are attempting to reach their planes, he tells them that P-40s can't outrun Zeroes, but can out-turn them. Not only is this information untrue, in fact the truth is quite the opposite, but how would he know this information? The Zero was only introduced in 1940, and very few, if any, Americans had ever seen it in action before Pearl Harbor.<br />-The \\"Battle of Britain\\" scenes take place in early 1941, but the battle ended by the end of October 1940. The Germans still bombed the UK until 1941 but only at night<br />-At that time, Japanese was written from right to left. All the Japanese characters in the movie are written from left to right, except one phrase, which says, \\"Empire of Japan banzai\\".<br />-Rafe explains to the pilots, that are going to fight the Zeros that are strafing the airfield, that \\"P-40's can't outrun Zeros, so we're going to have to out-fly them.\\" He has the aircraft capabilities backwards. In level flight and especially a dive, the P-40 can outrun a Zero any day. On the same note, a Zero can fly circles around a P-40. Pilots fighting the Zero in the P-40 were told to use \\"zoom and boom\\" tactics, diving on Zeros and racing away. If a P-40 pilot ever tried to out-fly a Zeros superior maneuverability, he'd be dead.<br />-In the scene where President Roosevelt is expressing his dismay with the Americans not doing more to aid the Aliies in Europe he mentions that the US needs to send more tanks to Britain and Russia, to provide aid. At this point in time, early 1941, Russia was still an ally of Nazi Germany. They didn't start fighting on the side of the Allies until after the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 and were not considered part of the Allies until January 1942.<br /><br />Those are just some inaccurate events, as for the usless story, It's a Sunday morning on December 7, 1941. After being presumed dead during the Battle of Britain, Capt. Rafe McCawley struggle in his relationship with Nurse Lt. Evelyn Johnson, as well as his best friend, Capt. Danny Walker, who is also taking a shine towards Evelyn. Whilst this is going on, Japan are planning a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. This would've been interesting, if they had left out, or at least toned down the love story.<br /><br />Acting: This may be some of the worst acting I have ever seen, Ben Afflect's fake accent was so bad, I don't even know what accenthe was attempting. Kate Beckinsale at least tried, she should have known better though before taking this role. Of course there were couples at the time, but they didn't have to drag out the romance, I want to hear more about the history.<br /><br />Special effects/CGI: The CGI was great, and that's about all you get, they spent all their money on the attack scene when they should've been spending more money on the historians.<br /><br />Michael Bay: You need to stick with horror remakes, because your original films are awful. Stephen Speilberg should have directed this.<br /><br />Final Word: A complete waste of time, it's all about the money. If you want to see a better historical film, watch World Trade Center, not this crud. To all you history lovers out there, including me, you must know this film is inaccurate in every way. This is a type of film that should be remade, with better writing, and directing. If my grandfather had saw this, (sigh). Disgrace!he was attempting. Kate Beckinsale at least tried, she should have known better though before taking this role.

B009JZVT70|5.0|I love this series...I watch this show with my 9 year old son and we both enjoy it very much!!
B008B3EQPI|5.0|One of the best albums I've heard in years. They blend a variety of instruments and styles together seamlessly to create a genre-defying masterpiece. I particularly have to applaud their use of dubstep in &#34;Justice for Saint Mary&#34;--I never thought I would like dubstep, but they applied it masterfully.
B008MM9630|5.0|Awesome game with great graphics. Plenty of goals with rewards. Does not require Internet in order to play. One of my favorite games.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book, what can I say? IT'S AMAZING!!! August is so amazing and I can't even explain how I feel! Bravo
B006RXQDH8|4.0|Shock and Blood, lots of action (samurai sword fighting featured heavily), Good sense of humor, entertaining so long as you are not put off by blood squirting severed limbs and or heads....I'm ready to watch Volume 2. A good look at Tarrentino's earlier work for comparison with his later movies such as Pulp Fiction, Inglorious Bastards and Djengo.....At the very least, you are never bored!
B0077ATSSQ|2.0|Plot: When Oskar's dad passes away in the 9/11 terrorest attack, oskar finds a key in his dad's closet and he sets out on a journey to find out what the key fits and is acompanyed by a mute old guy.<br /><br />My Oppinoin: The story is good but the movie is slow and boring and Oskar is annoying. this is just a horrible movie. tom hanks was the only actor outside sandra bullock that caught my attention. but all in all this movie is boring. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you don't
B0094BB4TW|2.0|whenever i open a picture, it takes about 10 attempts at hitting the back arrow button to finally close out of the picture. this is something that started recently, it wasn't always unresponsive like this
B00884GR0W|5.0|OMG I LUV THIS GAME!!! I got it and I have been playing it for hours! People say it's &quot;Like Minecraft&quot; or &quot;Sucks and has less stuff than Minecraft.&quot; Well it doesn't.<br /><br />Like for instance, if you can see the animals are NOT blocked. They are detailed figures that are represented in the game, AND that there are inhabited people around the game. They aren't blocked either.<br /><br />ALSO for once I ACTUALLY see  that there are more blocks. Coral reefs, forgotten stone, and even sources for the unknown and yet to be discovered. Like of you dig down and down and down, you can see Hell without a portal,and Heaven without a mod. More and yet to come in this game! I am excited for new things that will make this game more interesting! I used to play Minecraft before  Block Story. Good thing I don't play that rubbish anymore. This game looks great on my kindle fire! It shows my internal artist and architect.
B002LATN9G|4.0|This is exactaly what I thought this movie would be about. It helps that it has very attractive men fighting in a ring
B006X5L6VS|1.0|I thought it was supposed to show the stars in the sky, supposedly all I had to do was point the tablet skyward.  Not true, you have to move the skylie with your finger, not what I thought at all.
B004HO6I2E|5.0|This movie is exactly what you would expect it to be. It is great and funny how could it be bad
1440503257|5.0|I got this for my friend for Christmas, and she LOVES it! She loves to cook and she loves Harry Potter. There are so many recipes! I just might have to get one for myself!

B00076RT24|2.0|You just have to look over to see the carnage of the auto wreck, don't you.  We've all seen this hoax of a Star Wars movie so no need to add more. This time my 5 year old wanted to watch and I think he liked about 15 minutes of it total. Puke.
032180354X|5.0|There's nothing new in this book, but the info is solid.  I'd recommend for someone just getting into off camera flash.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was weary of reading this.  Well worth my Time I am on to the next one now :) amazing
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This game is SO CUTE!!!!  I mean all these games that zepto lab has made are so awesome.  I know what would be awesome pudding monsters and cut the rope put together. Now that would be awesome.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I do love this app but I only wish it had glow in the dark feature versus the dimming feature. It does have alarm clock and timer which is very useful. I wish it gave u the option to customize it but overall it is a great app.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|Decent concept but it dosent really make sense. Why can't they get rid of the bodies in the future, seems like if time travel is possible you should be able to get rid of a body.
B00A757EFW|5.0|is great classic game ,graphics and speed of the game are great never get tired of playing it! kids love it
B0084I9QIW|5.0|Like others I've been waiting years and years and years for this to be released. MJ is spectacular in this. His singing and dancing the best in the world. His energy is off the charts, and he seems so happy. It just amazing and brilliant. The video quality sucks, but even still you can so appreciate MJ's magnificence.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|Grandkids and i loved it. We had to give our first copy to an autistic  child so we needed to replace it.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|My kids loved it. But my nine yr old made $18 worth purchases. I assumed if I have a password that shouldn't happen. There is no where I can find in the game to set a password to block kids from buying stuff. I think it is crappy of Amazon to sell this kind of game that doesn't allow the kindle to block purchases! I am deleting it!! Do NOT BUY it if you have kids!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|No prior experience with sharpeners. It works well with blades of good material. Tried it on one with s***ty steel: 7-8 pulls, and nothing. Then with one of good steel: 3-4 pulls, and the blade is cutting again like new. Good to have this kinds of things in a household.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|show is awesome. but what i prefer with amazon instant video over itunes is that i dont have to download it to my computer and waste precious space. all i need is an internet connection and i can stream it in HD.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|good funny movie.love all men in black movies.too bad im a bad typist i would write a better review.done.wish  i never did this now
B000FC10WU|4.0|This is a fun way to spend an evening--trying to guess the murderer before Miss Marble reveals it.  If you read carefully, you can do it because the clues are there. I like downloading Agatha Christie's novels and stories on my Kindle because I can get a good story at a cheap price.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|While most of kings novels have thoughtful, some times provocative over tones. This novel, though, is just a helluva lot of fun.<br />Jake Epping had not yet been born when JFK was slain in Dallas, but he remains persistent to change the past, possibly also to save his GED student's family. He's no the most compelling of kings main characters, but he's a decent enough narrator who is carried by a fast pace, gripping story of time travel.
1439190275|3.0|The book has good ideas that make sense. I lost about 10 pounds. I really should go back to it.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|Like it because it is the best thing I have ever read in my life so that why I like this one book
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Tons of fun and way too addictive! I have 2 reasons it's not a 5 star game 1) it has a requirement for social media interactions in order to complete some of the quests and I feel pretty silly spamming my Facebook friends with requests and 2) the &quot;optional&quot; real money purchases of gems through Amazon are not so optional if you want to make progress measured in hours or days not months! It would probably take years of game time to earn some of the cooler ponies without throwing a few bucks away on gems every now and then. Otherwise, it's super fun, the graphics are great, and my kids (ages 4 and 2) love it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone who is into the Hunger Games series. I didn't expect (spoiler alert ) that District 13 isn't gone. I can't wait to read Mockingjay. I recommend that this book is read by people in Reading Classics. Suzanne Collins is an excellent author. GOOD JOB SUZANNE COLLINS!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book its the best one ive ever read. Its the beat and i know it is such a good ending
B0071XO8RA|5.0|All I can say is WOW! I bought the omnibus after I read, and was thoroughly impressed by, the free first installment. I'm always wary of ebooks because you can't really judge the quality of them before you buy (even if you can download a free chapter), so it was a great idea on the author's part to release the first installment for free. The quality of the writing is AMAZING throughout the entire collection. The second part is a little slow, but necessarily so because it sets up the turning point for the rest of the story. I was heartbroken when I got to the end. If the author decided to serialize the story, I would faithfully buy every installment. It's just that good. I've already bought the first prequel and I'm pretty confident it will be just as awesome as the Wool series.<br /><br />This is what self publishing should be about: someone with immense talent, who otherwise would have their manuscripts in a huge pile on some overworked editor's desk, can bring their work to the readers directly and (hopefully) make some really good money doing it. I really hope Mr. Howey's career can rival that of Orson Scott Card, Dean Koontz or even Stephen King--his writing and storytelling abilities are truly top-notch and he deserves million dollar paychecks for his talents. Plus his \\"Q&A\\" session literally made me LOL, and that's a hard thing to accomplish. Now, on to the next story!

0316228532|1.0|A very dark and depressing view of our society.  There were too many characters introduced too quickly; I was half way through the book before I could keep them straight.  I frequently put the book down for days at a time, and continued to read it, not with interest in the story, but with a desire to finish it so I could read something else. I do not recommend it.

0393316041|4.0|This is a collection of anecdotes written in the first person. Some of them are charming and amusing but there is little to learn and Feynman was not James Bond after all so you should not expect too much. I would have given the book 3 stars had it not been for the last essay on 'cargo cult science' where Feynman describes some of the characteristics of good and bad science, namely the need for complete integrity and honesty in proper science. But you can find that essay on the internet as well.
030758836X|3.0|This one started out as a love story and developed into a mystery.  Amy and Nick had a story book relationship until Nick loses his job at a magazine (the result of the preference of the Internet over the written word) and then Amy loses her job (although she has a substantial trust fund to fall back on).  With an ailing mother and father, Nick decides to return from NYC to his hometown in Missouri.  The relationship begins to falter in NYC but worsens in Missouri where Amy feels not only out of her element but feels to be the victim of the widening gulf in their relationship.  The story is told in first person by Nick and via diary entries by Amy through the first part of the book.  Part Two of the book takes a turn (I have to say I kind of saw the unexpected twist coming).  The biggest issue I had with this book was that although both characters seemed to be the kind of people everyone would like, ultimately neither had the kind of personalities that would endear them to anyone.  As a result, I stopped caring as to what would happen to either of them as much as I was curious to see where the book would lead.  The only character that I actually started to care about was Margo (Nick's twin sister) who helplessly looked on while trying to support her brother as the mystery unfolded.  I have to think the author wanted to create two characters that were so real that they had the flaws that were depicted.  The ending (some say it was unexpected) was somewhat unfullfilling but it leaves open a possible sequel to see what the future might be.

B007Y36K46|3.0|I sort of like this movie, and yet I don't like it and I wish I did. I guess I just feel ambiguous about it. I can appreciate it intellectually, but I can't FEEL for it.<br /><br />It is a conundrum, wrapped in an enigma, with a mystery.<br /><br />The conundrum is why don't I feel more about this film... why didn't it move me as it should have?<br /><br />The enigma is why Disney produced it under their name (instead of Touchstone or another of their properties) -- implying this is a type of \\"kids\\" movie or family entertainment (which it isn't), and why did it fail in the Box Office and among critics and so many film goers?<br /><br />The mystery is how all the amazing talent that went into this fell so flat on screen.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Very Lavish Production - sets and scenery are excellent, CGI work top notch and seamless.<br /><br />Good Actors - convincing us that they are the characters they portray.<br /><br />Fast Paced Action - plenty of action scenes - in fact these are what help hold the movie together.<br /><br />Relatively Faithful to the Source - based on the ERB \\"Princess of Mars\\" and other John Carter series of books. Follows the basic plot of POM with some elements from later books thrown in.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Lavish Production is Eye Candy - While the sets are excellent, we get no reason WHY they are what they are. We see everything in very fast cut scenes (including the characters) as if the camera is afraid to linger on a scene long enough for our eyes to focus.<br /><br />Little or No Character (and possibly actor) Chemistry - It didn't seem like the characters really cared for or about each other. Carter and the Princess are at odds only because they have different goals. We don't know what they FEEL about each other or much of anything else. Tars Tarkas is interested in John Carter because he can jump? Huh? There's got to be more. Okay Tars is a CGI character but other films have paired CGI with live characters with a lot more chemistry.<br /><br />Fast Paced Action Too Fast - The camera never stops to linger on anything, it just keeps moving around so we don't see anything in detail or depth. We see lot's of battle scenes with hand to hand combat in what is supposed to be an advanced civilization. Huh? The Tharks have guns, but the people of Helium and Zodanga have swords? Why?<br /><br />Relatively Faithful to the Source - ERB wrote the John Carter series starting as a novel that was later turned into a magazine serial. It was designed to keep readers buying the magazine to read the next installment. In this genre, character is weak and adventure and suspense are high. That's what the audience expects for this type of literature.  The movie seems to follow that approach, which makes it a bit of an empty film. It didn't translate to screen well and lost what made the books appealing. How did they manage this?<br /><br />Pointless Back Story - Why did they put in the back story about ERB as a real person being the nephew of a real life John Carter? It wasn't necessary! The novel explains why JC goes to Mars and comes back several times, perfectly well. The movie could have eliminated the back story, been shorter and less confusing if it simply followed the book better. Having someone appear as ERB in the movie didn't add credibility for me, it seemed to be a cheap attempt at getting credibility -- as if the producers knew the movie wasn't going to fly on its own.<br /><br />------------------------<br /><br />Overall, the movie has all the parts of a good well crafted film, but they didn't hold together for me. I didn't feel any sympathy for John Carter until well into the film when we are FINALLY shown why he is so empty headed - that he lost his wife and child in some sort of attack by someone or other who burn down his house while he is away doing something or other. Action without reason leads to a cognitive disconnect. If this part of the movie (it wasn't in the books) was closerto the beginning (in fact, it could have replaced the back story) we'd have some sympathy for the character from the outset. Instead, Carter comes off as obnoxious for no apparent reason other than he is an idiot. People generally do have motivations for being who they are. The film should have gotten this underway a lot sooner.<br /><br />John and the Princess Dejah Thoris are at odds with each other throughout most of the film. They have different goals. Carter wants to get back to Earth, Thoris wants to save her city of Helium from being overtaken by Zodanga. This was never in the original book, but it could work today as a motivation. Thoris misses what should have been obvious, that she has to motivate Carter into coming to her aid (apparently because he can jump over tall buildings... not sure why this is a great advantage). If the film had developed her character into more of this type of leadership, she could have helped Carter go through a necessary catharsis (i.e. recover a motivation for living a full life) about his family loss and develop as a character. She could have been more passionate about her Helium and her hatred of Zodanga. We just don't get much of anything. It's not the actor at fault here, the script doesn't have the content for her to work with.<br /><br />We are looking at an alien world with fascinating looking beings and an alien culture. ERB did give them good descriptions and it appears that the movie follows that. But ERB also gave the Tharks and others a sense of motivation. They had a reason for their wanderings in the Martian desert (to gather their young hatchlings - which gets done in a few minutes towards the start of the film). Tars Tarkis is a leader among his people in the book, and there, we understand why. In the book, Carter learns about the Tharks, how they live, and why they do what they do. There is chemistry. Unfortunately in this movie, we just see THAT they exist without any reason other than to fight among themselves and get caught up in the war between Helium and Zodanga.<br /><br />Admittedly, the novel wasn't \\"deep\\", and was mostly about fighting among the peoples of the planet. That was in 1911. We have advanced somewhat since then, and the movie could have added some substance to the story. They tried with the introduction of the mysterious manipulators/villains the Thern, but I think it was the wrong way to go. They just are annoying meddlers. They could have been much more interesting, if they had a reason for being in the movie. But like all the characters, they are there, with no real reason.<br /><br />I found myself thinking of the very first Star Wars. It's not good when one movie makes you think of another! But all that made Star Wars good seems to have fallen flat in John Carter.<br /><br />In SW, we have the character of R2D2. He looks like a vacuum cleaner, has no comprehensible dialog, yet he becomes one of the most endearing characters in the series. In Carter we have the Woola, a dog-like thing which basically serves a similar cinematic purpose. Only it doesn't quite work. There is no interaction between the Woola and Cater to explain the animal's devotion to him.<br /><br />In SW we got Chewbacca the Wookie. He's large, furry, makes no linguistic sense (he can't speak words) but we love him because of himself. In Carter we have Tars Tarkas. He's large, green and he CAN make linguistic sense, but who cares? We never get any chemistry from him, any message, any motivation, and he was voiced by one of the best actors in Hollywood, Willem Dafoe. What the heck happened?<br /><br />In SW we have a Princess, Leia, who is trying to save her world. She's annoying perhaps, but spunky and feisty and we really like her. In Carter, we have Thoris, also a Princess, but she has no spunk, no energy and who really cares? She's beautiful (much more than Leia) and seems to be eye candy more than character.<br /><br />It is probably unfair to compare Carter with Star Wars - but it begs the question... what did Lukas do right, that the folks at Disney missed? And HOW did they miss it? Lukas had to invent the entire Star Wars Universe. Disney had it handed to them on a platter by ERB and somehow they still missed the boat!<br /><br />The John Cater books were highly successful and lasting. People still read and enjoy them today more than 100 years after they first appeared. The source material has a loyal audience. HOW did this movie lose out on all that?<br /><br />---------------------<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />John Carter as a film is worth a look simply because it is the first attempt to capture the ERB JC Mars novels on screen.<br /><br />It has a good look, but not much else.<br /><br />So I'd suggest a cheap rental (like for $3.99 which Amazon isn't currently offering) because it helps you spend 2 hours wondering - what was Disney thinking?<br /><br />I can't say I liked the movie, I can't say I didn't like the movie.<br /><br />All I can do is ask, how did it fall so flat when they had ALL the pieces to make a really great film?<br /><br />Mildly entertaining, but nothing to get excited over.<br /><br />Sorry Disney. You've done such good films in the past.<br /><br />Pity this one came off as such a dud.es and get caught up in the war between Helium and Zodanga.<br /><br />Admittedly, the novel wasn't \\"deep\\", and was mostly about fighting among the peoples of the planet.

B008YWY0HK|5.0|I just love this story and the quality of the animation.  We are starting to slow down on how many dvds we get so, we are getting pickier about which ones we buy.  This is such a good movie.  My 10 year old son also loves the movie.
B000002KHH|5.0|The only reason I purchased this CD was for the 'IronMan' song.  itunes does not have the studio version only the live one so I got the CD from Amazon.  This WHOLE CD is awesome.  Back in high school when the 'metal heads' wore Sabbath tee shirts I never understood how great the band is.  LOVE this album!
B003NFM3JK|5.0|(A Note to parents:  This movie is rated PG for scary images.  The images are not gratuitous or 'above and beyond' the story line.  My 10 yr old watched it without any trouble.  You know your kid, I recommend previewing if you have any doubts, or check out the parent review on IMDb. They do a great job outlining movies specifically for parents.)<br />What do you get when you put Jim Carey, Gary Oldman and  Colin Firth in a Robert Zemechis  movie?  A great movie!  This classic story has been updated with  Zemechis' animation technique while staying true to the story.  There are some rather dark elements that I think Dickens himself would approve of.  Carey and Oldman deliver their multiple characters beautifully.  I find it ironic that Carey, who usually plays a character that makes us laugh (Mask) plays Scrooge and the 3 Ghosts, while Oldman, who usually plays the bad guy (Sirius Black, Sid Viscous, Dracula..to name a few of his brilliantly delivered bad guys..) plays Tiiny Tim, Bob Cratchet and Jacob Marley (we couldn't have all these crazy characters without giving Oldman one bad guy, could we?)  There are some scenes at are a bit darker that we are used to.  I think Zemechis had the courage to show the story as the dark story that it really is instead of trying to 'pretty it up' as has been done with previous versions.  My 10 year old son has watched it without any trouble.  If you have a child that is sensitive to dark images, you might want to preview it first...then decide.
B00AIQP9DE|2.0|I was really enjoying this game until I got to the point where you are supposed to get the first teeth plate.  It is in the cabinet in the manager's office, and it is supposed to be unlocked.  But it's not, and there is no clue or hint as to finding a key for it.  I cannot open the cabinet.<br /><br />Too bad too.  I was really enjoying playing.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I enjoyed this book by Tom Clancy because it was current.  Make me wonder if Tom<br />had some inside information of the working of the IT world.  Very scarry.  Made me think that one<br />should make plans to change their lifestyle.  Lots of characters which took a while to build in the beginning of the book,<br />but the the action came fast and furious from then.
B009E3EY38|5.0|This is the best concert movie ever! Led Zeppelin sounds as good as they ever have and the way the movie was edited you get to see how they make the music. I down loaded the CDs to my iPod and listen to the songs all the time now. This set has made me fall in love will over again with LZ!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Even if you're not a fan of the Crystal Skull this set is perfect for any Indiana Jones fan. The classics have been remastered and there are tons of bonus features.
B00AEFVRB2|2.0|Good cast but storyline made no sense and left to many ends incomplete. My favorite part however was as the very last scene was ending they began to play Clarence Carters &#34;strokin&#34;! Great tune, and I found that song was the Hi-point of the whole film to me!
B0047SF41G|3.0|I kind of had my reservations about this movie but it was better than I expected it to be.  It's an okay movie if you were into the first one.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Great array of characters and the timeline was a very interesting time in our history. Very believable story and acting was done quite well. Glad I saw it but I can't see me renting it again.
B004UNX1LS|4.0|I like that you have all the official music video (much better then other sights where it says offical and turns out to be a remix or not the video)  I wish the video was better quality on my Kindle Fire  but it's not an HD so whatever you still see the video.  Good to catch up with artists
1451629184|5.0|Love the book. Great story, Very touching. I will support this young lady however I can. She is my hero!
B00A3K2PZA|5.0|As you will see on the reviews posted here, you will either love this movie or hate it.  My wife & I thought it was one of the best movies we have seen.<br /><br />For all those that say this movie is violent, disgusting, over the top & stereotyping trailer trash, you are correct.  But, it is for all those attributes, and the unbelievably superb acting by the entire cast that makes this a must-see movie!
B004EPYZUI|5.0|I purchased this movie because I missed it while it was in the Theater. Emily Browning (lead role) is put in a unbearable situation and with four fellow prisoners must escape a prison using dreams and imagination. There is a lot of action and unexpected twists. A very entertaining movie.
B0027MJU00|3.0|I read this book first before reading the more well known &#34;Gone Girl.&#34; to get a sense of the author. Well, I have a sense of her now.  This is a  surprising read because all the way through it, I held out hope that just ONE of these characters would offer some redeeming quality that would make me like them.  It didn't happen while I read the book;however, oddly enough days after finishing, I found myself still thinking about the characters and their predicaments.  It took a while, but I finally put them all to rest and found a bit of the &#34;hope&#34; for them that I had been wanting.  It wasn't easy!  This is a flat-out tough book to read.  The title isn't just descriptive....the book is &#34;dark.&#34; The author is truly talented both as a writer and a psychologist! I would recommend this book to my reading friends, but only those I know who can handle it.  If you want &#34;fluff&#34;, don't bother, but if you want those moments of &#34;I can't take my eyes off the wreck happening right in front of me!&#34;, then read this.It's not for everybody, but it's a remarkably created piece of work.  It's a journey!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|OOOOH, I can't wait for the third book to come out! I have read all of his books! Such a great writer!
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Don't expect too much from this raunchy comedy besides laughter.  But come on, there's a goddamn teddy bear that comes to life and smokes weed so, what more could you expect.

B000NGTJTY|4.0|I know its years since this movie came out but I was never in love with the thought of sitting through Leonardo Dicaprio and Matt Damon in a movie together.  All I can say is I was wrong and that was proved to me once I was finally forced to watch this movie.

I don't believe that everybody gets to keep their eyes or not get sick or whatever, but everybody should have true love, and it should last at least as long as your life does.\\"<br /><br />How to start my review on this particular novel? As some of you may have known, I'm a medical student and a licensed nurse, and despite the fact, I never really pursued my nursing career because I've entered medical school as soon as I got my degree it's still a bit hard to comment on a novel based on a disease, I have been studying and is studying at the moment. That's why I won't really put my review on the technicalities of cancer and it's development and all those geeky stuff but instead I would focus on the story in itself since this is a book review.<br /><br />To tell you the truth, I've never really read anything made by John Green, until this one. What got me interested in it is because I kept on seeing it on our local bookstore as the number one book to read. And that got me, wanting to actually read this particular novel despite the fact that I'm very busy these past few days with my school works. As I have told you before, I usually read novels during boring lectures and that's what exactly I've done with this one.<br /><br />And reading only a bit of it, I was instantly hooked. I felt that the love presented in the book is perfect and yet you can't help but feel a bit unfair. It makes you question a lot of things. Embarrassingly enough, I stopped reading until I got home because I was trying to stop myself from crying during class and despite wanting to continue on reading I stopped and went home and at the confines of my room enter the world of Hazel and Gus.<br /><br />The main protagonist, Hazel Grace, in my opinion, is so well made (not in a sense of being Mary Sue-ish). I said that because she not your typical heroine, who is so pretty and so positive and so strong (although I think she is) and all those superlatives that you can think of. She's just Hazel Grace, a surprising survivor of a stage 4-thyroid cancer, who according to her mother needs to socialize more and be a teenager like she is and not bury herself on reading this one book (that in my opinion became a very important standing ground of the story). For me, she's someone who is trying to be sarcastic in order to make her feel strong, in a way. And I feel like her falling in love was never really in her mind because she have already set her mind that in anytime her medications or therapy might fail and she does not want to leave to many people to be hurt when she's gone. I can't really tell much about her because I felt that no matter what I say I can't perfectly explain who Hazel Grace is and actually that's how I really felt about her.<br /><br />While, her other half in the story, is Augustus Waters. Augustus is also a cancer survivor, and he is portrayed as a handsome young man with one fake leg for he lost it during his fight with cancer. I totally adore Augustus to tell you the truth. He's also not your perfect guy next door to swoon at but for me he's just perfect. I love the way he would try to find sarcasm in depressing times. And the way he would call Hazel as Hazel Grace made me feel all giggly and happy inside. The way he fell in love with Hazel is so beautifully made despite my aversion to instant love at first sight kind-of-thing. I'm not sure but they just work. His wittiness and carelessness and all the things that made him Gus felt right for me even his faults.<br /><br />The last thing I'll talk about is the romance side of the story and after that I'll end this review because I really don't want to say more due to the fact that I want you to read this particular book.<br /><br />So, the romance part and I'll start my review on that part with this one thought; it's like a fairytale with a finished yet unfinished happy ending. Kind of confusing right? But that's what I felt because the way the fell in love with each other is like a fairytale in itself. I'm not being mean or something but it's hard to fall in love when you are thinking to many things and it's especially hard to get in a relationship if you know that you're entering something that maybe one of you may die in an instant. That's actually Hazel's dilemma. She doesn't want to enter a relationship because for her she's like a bomb that is constantly ticking and suddenly she would explode leaving everyone around her hurt. While, Gus believes that they should live in the moment and once you fall in love you can't stop yourself. You can't order yourself to stop. And the author showed this in a real warm and very subtle way, in a way, he presented their love story in a heart fluttering and at the same time a heart wrenching way. And I would like to quote another one from this book because I felt this part explained everything about their relationship;<br /><br />\\"There are infinite numbers between 0 and 1. There's .1 and .12 and .112 and an infinite collection of others. Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between 0 and 2, or between 0 and a million. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. A writer we used to like taught us that. There are days, many of them, when I resent the size of my unbounded set. I want more numbers than I'm likely to get, and God, I want more numbers for Augustus Waters than he got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity. I wouldn't trade it for the world. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and I'm grateful.\\"<br /><br />Well, this is my review for the Fault in our Stars and hope you would have time to actually read this. Because;<br /><br />\\"Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book.\\"<br /><br />―John Green, The Fault in Our Starsith each other is like a fairytale in itself.

B000FC2L1Y|5.0|You had me at, \\"Oh, aye...\\" This installment was very nearly as good as the first one. Outlander was my favorite so far but this one is taking a very close second. I laughed, I cried, I held my breath. And I actually mourned the end. I was more than a little depressed on the day I woke up and didn't have this book to fill my time! I'm trying to ration the three remaining books in the series but I'm anxious to get back to the rowdy Frasers.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book has a great romantic story line and if you liked fifty shades of gray you will enjoy this book as well!!!
0385335997|5.0|I am more in love with James and Claire every time I devour one of the books in this series. I have been rationing them out to myself in order to make the magic last longer. I've been listening to these because the reader, Davina Porter, absolutely brings these characters to life for me. I become so engrossed that I can't do anything but listen. I am plugged in constantly until the final page is read. On to number four and already dreading the final number seven...
B005RYF5JA|5.0|ANOTHER GREAT PRODUCTION FROM SOME OF THE WORLDS GREATEST ARTISTS!!!---THE VOICE OF CHLOE IS MAGNIFICENT!!  WOULD RECOMEND &#34;BELIEVE LIVE&#34; TO ALL MUSIC LOVERS.
0553584537|2.0|This quick read didn't capture my interest. The plot elements were all there: suspense, scary twist, thriller ending, unanticipated motives but at the end I still went, \\"Uh... okay.\\" Gardner wasn't able to weave my interest into her story. I love a good thriller to shake up my reading list but I won't be looking for any more of hers.
B004XQO90O|5.0|This movie is great! Jake Gyllenhaal stars in a science fiction thriller about quantum physics. The packaging was great and it arrived in only one day through standard shipping! The bonus features on this disc are amazing and include over 5 interviews with cast and crew and, mini-movies explaining focal points of the plot!
0812548094|3.0|I'm only mildly attached to this series. I'm enjoying it but I wouldn't miss it if I never read any further than this one. Finally in Stone of Tears I began to develop an attachment to some of the characters. Without that attachment, I have a difficult time engrossing myself in the tale. My hope is that I enjoy each additional one a little more than the last. I would love to love this long series.
B00899DR40|5.0|Amazeballs cd.  Love it. All of the songs put me in such a good mood! And Amazon digital download is so easy to use and much better pricing!
B00846REIS|5.0|The two Crossfire books are very fast passed. To see how two people meet by chance and everything changes. Although Eve has money and her Mother and Step Father have money, Eve is very grounded.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|We have had so much fun with this it is easy to use and we actually made a bunch of rum glasses for a locale bar, they loved the finished product. It does take time and patience!
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This movie is definitely...a must see. Randy Quaid steals it! Liked better then the first one!  Great movie to own!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I didn't want to like this series, anything that gets this much hype has the potential to really disappoint and my faith in public trends is not that high. That being said I was pleasantly surprised by how well these books were written and how engrossed I became in the lives of each caricature.<br /><br />Mockingjay is the last in the trilogy, the wrap up to a very intense few years in the life of of hero, Katniss Everdeen. By now we've been with her through a lot and we're invested, we need to know that there's a light at the end of a very dark tunnel and this book ties everything up for us. I won't say that the ending is neat, we've been with Katniss long enough to know that she is anything but simple, but, over the course of this last book, the author gives us what we need.<br /><br />It's always hard to walk away from a well formed caricature like Katniss Everdeen. This last book dragged in places, and didn't always have the same feel as the other two, but it was a page turner that gives fans of the trilogy a much needed ending point.
B005723JSQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book - absolutely loved the characters:)I would recommend it to anyone/everyone.<br />It was quite a unique storyline and kept you guessing...Great read
B009HELT3C|3.0|Enjoyable movie, didn't think the plot was that much different.  Almost through to the end, the climax of the whole plot, the movie cut out, I could hear sound, no picture.  Backtracked and my  Roku had to reset itself.  Then we got picture and no sound.  Reset again.  Finally finished movie but it was very slow.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|I have only played solo but having a great time. Fast paced and easy to level fast. Gives you a chance to learn before feeding to the wolves.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|They pick up the books and read them without being prodded.  They look forward to new books in the series.  What more can you ask for?
0345803493|5.0|the book is so engaging I had to hold myself back no to read it through by couple of days. I was so excited to get home to my book. I haven`t felt this way to any book I have ever read in my entire life... When I finished it, I needed some time to return to the daily//normal life as I was so into it. I wish there would more books than 3 :)
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I always have this great little sharpener handy for my kitchen and pocket knives.  Puts a nice sharp edge on them in a small, affordable package.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great for kids and adults. Very a addicting it's hard to stop playing. You keep challenging your self to try to do the hardest one's and compete with the family.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Entertaining story that is well written enough that it was easy to really dislike Connor and then almost forgive his stupidity at the end.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I thought this was a great book. Some of the story was not what I was expecting. Which made it better
8866130915|5.0|Moleskine is one of the best notebooks ever designed. I love the quality of the paper and just how the notebooks feel in your hand. Nothing compares to them. The reason I love this style is because on the left side you have the dates of the week and then on the right side you are able to place notes. I use the notes section for to dos and for reminders to get things etc. If you are someone who wants a monthly they have a moleskine for you. The only thing I wish is that they have this style in the multi color but hopefully they will in the future!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is a wonderful love story and so much fun!  Even though the ending is a bit predictable you are still tempted to turn the page!  For an author I've never heard of it was a great book!  5 stars all the way.
B005ES0XVO|3.0|I own other crocs, and a size 10 always fit nicely. The fit on this pair was uncomfortably loose ,even with socks. I must say that amazon's return policy is simple and no charge to return was nice. A pleasure dealing with amazon.
B006TJXZ30|4.0|Seems to work most of the time but it has been spotty in<br />posting mail and hard to file mail once read.
B008RZF1UO|5.0|When I'd learned that the wonderful Roy Khan was leaving Kamelot during their US tour, I was very, very disappointed. I had tickets to see them perform. The concert was still wonderful. But it made me wonder who would fill Khan's very big shoes. I'd never heard of Tommy Karevik but when this album came out, I read some reviews and even though I knew I would be purchasing the CD anyway just because it's Kamelot, I wanted to know that Khan's role had been filled with someone worthy. Tommy Karevik does a stupendous job! I was not disappointed at all. Whether it is intentional or just pure luck, he sounds remarkably like Khan that at times I actually forget Khan was not singing. I know that's probably not the best thing to say about a new singer but when I became a fan of Kamelot in the first place because of Khan's voice, well, to have his successor sound close to him, means I can appreciate the transition even more and grow to love Tommy's voice.This album surpasses Poetry by leaps and bounds, in my opinion. No offense to Khan on that. Poetry for the Poisoned was vocally beautiful but musically kind of dull. But Silverthorn is very much musically like a combination of Ghost Opera, Black Halo and Epica. Thomas Youngblood obviously just needed to get an okay album out between the wonderful Ghost Opera (my favorite) and Silverthorn in order to make Silverthorn beautiful<br /><br />I did have to listen to the whole album twice through completely before I could fully appreciate the beauty of it. Whether it's the powerful opening to the hauntingly beautiful choral  Prodigal Son and the power driven Veritas, Silverthorn has put Kamelot back on the high road to success! I look forward with barely repressed eagerness for the next album!
B006O3MU96|4.0|When I first installed Doodle Jump, I thought it uses direction control to play so when I tilt the tablet in bed, Doodle would continuously jump in one direction.  When I figured out how to play, it was a relatively fun game.  It is very simple game to entertain myself when I'm in line or waiting for someone.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I chose this rating because :<br /><br />_ It was fun and very interesting<br />_ It was none stoible<br /><br />I like this particular part of the book because he stuck  up for himself against Luke. I didn't like this particular part because he was getting bullied all the time and they might have hurt him really bad.
0241951461|5.0|There is so much to love about this book.  It's hard to know where to begin.  Essentially, the book has three different themes.  First, it is an exploration of a time and place that was.  The Greek island of Corfu must have been truly enchanting, and the Durrell family's enthusiasm for the place and people is contagious.  It made me want to see what Corfu is like now, and if any of that enchantment remains.<br /><br />Secondly, the reader sees how a young mind is shaped as the author, at age ten, discovers his love for all things zoological.  Often funny, yet deeply interesting, I was surprised at how much I learned while exploring the native fauna with young Gerry.  Even the bugs are fascinating!<br /><br />Lastly you'll come to know a family like no other, and their equally delightful friends.  There were times that I wanted to brain Larry, the eldest son, (who was the noted author Lawrence Durrell), but he always seems to get his comeuppance, and in ways that are always very fun to read.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough.  It is laugh out loud funny from beginning to end.  The good news is, Gerald Durrell was a prolific writer.  I immediately ordered several more of his books, and look forward to many hours of pleasure with this author.  A book lover couldn't ask for more!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I began reading this I was a little skeptical, but I was hooked with the love and suspense by the third entry. This book is well written and well thought out. I could not put this book down! Literally, I stayed up till 5:30 am to finish it! You will fall in love with Holder and Sky. I am so sad it's over!<br />I will be looking for any book written by this author. I am very impressed. :)
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Amazing how little needs changing for stage or screen adaptation.  Amazing, too, how contemporary the writing style and descriptions. Pure delight.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Really enjoy playing this game. The graphics were terrific. Did not want to stop until the game was completed. Great!!!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|A rather long story, similar in length to Under the Dome.  Suspenseful, not scary.  All in all I enjoyed reading it.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|Another excellent Harry Bosch novel with many twists and turns and the tension remaining right to the very exciting conclusion.
B007HLIUN4|5.0|I found this book a really insightful  and very well researched analysis of why some societies are rich and why some have remained poor. From the reasons that the Industrial Revolution started in England and the political institutions the aided that to some pertinent comment regarding China where the view appears to be that the growth generated in that country will run out of steam. This is  mainly because the Government there has not allowed the development of inclusive political institutions that have driven innovation and wealth in the Western Democracies and Japan.<br />The analysis covers a wide selection of countries throughout the globe from the tragedy of Zimbabwe to the success of Botswana in Africa and the slow development of the economies in South America.<br />It is highly recommended for anyone with an interest in the future of how world powers will develop over coming years.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is a great app! very easy to use and I have not seen any glitches like I have found with other apps on devices.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|its like Oregon trail but with tanks.  this is a slow game.  kinda game u &quot;check in on&quot; and not &quot;play a quick level&quot;
B0079R8IYW|4.0|it's quite good for lots of reading - and for email - propping up the kindle saves a lot of energy!
B0063IH60K|5.0|game is very intertaining.  Selection of types of games is good.  Good for all ages and levels.  Short play time, good for small breaks at work.
B007TK77QE|4.0|This was a much darker story than I guess I was expecting. Very contemporary storyline, and interesting setting in  a small village with all of the in fighting going on. The younger generation characters were portrayed in convincing depth, and showing the angst they tend to be preoccupied with. Devastating ending. This story won't be what readers of Harry Potter novels might expect - although the depth of detail in the story will be familiar. Will appeal to readers who like a story about interactions and relationships and their complications.
B00785P2QC|5.0|A really fun game just like all of the rest of the G5 games.I highly recommend it to anyone of all ages.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|A decent outing, with plenty of action and graphic-novel-level-soul-seaching.  A little preposterous, but no more so than any other of the superhero franchise offerings.  A bit of a let-down at the end, but overall, a fun watch.  The only gripe was Bane's voice, sounding like Capt. Picard talking into a tin can.
0812993292|5.0|Beautfully written.  Last couple of chapters spellbinding.  Teachs all who read the book that life is a journey filled with lifes ups and downs but what we learn along the way is the journey.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|this is a really good app! the only bad thing about it is that it stops playing music a lot. your just listing to music and then it stops for like 5-30 seconds and that's annoying!!!!

B009MCRHH6|4.0|Fun and smooth. No crashing which is generally not the case on my phone.  It is also sufficiently challenging, but at the same time not ridiculously difficult.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this game its a really big family game but husbands beats most of them but really fun kids really love it and when the don't have anything to do they want to either watch me or play themselfs I wish it didn't cost so much for coins but I guess every family should get this its a lot of fun to play and take turns on just don't fight when your turn is up
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I love music. All kinds. I recently heard this song on the radio while driving. I found my self humming the tune frequently. Decided, I really needed this song accessible daily, or as it turns out, multiply times a day. I am not disappointed. I do listen it, am thinking about getting another CD, in case this one wears out, and that I can put in my truck CD player, to always have it on hand. As well as the song I love, the rest of the CD is just as good. I had only seen this group in the commercial, so was not familiar with them. Am so happy that the tune stuck with me. I will definitely be buying more CD's by Lady Antebellum~!~
B006CQLGXG|5.0|I'm a fan of A Christmas Carol. I have both print and electronic copies. I was glad to find the illustrated copy in an e version. It's easy to read and the illustration enhance the reading experience. If you haven't already purchased it, do so promptly. You won't be sorry.

B000W93CHC|5.0|Ken Follett is truly an amazing story teller.  I had to make myself put the book down to finish tasks at hand.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A good suspenseful story with just enough twists to keep you engaged and wondering what's next. I read it in just a few days, and will definitely be checking others by Gillian Flynn.

B008602KQI|1.0|The best thing about the Hunger Games was Woody Harrelson's ridiculously bad hairpiece.  The worst thing about the Hunger Games was everything between the title and the closing credits. These are random ramblings that went through my head as I watched this epic movie.  This is a commentary meant to be read along whilst watching this god awful tragedy.<br /><br />Hey this must be the American version of that cool Japanese flick about the kids forced to kill each other by their government in a death match.  Oh, the author of this book never heard of that book or the movie that was made based on the book or the sequel to the movie.  That's believable, anyway moving on.<br /><br />The costume designers and makeup artists should be forced to play in a Hunger Games style death match.<br /><br />I was beginning to think Donald Sutherland would take any role offered to him for a paycheck, now I know Donald Sutherland will take any role offered to him for a paycheck.<br /><br />Could we watch the boy throwing bread to the pigs flashback one more time please!<br /><br />Nothing tastier than tree bark arm cake!<br /><br />I wonder who's going to win the Hunger Games?<br /><br />Can I pay extra for the 24 hour internet feed?<br /><br />\\"I'm not allowed to bet, but if I could I would bet that this movie sucks.\\"<br /><br />The Hunger Games have started and the kids are killing each other just like in that Japanese movie that this is clearly not a ripoff of.<br /><br />Iron Maiden's \\"Run to the Hills\\" is playing in my head.<br /><br />The media's right, kids watching kids killing little kids has no impact on their psyche whatsoever.  How could it?<br /><br />Not fair, fire!<br /><br />RRRUUUNNN!!!!  You're being chased by bad acting!<br /><br />How did Dolph Lundgren's kid get in this movie?<br /><br />I still don't know why this is called the Hunger Games.  I must have missed a major plot point.<br /><br />Could you explain again about the bees and their deadly venom?  That was worst than product placement.<br /><br />That's convenient, the one kid who dies has a bow.  It just so happens that I'm really good with a bow.<br /><br />My boyfriend saved me, yeah!!!<br /><br />I was a coal miner's daughter.<br /><br />Could we have more flashbacks, the movie's not long enough already.<br /><br />Are people always that loud when they sneak through the woods or is it just my surround sound system?<br /><br />Why do I think every too cute black kid is the spawn of Will Smith?<br /><br />Don't go near the luggage!  It's a trap!!!<br /><br />Hey, I have an idea.  Let's leave the weakest, dumbest kid to guard all our crap.<br /><br />I'm sure glad he killed Will Smith's kid so I don't have to.<br /><br />Could we cry a little less and kill a little more?  This movie is already running way too long.<br /><br />Now we have to pick flowers?  Come on!!! Kill something already!<br /><br />Peace out to all my homies in District 12 beeeotch!<br /><br />Send in the stormtroopers!!!

B008M87GJK|5.0|I like BBC news because it coverage of world wide news it reports more than America new sources good job
B000HEWEJO|5.0|It's a Wonderful Life joins my collection of essential holiday films. Nice to see the classic film without commercial interruption.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|game is really fun. easy at first. never asks for money. harder as you add additional Colors and bigger square.
B005LAIHE0|5.0|Great fun movie, it strangely describes my son and his fiancé. He is from San Francisco, she is from Michigan.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|this book was perfect. i read it in less then three days, i just couldn't put it down. i am a very big reader, and this is the best book i have read so far.
0920668364|4.0|This is the best book for anyone having a baby boy. Just wish they wrote one for baby girl&#34;s. My niece loved it.
B005Y1B3Q0|5.0|I expected it to be more like the second movie and it was't. After that it was a good movie. It has humor, it has stars, and it has a lot of action with more than one storyline going at one time. It also has, don't tell anybody this, emotions, not just from Charisma Carpenter's character. I am glad I bought it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|AWESOME ENJOYED CAN NOT WAIT TO READ THE NEXT TWO BOOKS VERY SEXY CHRISTIAN GRAY INTERESTING MAN ON TO THE NEXT ONE
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Very entertaining & great singing.  Funnier than some might expect.  Husband & son both enjoyed it also.  Give it a chance!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|A comedy and holiday classic. The combination of physical comedy paired with stereotypical family gathering nightmare scenarios make for a movie you can watch again and again and still laugh out loud. Our family watches it every Christmas as a kick off to the holidays.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|Mark Twin wrote this novel well. It explains the hyperactivity and anxiety of growing up in the South and how some of the children handled it.
B0084AXZK0|3.0|Dorian Gray deserved to die a lonely, bitter man. What fascinates me about his story is the way in which he was hammered on by Lord Henry and yet found no room for the good influence of others. Fascinating tale. Skipped the tedious descriptions of Dorian's collections. Ugh. I just couldn't bring myself to care about the diversion.
B006RXQ800|3.0|The story itself is quality - inspired by Herbert Asbury's non-fiction book: The Gangs of New York. Acting by DiCaprio and Diaz was rather POOR, but Daniel Day Lewis - his performance was excellent. He was very convincing in his role - he carried the movie otherwise I would not have continued to watch it. At 166 minutes I found it rather long - thank goodness I had a fast forward option.
0345509617|5.0|Wow, this book is an amazing look at the making of an iconic film. Totally worth the price, especially if you can get it \\"gently used\\".
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Such an amazing novel. I really enjoyed reading this. It was deep and really hit me in the heart. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone.
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|I enjoy listening to all the songs.  Great album.  Can't wait to see them live the end of the month!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Thought provoking, spiritual journey without all of the extreme religious hoo hah. Well written journey through the eyes of a younger man in his quest for enlightenment. I enjoyed seeing him self-actualize in this story.<br /><br />I am re-reading the book.
B0094ZJK4O|4.0|I'm a huge fan of Sambora's first two albums.  He's got a great voice and a seems to write songs that really have some soul to them.  There are usually a few songs on each of his albums I don't really like, like track 1 on this album, but for my tastes he makes up for it with so many other great songs.  I'm so happy he's still creating his own albums, I was worried after the second one that he might not do anymore.<br /><br />Overall this is a really good album if you're a Richie Sambora fan, and if you're not just listen to the preview of the songs and you'll hear the &#34;feel&#34; that Sambora puts into his songs.
B000HL09MG|4.0|It is a very strange film, but I loved it. The images are captivating, and the story keeps you asking more questions.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really didn't want to put the book down. It kept you interested through the entire book, very nicely written.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh - thank you for my conversion to e-reading. I've been trying to move from physical books to e-reading and just knew that if I could find the right book, an outstanding book, it would happen. I LOVED WOOL 1-5. Reading First Shift now. I will forever tie your book to my e-reading experience :)<br /><br />--Steve
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I love that you can mix and match the sounds. The timer is great too. Only thing that could be better was if the app still ran while you were reading or whatnot. Still it's great for relaxing before bed, my daughter loves it too.
B00936A0RU|3.0|The movie was not what I expected, but is base in a real event so is what it is.No a good action movie.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I was really please with the condition of this item. It was a gift, so it had to be pretty nice and well packaged in order for me to give it...and it was!
0800141806|5.0|A great classic movie, just what you dont find in the Theaters any more.I recomended to everyone that like the justice type of movies.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|I am very dissatisfied with this product. I have replaced it once and am about to return my replacement. The phone in the case has been dropped twice from a height of less than 2 feet and the case has broken.  Specifically they have broken in the same spot, a corner. I do not recommend this brand case until this issue has been resolved.
B009LXEBD4|4.0|I never really listened to Kelly before. When Mr. Know It All came out, I loved it. Then when I seen her perform a song with Vince Gill, I knew I had to have this cd. She has alot of great songs on this cd. I'm a new fan.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|It's a Wonderful Life is refreshingly decent material. Wonderful story leaving out all foul language, sex and violence. It is very real to me, real people, real struggles and Godly solutions.
B000PKG7I4|5.0|She lives on in her music.  So much character and soulfulness in her voice. Reminds me a little of Janis Joplin.
B007WKEM8C|5.0|Let me just say that I don't usually look forward to cooking and am not usually excited over cookbooks. This cookbook has changed everything for me. I've only had the book for 3 days and have already made 4 dishes out of it. They have all turned out great! I have made 2 of the breakfast recipes (the whole wheat raspberry scones and cinnamon French toast) where normally I am so uninspired in the mornings that my family is stuck with oatmeal or bacon and eggs. I have also made the braised short ribs and the fingerling vinaigrette with pickled celery and it has all been yum!!<br />Other than inspiring me to cook more, I really appreciate that the ingredients used in these recipes are easy to get and not necessarily expensive. I get very frustrated when I want to follow a recipe and it requires ingredients from a gourmet grocery store (which we do not have where I live) and I have not that experience with this book. Also, the author recognizes that we don't all have fancy kitchen gadgets like stand mixers and gives directions for if you do have them and if you don't.<br />There isn't anything bad that I can say about this book other than I was a little intimidated over how &#34;fancy&#34; the pictures looked and that it would be another cookbook the I looked at and didn't use. Boy, was I wrong!! I am so glad that I bought this book!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Well written and great pace. This book is by far one of my favorites and I would recommend it for anyone into the whole romance, action, and drama. SOOOO GOOD!!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is outstanding --it is both historical and very enjoyable to read--it becomes more and more engrossing as you turn the pages.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|I downloaded this to my kindle fire and the graphics were excellent. It has a decent storyline and the mini games weren't too difficult. All and all a good time consumer.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|bit sad that again todays writers want to ''kill off '' the hero. just the other day i read that spiderman was ''killed ''' mind you it happened to superman too !apart  from this good movie. be interesting to see if they another movie.
B007L96SI6|5.0|I'm a old (emphasis on &#34;old&#34;) Haley fan, and I really like her first album. There are a couple of songs that I think are weak, but I also think it's more that they are weak songs, not Haley's delivery of them. When I get stuck song syndrome these days, it's usually a Haley song. This girl can really sing, and I look forward to her next album.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long while and thoroughly enjoyed!  I was very sad to see it end!
B0016OMFNY|5.0|Just what my husband wanted.  Easy to listen to.  Great music for a party or just sitting around.  So there!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Truly enjoyable. I rarely write reviews, but I desperately need to know what happens next in Silo 17! So I am hoping that encouraging others to read this series will help the author to continue writing it. Completely fresh post apocalyptic novel.
B005IQZB14|1.0|I paid for this book and felt I had to finish it.  If I borrowed it I would have given it back to it's owner after the first chapter.  Cheryl (let's  make up a new name for her) Cathy since she did made up her last name I thought it only right she have a new first name.  So Cathy  was a very ignorant hiker and I was hoping that at the end of the book she would recommend you don't ever do what she did.  A woman alone in the woods that never hiked a day in her life.  What up with that?  The more I read this \\"book\\"  I thought how lame and stupid Cathy was  and how lame and stupid I was to buy this book.  THE END
B000SGRONM|5.0|Holidays on Ice is perfect for those who give no apologies for complaining about the ills of society during the holiday season. It feels nice to have affirmation for the complaints you've been making over the years. Whether it's the tension that mounts while waiting in line to see Santa or the humble-brags found in family Christmas cards, Sedaris seems to have a knack for observing all the naughty acts of the holiday season. I laughed at ever story, without guilt.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|After what happened in the first few pages I was skeptical that this would be a good book, but these two have made yet another amazing book. You will unable to put this book down.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Quite captivating and as always captivating as most of the books written by John  grisham<br /> \\"Not all lawyers are unscrupulous\\"
B002MQYOFW|5.0|reasd this book twice and saw loved it. I have all the 3 books and is waiting patiently for the next movie to comes out.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I love this kind of book.....are there more like it?  Reading both sides, fun.  This girl was crazy..BUT in the end, he was just as bad as she was.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow. I was barely able to put this book down for a second after the first few pages got me completely hooked read this book twice also
B006OOHYIC|3.0|Directions not clear enough. Cute and fun, but can be sometimes annoying.  In spite of all that, it can be addicting.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wow. I was barely able to put this book down for a second after the first few pages got me completely hooked. Read this book twice too
B003O86FMW|4.0|As good as book one, I finished this one in less than a day.  It leaves you with a big cliff hanger.  I need to read the next book - has it been written yet?
B00132D808|5.0|I purchased this CD for my daughter. As per my daughter: All of the songs are awesome.<br />Northern Downpour is amazing.
B0031TZ8TU|5.0|well written, true story that reads like fiction...<br />Another good book by Follet.<br />If you are a Follet fan,  highly recommend this novel.
B000A7Q2DM|4.0|I purchased this for my daughter.<br />As per my daughter: The lyrics are fantastic.  She really<br />likes the drums. Jared Leto's voice is amazing.
B003719G40|1.0|How someone get a book published in which he simply states what everyone already knows is just beyond me.  For instance, Chapman tells us that some people (our partners, specifically) like to get compliments, like to have us do helpful and loving things, etc.<br /><br />So I'm skimming it, occasionally reading one of the examples of couples who misunderstand each other's &#34;love language.&#34;<br /><br />But there's really not much work reading and certainly little that anyone with any awareness doesn't already know in this book.
B009VLX8FS|2.0|I have three daughters who have been Taylor fans since the beginning of her career.  This album is like knock off Disney groupie music. My girls like one song out of the 16 songs.  She repeats the lyrics over and over and the country sound is gone.  It seems like she is trying to be more poppish..I do not like it nor do my daughters.  Also the whole thing about the album being called RED to incourage children to read is such a cimic.. Taylor Swift stated in a interview my girls watched that it was RED because that was her favorite color.  But it is being promoted as RED, Read Every Day. I guess if it helps kids read great..but its not what the album is about.  This is a dissappointing album and I hate to say that Taylor Swift just dropped off my girls randar.  Too many annoying songs.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|Good game. Worked well on the kindle fire. Challenging enough that I had to use the hints a couple of times. Well worth the money spent.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Just an ordinary game of solitaire. Boring but reliable.  Great for passing the time. Easy to play but not that easy to win!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I was so happy with everything! The delivery was quick, Brave Blu-ray DVD arrived in perfect condition, the little girl I gave it to was extremely happy to receive it, I watched the movie from start to finish and it was a perfect DVD - no skipping or scratches or sound problems, it was perfect!<br />Thank you so much!
B007THA4FI|1.0|I became distracted by all the swearing and bad language.  I would expect this from a male author, but I expected better from JK Rowling.
0425252868|5.0|Very rarely does a book affect me at the soul-level like A Higher Call. To say that I was impacted emotionally or that my outlook on war has changed is an understatement. In my opinion, A Higher Call can only be compared to Unbroken. And today, I see that this title has made the NYT best seller list. What's next? The movie? I for one hope so. Seeing this story brought to life on the big screen would be amazing!<br /><br />I would like to thank the author for bringing this story to the written page and honoring the men and women who were witness to this real history. This book is sure to engage and entertain even the most critical history enthusiast or warbird buff (like me). I even convinced my mom to read it and she paged through the entire book cover-to-cover in nearly one sitting (she is anti-war so this is saying something!).<br /><br />While a number of other excellent books documenting WWII exist, A Higher Call stands above the rest in my mind. Where others document one side or the other, this book tells the story from two sides of the war and shows the true sacrifice and suffering by all. Let's face it, in war, no one really wins. A Higher Call brings this reality home by following Franz and Charlie through both good times and bad. As my first read in 2013, A Higher Call has set a new standard for war books.<br /><br />Finishing A Higher Call was a moment of extreme elation and, at the same time, a level of sadness. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and can't stop thinking about the story. I'm also depressed knowing that it will be a benchmark to compare every book I read this point forward and all others are likely to disappoint.
B00633W614|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I enjoy books that want you to keep reading and not put the book down this is certainly one of those. This series is very interesting definitely worth the purchase and the read.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|Old news. Same ols plot. Needless profanity. Girl wants old guy but guy is afraid of her safety. Don't waste your time.

B004GHNIRK|5.0|I Can't wait to read this! I have been wanting to see the play, or even the movie, and now I can read the book.
1600247245|5.0|Loved it! Loved it! Loved it! At first I thought 3 more CDs would just make more descriptive narration. I was wrong. 3 more CDs made a deeper story with lots of conflict. Did I say I loved it?
B005LAII1C|4.0|gift
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love the one touch feature that lets you go thru the game.  Makes those times when you have time, go by quicker.
B004QSQML8|5.0|This movie thrilled me as a child and inspired romance in my youthful heart. I still adore this movie and love, love, love the soundtrack.
0425263908|4.0|Its no 50 but its a good read. If you haven't read any of the books...read 50 Shades series first then Bared to You.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This is a fun game and can be played by children and adults alike! It is a great tool for children to begin and understand strategy.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is amazing.I could play it all day every day.it is just like the computer version but has more to it and it doesn't lag like the computer version.you should get!!!
B00005JMJG|5.0|This is the kind of movie of which you can use to gauge the potential of all future relationships. Sure, you can get along just fine with someone who didn't &#34;get&#34;...or (gasp)... didn't *like* the movie. But you could spend the rest of your forever on a deserted island with a follow lover of this movie and never run out of things to talk about. Not to mention all the potato people you could create together...
0312641893|5.0|My first thoughts after reading the book description for Cinder were \\"This is not for me.\\" Looking back, I tried to figure out why I felt that way. I think it had a lot to do with the terms \\"cyborg,\\" \\"android\\" and \\"lunar.\\" What the heck is this book about?! How can Cinder have anything to do with this?!<br /><br />I'm here to tell you how WRONG I was and how amazing Cinder is. If you're like me and read a light science fantasy (ish) type book every once and awhile (like Unravel Me or Pretties), then trust me, you can handle this book.<br /><br />What makes Cinder fantastic is that it takes the basic elements of the Cinderella story - evil stepmother, working as a laborer, ball at midnight - and gives it new life. Cinder was adopted into the Linh family when she was a child. She was in a terrible hovercraft accident and survived because of the new, metal parts she was given (like her whole leg).<br /><br />After she meets Prince Kai, her daily routine is shaken up. As the top mechanic in New Beijing, Cinder is asked to fix a royal android who has stopped working.<br /><br />There are so many new threads in Cinder that I didn't feel like I'd heard this story over and over. The city of New Beijing is a monarchy in the new world formed after additional world wars (after World War II). Add to that, there's a deadly plague spreading across what's left of the world, and there's no known cure.<br /><br />THEN add that unraveling history of Cinder's childhood and background that she's only just discovering.<br /><br />Phew. It's a wild ride.<br /><br />Cinder is a wholly unique and untold tale. Which is just masterful, as the nuances to the original fairytale are subtly present.<br /><br />Let's talk about romance in Cinder. I was a fan. It wasn't overly swoon-ish, BUT it wasnt' instalove. Thank you!<br /><br />In fact, it was only really in slight touches and side glances that you could really see anything going on, BUT Meyer has me guessing. I hate it when I know for sure what's going to happen in the romance department. It's exciting but not really surprising.<br /><br />I think Meyer is going to totally shock me. Dunno, guys, dunno.<br /><br />OVERALL<br /><br />I was so pleasantly surprised with Cinder. I took a \\"risk\\" by reading a book outside of what I normally read, and it seriously paid off. I highly recommend Cinder, and think it makes a great addition to the YA science fiction scene.what's going to happen in the romance department.

B007SY3CEW|5.0|I love this app for my Kindle Fire HD.  Very easy and the added challange with the scoring grading added to it.  Brought back a lot of childhood memories of learning to play the piano years ago without the space taken up with an actual piano.
B008PE9GSA|4.0|Overall, a good album (CD). What you'd expect from this veteran blue's band. The first track is the stand-out track.
B0014JKJJI|1.0|I am returning this item.  I had another pair (not Crocs) that I was forced to retire because they wore out and thought I would try these Crocs as soon as I tried them on I knew I would have to return them because of the lack of arch support.  When I put my old clogs on my feet went AHHHH not when I put these on.  I wore them for a day around the house to try to give them a fair try and found they were very warm, made my feet hot, no air circulation.  As far as the transation no disappointments there..fast shipping and easy returns.
B0024RID6U|5.0|Been wanting this CD for quite a while, particularly for three great tracks;<br />&#34;Start Me Up&#34;, &#34;Neighbors&#34;, and &#34;Waiting On A Friend&#34;.
B004J4WLB4|2.0|A rather silly story that bored me..kept trying, happy that I only bought it on Kindle, never know!<br />Kindle is good for &#34;not sure&#34; books
B008EZVNO0|5.0|Another stellar effort from the &#34;Grumpiest&#34; of musical artist's. There's seems to be no end to this man's musical prowess.
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|I am a long-time, devoted and enthusiastic fan of the novels (jointly and solo-written) of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child...especially those devoted to the adventures of FBI Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast.<br /><br />Not that each one was a masterpiece...but, each featured some hair-raising danger and the brilliant, laconic, enigmatic...yet never superhero-ish...Pendergast. This theme was consistent troughout the 1st two books of their latest Pendergast trilogy (Fever Dream and Cold Vengeance); which opened a new window into Pendergast's history; placed him in unprecedented personal danger and laid out a plot of international intrigues worthy of Bond vs SPECTRE.<br /><br />Therefore, it was with great anticipation that I started to read the final book: &#34;Two Graves&#34;; and, with greater disappointment that I came to its conclusion. If the two authors had not been so prominent in promoting the book via commercials, Facebook, etc, I would have had to believe that it was a cheap imitation of one of their novels...by a very inferior writer(s).<br />Sadly, it reflects the kind of 'writing' that Preston/Child presented with their 'Gideon' series...a lower level of cheap thrills, ridiculous escapes and leaps of faith that more properly belong in the books of the 'Matt Helm' or 'Destroyer' canon.<br /><br />In Two Graves, the conspiracy turns out to be the work of (gasp!) super-science neo-Nazis, working from a hidden base in the Amazon Jungle (beyond cliche); and, Pendergast is transformed into an indestructible Superhero: combining aspects of Doc Savage, Indiana Jones, Batman...with a little 'Spy Smasher' thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />While past Pendergast novels have always included a touch (or, a lot) of pulp-y SciFi gimmicks (youth serums, monsters created by eating forbidden veggies, etc.) they have always insisted on a level of respect for the reader's intelligence. None of them has ever been as ludicrous, banal, and as plain sloppy as the plotting/pacing/characterizations of 'Two Graves'.<br /><br />While I look forward to the continued efforts of these authors, I may get their next Pendergast novel from my local library, before paying good money for another novel as brainless as 'Two Graves'. Gentlemen, you are better than this!
B005LAIH2W|4.0|Considering all the negative reviews, and the fact that Disney has cancelled plans for any sequels, I didn't have high expectations that this movie would be good, never mind just plain entertaining.  I was pleasantly surprised to discover that I liked it.  Which leaves me to wonder why so many took an instant dislike to it (mostly critics, although that can't explain why so many people didn't bother to see this movie on its initial theater release, thus sounding its death knell).  Yes, the story is a bit complicated (as it always is when people jump back and forth between time and space).  Yes, they could have picked a stronger actor for the lead.  Yes, they had way too many villains to keep track of.  Yes, it's not always a good thing to be cryptic about everything.  But still, the aliens were fantastic, the score was mighty, the special effects dazzling.  I'm definitely keeping it in my collection for future viewings.<br />It was a good, but not great, movie.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|'The Dark Knight Rises' takes damaged-goods hero, Batman into the darkest recesses of his soul, destroys his wealth, hubris and self-delusion (to say nothing of his body), and forces Bruce Wayne into epiphany.<br /><br />Oh, yeah...add in a diabolical plot to destroy Gotham City, some heavy-duty revenge by the League of Shadows (from 'Batman Begins') a brutal, brilliant enemy who is more than Batman's match...and, a complicated relationship with a 'Occupy Wall Street' minded cat-burglar.<br /><br />Bellicose, bombastic and brutal, 'The Dark Knight Rises' is ultimately as uplifting as its title infers.<br />The scale of the film and its ambitions are both monumental, the script forces the viewer to engage their mind and full attention...and, the performances are cathartic.<br /><br />Forget the nonsense about the film validating the rich above the rest of us...its about humanity's endless ability to screw itself up royally, push itself to the brink of annihilation, and then to find the will and grace to rise above its own failures and achieve something of value. That its wrapped up in the Batman's cape & cowl doesn't matter. This is myth-making in the finest tradition; and, as a single film, or the final chapter of a larger tale...remains one of the finest movies of the last several decades.<br /><br />Rent it!
0345803507|3.0|Although I read all 3 books in about a week. I was not thrilled with this series. There is so much repeated over and over. I did enjoy following how thier relationship grew but she annoyed me most of the time. I felt it wasnt realistic at all but then again I dont know any billionaires. lol It had a good twist but then it just kinda fell apart for me.
0307474259|5.0|Gary Taubes takes information that has been available to us for generations, and puts it together in a historical format, connecting the dots for patients AND health care providers. This is not a Diet Book, but rather a simple and logical explanation as to why we gain weight, and why most \\"Diets\\" ulitmately fail. It is not about how much we eat, but what we eat. Nothing in this book was new to me, but as a specialist in the field, it presented the information in a way that most people can understand. I congratulate Mr. Taubes on his work , and would suggest this to anyone with concerns or issues with weight gain, and strongly suggest health care providers read this and suggest that patients read it also.
B0034G4P8A|1.0|I bought this almost a month ago and I cannot get the digital copy version to work.  Contacted Paramount multiple time with no answer back.  If you are buying this for the digital copy is not worth it.

044656740X|5.0|it changed mine.  I bought this copy for a friend.  I read this years ago and soon after started investing in real estate.  I now work for myself and do what i love.
B004U8VWLE|1.0|Slow, boring and a waste of time watching. I can't believe the hype on this movie. Watching the news would have been more entertaining.
B007N9FKCY|4.0|This game has the feel of Mario Bros. on Nintendo. Graphics are good and though the game is pretty easy for me to beat it, my 5 year old finds it very fun and challenging. The graphics are great on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and so far the game has been played on an almost daily basis for my 5 year old who changes his mind about everything. Good game.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This app is easy to use.  I have used it for everyday calculations such as balancing my check book, etc.

B003H4I4JU|3.0|An excellent bridge between the first and third book in the series!  A little slow till the last 100 pages but an excellent book that ends well.
B009D0LBRO|3.0|First of all, it is a great game it really is. The problem is on the kindle fire it lags  and it controversy thing it needs a TUTORIAL cause I am a first time using this game on the kindle fire!

1400067820|5.0|This is not an investment guide.<br /><br />This is not a fitness guide.<br /><br />This is not a diet guide.<br /><br />This is not a screed against the dismal science.<br /><br />This is not a call for fundamental economic and political change.<br /><br />This is not an autobiography.<br /><br />This is, as Taleb himself has called it, a work of philosophy which touches on all of the above. I'd also call it a field guide to understanding important parts of the natural and social worlds. It finds much inspiration in the ancient texts of the Mediterranean. Taleb says \\"moderns have severe handicaps when it comes to wisdom\\".<br /><br />We rely, he argues, too much on the illusion of knowledge, too much on false precision, ignorantly intervene, centralize our decisions, try futilely to avoid random risk. Taleb practices \\"naturalistic risk management\\" - ways of minimizing bad risk and benefiting from the \\"Extended Disorder Family\\": uncertainty, variability, imperfect knowledge, chaos, volatility, time, the unknown, randomness, error, and stressors\\". Weak things are hurt by disorder; robust things are unchanged, and, as the title indicates, Taleb's coinage \\"antifragile\\" designates those things benefitting from disorder.<br /><br />Taleb's book has whole charts placing everything from types of literature to ways of thinking to stress to economic systems to medicine to errors into the appropriate column of this Central Triad of reaction to disorder. He may be, as he says, given to \\"angry, dismissive, and irascible\\" prose, but there is a missionary zeal behind this work. Before thanking the reader at the conclusion for reading the book, he embraces disorder as not only potentially life altering in a good way but the key to life's zest, accomplishment, and ethics. Taleb, as he often notes, has plenty of \\"F*** you\\" money by applying his ideas successfully in the world of finance, so money is not the primary motive for this book. He so wants you to be exposed to these ideas that he uses a barrage of ideas to get his points home. There is an opening laying out important concepts of the book and providing a roadmap to the rest of the book. There is a glossary. There is a bibliography. There's a ten page appendix graphically summarizing the book. There is a highly technical appendix with mathematical arguments. Taleb promises a free e-book with the most elaborate supporting technical documents and arguments. There are quotes from Roman and Greek and Arab classics. There are historical anecdotes. There are personal anecdotes - usually negatively reflecting on famous economists - from Taleb's life. There are the dialogues between Nero, a fictionalized version of Taleb, and Fat Tony. The latter is the opposite of Taleb, unintellectual and inarticulate but illustrative of Taleb's caution that unintelligible is not unintelligent and many facts are irrelevant in successfully making money off suckers - the speciality of Nero and Fat Tony.<br /><br />Taleb on investment: a barbell strategy of investing mostly in safe options with ten percent in highly risky - but potentially highly profitable - stock.<br /><br />Taleb on fitness: your body probably doesn't benefit most from regular, low-grade exercise but, rather, from random, high output, high stress exercise. He talks about his own experience in bulking up after a bodyguard (hired after Taleb's public and successful predictions of 2008's financial crisis resulted in death threats) introduced him to the idea of simply trying short workouts where he just tries to best his personal record of weight lifted.<br /><br />Taleb on health: your body probably doesn't like regular feeding or eating things your ancestors didn't eat. It needs the stress of deprivation occasionally.<br /><br />Taleb on economics: intervention by the \\"Soviet-Harvard\\" school of economists causes a great deal of havoc. There is a tyranny of talkers who never pay the price for their bad advice - unlike the old days when bankers incharge of failed institutions were executed.<br /><br />Taleb on social and political change: we need to force politicians and leaders to put \\"skin in the game\\" whether it's making war or running a company. The \\"principal-agent problem\\" was solved in the old tradition of the captain going down with his ship, the Roman engineer being forced to camp out under the bridge he built. The modern economic elite too often socialize loses and privatize profits. Limited-liability corporations should be curtailed, corporate officers' personal assets be placed at risk in certain circumstances.  Globalization is economic efficiency, but efficiency is the enemy of reliability. We rely too much on the false precision of models. Massive 19th Century building projects were often completed much closer to schedule than modern ones because there was not the illusion of proper planning facilitated by computers crunching metrics.<br /><br />I don't take Taleb as an absolute guru. I disagree with him somewhat on the harm stemming from large corporations though I would certainly support the notion that, in effect, \\"too big to fail\\" is too big to be allowed to exist. On a more minor level, I don't agree with his opinions on science fiction's lack of literary worth -- which partly stems from Taleb's justified suspicion of \\"neomania\\" - or his hostility to private gun ownership in America. But I do think this and his [[ASIN:081297381X The Black Swan: Second Edition: The Impact of the Highly Improbable: With a new section: \\"On Robustness and Fragility\\"]]are important reminders of our systematic mental fallibilities and the inescapable role of randomness in the world. And there is a welcome humanity - as well as a modified application of the stoicism of Senca to the modern world - in Taleb's efforts to acknowledge, accept, and use the chaos around us.<br /><br />In short, I do consider this a modern work of wisdom.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|This was so boring. I almost fell asleep for half of it. Even someone who needs to read this, I am telling you DON'T! This is so boring
B005LAJ16I|4.0|I purchased Homeland: the Complete First Season at a very reasonable Black Friday price and have thoroughly enjoyed the first three episodes, Pilot, Grace, and Clean Skin  They cure a cold faster than chicken soup. One does wonder why there are so many sex scenes in just the first three episodes, but they are not problematic.  My complaint is about the difficulty selecting the episodes. Coming back the next day after watching Pilot the only way I could get to Grace was to fast forward. Nor is there any way to do scene selections. The disk seems to be missing links and maneuverability found in other segmented DVDs. I'm enjoying the shows themselves, but don't want to struggle bringing up the sections I want to see.
B00999VI0Y|4.0|This works well if you remove the iphone 3gs adapter. I like that it supports several Bluetooth players without having to resync each time. Bright blue light can get obnoxious at night so I just lean a credit card over it.

He begged for it, and I told him that it was not on his Christmas list, but really It was already under the tree he was so happy because he loves to read.

In between the 20 performances is behind the scenes footage where rihanna talks about tour life and you get a peak inside the international stars jet setting Singer life style. My favorite part was when rihanna and her friends were putting on a birthday party for a crew member/friend, rihanna laugh is so infectious.

B009MCRHH6|5.0|From Grandpa who came here in 1950 to the latest Grand-daughter at 3 years this is a hit.<br />That says it all.
B000GCFY0I|1.0|This book's plotline was irrisistably appealing, yet for the amount of potential it held I was sourly dissapointed. The idea behind the story was pure brilliance, and of course I fell for the boy- how could I not? He led me through the novel and towards the sequel (which honestly proved itself to be equally unimpressive).<br /><br />  The main character failed to move me, I usually take to girls instantly, yet something in her voice was frustrating, dull, and almost incomplete. I think it was the way all of her thoughts were so superficially oriented-the time it took for her to open her eyes was painstaking. Nothing was as deep as it could have been, and unimportant things were unnessicarily elaborated upon.<br /><br />  I don't know…I really hate bashing a sucessful book, but the writing was in truth one of the greatest let downs I have ever encountered. Everyone's self orientation almost drove me to abandoning the book out of frustration. Unwillingness to accept that everything you grew up believing was a lie is understandable. Still, when someone continues their completely oblivious mindset even as truth stares them in the face (in the form of a cute guy)… as I said, its frustrating.
B007R41E8O|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game.  I really like the way (as in other Alawar games) you can skip a puzzle if you really get stuck.  The graphics are great with some pretty nice cutscenes.  The developer did a great job &amp; obviously spent a lot of time &amp; effort on this game.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|How could you not love these little movies about Tinkerbell.  They are so sweet and my granddaughter loves them. Anytime a movie teaches a good lesson in entertainment form is a good thing
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game is one of the best point &amp; click adventure/hidden object games available.  The graphics are great and the storyline was fun and a little creepy at times.
1610390938|4.0|Good discussion on what has earler been said about economics of poor. Analyses the issues, builds on earlier work and provides steps forward to solving some issues. For anyone interested in well-written economic argumentation on how most of the people on our planet are living.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|You will not find a better game of this type.  It's a great point and click adventure/hidden object game with a bit of a twist.  You search for the pieces of objects and must find all the pieces before an object can be used.  The story is fun, the graphics are top-notch, and the price is a steal.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|It was a little disappointing for me. This was so dramatically a cut version of a book that book was so  vividly painted a story.
B003E74B24|5.0|I loved this quick read. You get a greater sense and background of chef. I enjoyed the basic info without the time needed to read a full novel. My husband and I are huge fans!!!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The hunger game books were so good and I couldn't put them down! Highly recommend this series has funny parts action romance and drama
0345803493|5.0|I really like this book.  However, the story is slow moving and somewhat predictable.  I will continue reading and hope it moves a little faster.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Not since I was a young teenager when I read the LOTR series. With 4 kids, dogs, some farm animals - IF I have time to read it's always something education. How to's and the like. But my BIL got me and my husband turned onto the shop and said the books are better. Onto the Kindle they went and sure enough - they are better!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read! The ending is so shocking and amazing I want to read more? But they left you wondering about Peeta... :) &lt;3
0307279189|4.0|Maybe I should've read the reviews a little more closely before choosing this book, but I assumed it was primarily about the search for the Tarahumara and their running prowess...well there was a little about that; however, the book is primarily promotional material for barefoot running!! Macdougall incorporates some of the scientific evidence supporting his view that humans were created to run and the human feet did not need all the cushioning and support that most runners now have become dependent on.<br /><br />I found his arguments somewhat persuasive as it has me seriously considering buying a pair of Dunlop volley (cheaper version of Nike free). But, I am not 100% convinced yet as he does not discuss any of the drawbacks (and I am sure there must be some) of barefoot running and does not offer some of the research that has been undertaken showing barefoot running creates other injuries.<br /><br />Having said that, Born to Run is not a running science book (like Lore of Running, for instance) and my rating acknowledges that.<br /><br />This book is very readable and hard to put down, even for someone still not quite convinced about barefoot running. In fact, I found it so interesting (and due to a lack of photos in the book, which I think is a weakness of the book) that I searched for images of the Tarahumara Indians, Caballa Blanco and the Copper Canyon ultramarathon as I was curious to see what they look like.<br /><br />Overall though, I still consider it a very well written (in terms of style rather than the research aspect) and easy to read book that I would highly recommend to anyone.

B00AQF8CJ0|1.0|It's mildly entertaining until you decide to use the mushroom power, and then it just displays &#34;processing&#34; and never resumes the game. A lame waste of $0.99.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Product Worked as expected. Shipping arrived fine.<br /><br />I prefer the Sony controllers to third party because of the easiness of build in support. The few third party I have had all require a usb and feel different when you start using them.

0425252868|5.0|When I say it reads like a novel, that is meant as high praise. This true story of aviators at war has all the ingredients of a Hollywood blockbuster. Except that if you didn't know better you would say that the story was too incredible and unbelievable. To know that every word of this excellent book is TRUE is mind-blowinng. To know that this is the author's first book and that he is not yet 30 is staggering. Simply put, a phenomenal pageturning epic!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After hearing stellar reviews about this book I was expecting this book to be the greatest book ever. Unfortunately that was not the case. Personally I couldn't get pass how badly this was written and how one dimensional the story is. I barely made it into chapter 2 before I had to call it quits because the writing style was way too juvenile for me. If you're looking for a book that's going to captivate you and keep you engaged then this is not the book for you.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Our family plays a lot of games and this is one of our new favorites!  It's a lot of fun for kids and adults alike.  :-)

B00AKEMHCA|5.0|best game ever. best game that ever existed!!!!  no game better than bloons tower denfense 4!!!! love it wish it was free
B0086700CM|5.0|downloaded this game, played for a few minutes, and was unimpressed at first. thanks to the boredom that took took over shortly after, I started playing it again and now I have a hard time putting it down! great little game with good graphics that don't slow my kindle down whatsoever. very addicitve as well! looking forward to future games from this maker.
B008I3QZKU|5.0|After almost 10 years as a band the Killers just keep getting better and better. This album is incredible. Full of toe-tapping riffs and melodies, they are one of the great indie-rock bands that will beat the test of time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game its super awesome and cool I just need to know how to update it please tell me
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Dylan is one of the few artists of the 20th century that will be remembered 500 years from now. He is like the pyramids, you just have to stand back and gape. That being said it is hard to review a latter-day Dylan record. I am 28 years old and not your typical Dylanphile, I love his early work as most people do. However I tend to listen to his latter-day (1997 up) just as much. This album ranks as his second best latter-day albums, slightly behind the magnificent Love & Theft. Too me the highlight of the album comes halfway through with Long and Wasted Years and Pay in Blood. Both songs are the best he has done since Working Man Blues #2 way back in 2006. His voice has gotten worse but he uses it quite effectively. The last time I saw him in concert was the end of August 2012 in Rochester, MN. He is a national treasure and needs to be seen live to be fully appreciated. Love you Bob may you stay forever young!
B006GWO5NE|1.0|Got cable with kindle fire when we bought it and it doesnt work either. Told amazon that an they said this one would work and it doesnt. Also later bought another kindle fire and that cable does not work either on our laptop. Had to buy adapter that plug into the wall, so we have to take turns charging our kindles. it just doesnt work.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|This story is tangled, thrilling, fast-paced and unique.You will find it difficult to put it down. I highly recommend up it!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|As I am new to the world of erotica, I don't have a very varied basis of books to go on as far as what is considered good or not by this genre's standards. I did enjoy the book, there are many sexy moments that take place, but I realized that I need a little more romance that is not almost entirely based on just how good the sex is. Also, there are moments that border on violence and descriptions of the main character's 'member' that to me were just unappealing. I am sure that there must be readers that had no problem with that. It would have also been nice if the writer did not take whole phrases and words that were used in the Fifty Shades of Grey series. That was a bit disappointing. It is CLEAR that this author was inspired by those books, but certain things are a little too similar for my taste. If I wanted to read another version of Fifty Shades, I would have just re-read Fifty and be done with it. As the Crossfire series has been my first introduction to Sylvia Day, I am tempted to read other books of hers that were written before Fifty Shades was published to see if she uses the same terminology and subject matter. This series feels as if it trying really hard to be much more raw by going straight for the sexual jugular and skimming over the romantic aspect, which I was surprised to find out, that I actually need in the erotic novel that I read. Again, I am new to this world, but romance makes the sex all the sexier and much more erotic.....for me.
0345803493|5.0|This is the best book out of the three. It was a fairly easy read because the story was so interesting, I couldn't put the book down.

B0019IB0II|5.0|I first heard Dr Taylor speak on TED about her stroke and got fascinated by the way a scientific mind analyses what is happening to the mind itself in this devastating situation, but moreover, it recovers to tell the story to all those who never experienced a stroke, but will now be able to understand what happens to those that do in so much more detail. The language in which this book is written is beautiful. It flows and captivates you while educating you along the way.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Hi all  this is a good movie , with lots of action and much like the Bourne triology in the<br />past , The ending is very Interesting . worth watching  with a bowl of pop corn .

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a great book!I read it in less than a day. I couldn't put it down. At first I thought it was gonna be like a lot like other books I have read but it was so much better. I recommend this book for anyone looking for a sweet romantic , suspense thrilling read it will not disappoint. College Hoover is one of my favorite authors if you have not read slammed you need to.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|really enjoyed this book and makes you \\"put the emphasis on life.\\" I think I'm ready for book #2 of the series!
B008WCP2PG|5.0|While the plot isn't that great and the ending is downright stupid, I still love this movie. Who wouldn't love hot men shaking it!? I figured the plot would be mediocre at best so I didn't have high hopes. I just wanted to see some sexy men on my television! Also, the bonus scene is NOT on the DVD it's only on the BLU-RAY which was not stated clearly when I pre-ordered this. I was very disappointed about that because I thought I was getting the steamy bonus scene!!!
B0086DBE62|5.0|Watched this movie with my 6 year old granddaughter and she really enjoyed it.  Great for adults but not so much action that it scares younger children.  Great improvement over original Disney version of Snow White which scared my grandchildren so badly we had to turn it off after just a few minutes.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I can't get enough of this! I love Bruno Mars and this is a great album! I love every single one of his songs although Locked Out Of Heaven is getting wayyy overplayed so I skip that song since I can't stand hearing it anymore. If it wasn't so overplayed I would definitely be listening to it over and over again like the rest of the songs. My favorite song BY FAR is Gorilla. It has a catchy tune and the lyrics are hilarious. If you're offended by sexual connotations and gestures this album is not for you. Most of his songs are about sex or have to do with it. Moonshine is an absolute great song as well as Money Make Her Smile, Treasure, and Young Girls. They have a catchy beat and you'll find yourself dancing and totally jamming out to every one of his songs.
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|Fun to watch...dosen't pretend to be more than an action movie filled with colorful characters with inhuman prowess...making us all wish there was such a person in real life.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I liked the credibility of the author and his approach to telling his story. He gave a scientific explanation of  his predicament and explained the mystery of what waits for us in the next life.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was  an excellent book! One that is hard to put down. I found myself in the mid 1900's and I didn't  want to leave
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Was hoping for more action. This book didn't have me on the edge of my seat awaiting the turn of the page. I just longed for it to end.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|It is a fun game but I wish it had more levels for the free version. It is simple to navigate.
B007SGM084|5.0|Very well written.  Holds your interest .  Very compelling story about a very interesting lifestyle. Hope there are more chapters to come.
1442354747|5.0|I gave this book to someone who enjoyed the movie and who has a huge civil war knowledge base.  He loved it!  I purchased the audio CD and he listens to the book on the way to work and back.  Anything written by Doris Kearns Goodwin will be well-written, too.
B002ZG97M4|4.0|Good remake of a classic Kevin Bacon movie. Followed storyline. My children loved it. recommend to all ages. would buy again
B009JBWOU0|5.0|3 movie were great. Got them for my daughter. She was very happy. plus can not beat the price. Stores charge that for the dark knight rises.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Excellent book! I thoroughly enjoyed this book from beginning to end. Could not put it down. Will recommend this book.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This book was not at all what i thought it would be. It was so much better. The characters are complex and the plot is surprisingly not so predictable.  If your into twilight or the hunger games you might really enjoy this book and its prequel.
B001NHNG64|2.0|Very dry reading , too much tech Info. Seemed like child's was just trying to fill pages.. I enjoyed other teacher books slot more then this one.
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|I got this app for free but on the second round it wouldn't let my stick person move the only reason I got this is beacause it was free I wouldn't waste my $ on this app
B007DIQC90|5.0|Purchased this for myself on a whim when ordering other music (as gifts) and am I ever glad that I did.  Who knew that some of the best music of 2012 would hail from Iceland?  Dubbed as one of the sleeper hits of the year, this release is solid from start to finish, with each track being good seperately and great taken as a whole.  At first listen, put me in the mind of storytelling and fairytales but with each subsequent listen, while that feeling remains, there is also a more going on and whatever you want to call it, it works.  Got the same feeling of discovery from this release as I did when I first came across Mumford and Sons, &#34;Sigh No More&#34;.  Looking forward to hearing more from Of Monsters and Men in the future.
B001NHN7TU|5.0|Use to watch this movie as a kid so I really enjoy it now! It's cheesy and fun to watch :-)
B006QVRUS2|3.0|Did not like the movie but made a great Christmas gift. Good performers but for me a bad storyline. Thanks.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a wonderful book from beginning to end! I read it in one night. I would recommend it to anyone!
B0062P332Y|4.0|Big Jason Statham fan and this movie did not let me down. I have all of this actors movies and now he will be staring with Jennifer Lopez in a coming soon movie.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Interesting games and great way to pass the time when bored. I'm afraid to admit I actually struggled with some of the games.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Got this game as a FAOTD and ended up playing it for hours on end for a week. I've enjoyed similar construction games, but this one has an additional fantasy element which I feel propels the game foreward, and keeps the player entertained. Good graphics and sound.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I have to admit, the last time I bought a CD was for Doo-Wops & Hooligans!  This says a lot regarding the type of artist Bruno Mars is.  Unorthodox Jukebox is just as good!  It has all types of music genres instead of just sticking to one type.  The CD itself arrived without a scratch and wrapped in its original plastic. I haven't stopped listening to it since it arrived.  Definitely a great buy!
B009CGB1SS|5.0|Who could not love Grig? He's brilliant, funny, remarkably expressive and thoroughly likeable. This is a very lightweight Sci-fi teen flick from the pre-internet era. It's fun and full of humor. It does not take itself too seriously, nor does it step on its own feet. And I have to say it - even if it were mostly terrible, I'd watch it for Robert Preston's performance. It's a blatant reprise of a grittier Professor Harold Hill. This is a persona that Preston did better than anyone else, and he delivers brilliantly. The pace is good, the star-wars-type violence is sterile and clean.
B004IV32HU|3.0|I think this movie was okay. Nothing great. The acting was good. I found Sarah Jessica Parker's character extremely annoying. Johnny Depp was terrific and so was Martin Landau. I fell in loooooove with Vampira. OMG was she soooo sexy. Patricia Arquette was really cute and I liked her character a lot. Overall a good movie but I didn't mind it ending.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The title of the book may be Hopeless but the book itself is full of hope. Sky is one of the strongest characters I have ever read about. With all the curve balls throughout the book, Sky takes every one of them and hits a home run. Five stars for Hopeless!
B005HSL626|4.0|I would give this game a 5 star if there weren't so many ads. They just pop up in the middle of a game or after a game. Other than that, it's a good game :)
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This is a fun game and I enjoy it. Graphics are good and my 9 year old loves it. We just wish you could earn peanuts and not have to buy stuff with real $$. This is what ruins it for us.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Loved the game. Got the paid version so I could see how it all ended. I wish more games like this were free.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is the second book in a trilogy, since there is such a huge time factor in between the release of each book, it took me a bit to get back into the characters,I found the book to bounce all over the place to start with, but once I got into it, was an excellent read, far better than \\"Giants\\", but I enjoy the history of WWII.  Look forward to the 3rd book which will not be released until 2014, but hey, no one can write a 1000 page novel with a snap of your fingers.  Well worth every penny.  Well done Ken Follett!!
B0079R8KO0|5.0|So  many to choose from didn't know  which to pick.  Price, looks and reviews steered me towards this one.  It looks and performs better than I had hoped.  If you want a bling or flashy cover, this isn't it.  It looks like a really nicely bound book.  Although not leather, it hasn't disappointed.  Stands up the easel easily, too.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The first book was one of the most exciting books I have read in a while.  So, when it came to book two I didn't think it was very entertaining or written well.  Book three was much better than two and held your attention. However,  it was not quite the same caliber as the first book.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King 's story with descriptions put me in the story...would make a great movie...and best book I have read in a long time.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Suspenseful just enough to keep you intrigued, love the characters and how they develop over time, romantic story with a happy ending
B003DTMUOE|5.0|This book is a way to guide through a personal achivements and the difficulties we will face during the journey. Highly recommended !!
B007X4ECLY|2.0|WHAT A WASTE OF FILM. I'VE SEEN BETTER ACTING AT A THIRD GRADE CHRISTMAS PLAY. HOW CRAP LIKE THIS GETS PRODUCED, I'LL NEVER KNOW. TYPICAL HOLLYWOOD TRASH. MAKE 'EM QUICK. FORGET THE QUALITY...
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Considering this was the last of the series, I thought it was great. In reality, Batman would age and his body broken over time. I thought it was great seeing him giving his all & then stepping away into a more normal and happy life at the ending.<br /><br />Hopefully, there will be someone soon who will put on the cape and a new Batman series will begin that has been as good as this last one!
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|This is a simple and straight forward app for journaling, or writing ???.  I have a couple of things wish it had. I can't seem to draw and write on the same page. and I can't find a way to remove lines once I chose to have them to start with.  But still like the app
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I downloaded this for my new Kindle, still learning to use it.  I<br />hope this helps with playing flash games
B003JTHXOK|5.0|What a wonderful story. It was so well written and the words just seemed to flow. The twist in the story keep me on my seat and I couldn't put the book down. Such an amazing story.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|A great book, with many interesting ideas to mull over and written in beautiful English. It is a relatively short read, but it is one of those books that is so packed that it definitely demands multiple read-throughs.  I will say that it is not a very suspenseful book, so it does take some degree of discipline to go through, but it is so good and such a masterpiece that the journey is definitely worth it.
B007CKNX28|5.0|Love him!  He's a great talent and I can't wait for his next solo or Raconteurs effort  :)  Actually, this is probably one of the more cohesive solo albums he's put out.  He taps heavily into the blues and throws a bit of Nashville in there while remaining kinda rock-y.  It's a fun listen!  My one and only complaint about the CD I received has nothing to do with the music .. it was a Christmas gift and it arrived in a badly cracked CD case.  So I'd give the seller 4*'s but the album definitely gets 5*'s!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Not generally my cup of tea, but very good read. Been a King fan for well over thirty years, and this was a pleasant find.
6302642299|5.0|For anyone who enjoyed the little mermaid, Ariel's Undersea Adventures are classic cartoons that capture what life would be like for an adventure seeking young mermaid. In these episodes, Ariel and flounder along with sebastain try to raise a lost baby killer whale in secret. Then, in episode two, Ariel meets a young merboy who's fallen in with the wrong crowd. Two great adventures sure to delight both children and parents alike as they learn valuable lessons and have fun doing it!
B003719G40|5.0|The five love languages is a great way to get back on track with any relationship, worth a read if the relationship was worth something!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest and this app makes it super easy to get to my favorite site. I love all the great links and the layout is perfect on my phone and Kindle Fire.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|Great movie<br />still in original packaging<br />packaging was clean and arrived fairly soon<br />wonderful movie<br /> Nothing better than a classic
B00A2AU0KI|5.0|This is a very good movie. We enjoyed it and would recommend this to everyone. Clint's movies are all good.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Very exciting. But I like these kind of games. It's interesting just to see how far you can go in this game and what happens at the end. If you like finding objects this is a good one.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This is like the next chapter of the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  You know all the characters and the story continues with more about the past.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I couldn't put this down. Read if you like cyberpunk like William Gibson...<br />Kind of a teen element to it but it works for all age levels and especially for those late 70's / 80's babies. I kept saying to myself, &#34;I remember that!!!&#34; or &#34;I used to (or STILL) LOVE that!!!&#34; after every page.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|If I were to pick my favorite songs from the movie and put them on an album, these would all be there! Love it!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|i bought this game because of the positive reviews and because i wanted something that would consume my brain for a while - most games bore me pretty fast. i thought i would have trouble learning how to play, but i started on &quot;easy&quot; and found myself filled with glee as i killed off the world's population. the only problem i have with it (and it's not bad enough to remove a star) is that there's no &quot;pause&quot; button, not that i can find anyway. i would like to be able to pause my game if the phone rings or something. but you can &quot;save and exit&quot; and then resume your saved game later.  anyway, this game is terrific fun, with great graphics and an even greater sound track. i hope that the one game i have played so far is an indication of things to come (i mean fun, not that the world should really be destroyed) because it might just be the best game i've ever played. i really do wish there was a pause button though.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Fast paced and entertaining. I had a hard time following the battle maneuvers but it did not distract my attention. I am looking forward to read other books from this author.
B0091LF2QQ|5.0|No really, he is. This album is possibly the best one yet. Not a single song to skip over. I can't wait to see if he comes back to the US for another tour.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book is one of the best love stories I have read on a long time. The emotional challenges that both of the characters had due to traumatic childhoods made me feel a deep connection and drew heart felt sensitivity and emotions that I haven't felt while reading a book in a long time. The passion and caring that  they had for each other was intense.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I love Sci Fi, but lately it seems that a lot of Sci Fi movies are more focused on the special effects than the story and the acting.  This movie is quite the opposite - there aren't any effects to speak of, but the acting is fantastic and the story is very engaging.  It won't make a ton of sense as you go, but at the end it all comes together in a very satisfying way.  I'd strongly recommend Looper.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This movie doesn't overwhelm you with trivial stuff appearing to fly out of the screen at you.  The 3D effects are just right!
B006P96PAO|5.0|My son's father recommend that I watch this to understand how committed he is to being a better father after watching this.  I loved it.  I did cry during parts of it.  I still want to see more from this film maker.<br />I would recommend it to fathers everywhere.  If everyone followed the guidelines this movie suggests, we would have almost no divorce and no teenage problems.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Riveting.  Kept me on the edge of my seat.  Can't wait to read the next one.  I am sure I won't be disappointed.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Enjoyable and quick paced. Kept your interest. A fun book.  Just what I needed to end cold winter  nights. Pure entertainment.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|if u play this game u will not like it u will love it ,I love it so u should to,<br /> I play it all the time I never get tired of it
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love his books and especially the Harry Bosch series.  Hope he never stops writing them.  Thank you Michael Connelly.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love this game because it is really cool and easy u should get it and at least play one level Angry birds is the best game u could ever play ,get it!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Entertaining read.  Enjoyed it.  Compelling set up, strong voices, clever.  I have a feeling her other books are even better.  This one had some flaws but definitely worth the read.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|A masterpiece, a beautiful display of the struggle for a land that all &#34;lay claim to&#34;. While it may not be historically accurate, it really feels like you're watching a very entertaining, and truthful story of the Middle East.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|awesome for kids and family a awesome kid game little kid game I mean anyone can play it all can play but specifaclly for little kids its also a puzzle game
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|My favorite Sci-Fi flick. Most don't know of this film, or just avoid it on purpose. But if you're into Sci-fi mysteries, then this is worth a look.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What an amazing story! I have never gotten through 3 books so fast. I look forward to anything E L James writes in the future.
B001993Y3G|5.0|It's the Prince of Thieves, whats not to love. I'm a robin hood fan since I was a boy, I can't get this less than 5 stars.
B0000024YL|5.0|I bought this to replace my old vinyl record.  For a cheap buy, it was great to pop in and listen to once again.
B000HC2PCM|5.0|A welcome addition to my Country collection...could listen over & over...I would highly recommend this CD...it's a winner for sure..
B007FG9LIE|4.0|It was a good read  I would recommend to anyone would likes suspense. My wife is reading it now and enjoys it
B005HSL626|4.0|When you're in the mood for mindless fun, this is the one.  It's fun to make a mess you don't have to clean up!
B008OOYALE|5.0|Fun game. Couldn't figure out how to transfer to my new kindal fire hd so just started a new game now I play on both devices. Twice the fun
B004SUWR2C|5.0|This game has great graphics, nice ability to customize how you want to play.  I have to wait 4 hours at an activity for my son - this made the time fly.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I was wanting to hear more about  his experiences in heaven. I have had a n d e from anaphylactic  reaction shrimp .It only lasted a short while but yes I felt loved and at peace as the e m t s worked to revive my body.I was above watching and anticipating what was to happen  next content when I got angry at what they were doing and instantly I was gasping for air fighting to stay in this life for my children in this body.what is next I didn't  really read it as to any of heavens life.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I started reading this and it felt nice. I had a smile on my face the whole time. Sky is funny, and likable and has a great sence of humour.<br />Enter the guy. At this point I was realy enjoying a light book, cute teenage romance, funny wrighting, you know - something very nice to make the afternoon pass faster.<br />Then the book took a U-turn. On a freeway.<br />I could not put it down and I read the rest of it in one sitting.<br />I highly reccomend it!
B00005JNX0|4.0|This was a gift and I am so glad it shipped when it was supposed to and works like it should.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Classic. Not sure how I made it this long in life without reading this story. As usual... book is better than movies.
B00005V9IJ|4.0|This was a gift and I am so glad it shipped when it was supposed to and it works like it should.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Would recommend to readers of all ages. Read as a family and book was enjoyed by all. Can't wait to complete the series.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|just the right app for quick calculations.  easy to download and use.  no fancy keys or distractions just do<br /> the math.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|This product is very easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone that wanted to import their pictures from their camera to their iPad.
B009E3EY38|4.0|The sound of the cd  is incredible. the video is excellent. Led zeppelin are old but still they rocks. I like it so much.
B00004YRQA|5.0|Of course you need to have a memory card if you're going to save your God of War or Madden game! Even with the shipping cost, it was still cheaper than buying one of these at Gamestop.
B007N8RULO|4.0|you cant play a game without a pop up add.  good game. annoying adds which you have to dismiss quickly or wait for the whole add to play out
B000002L82|5.0|This is one of the best albums by New Order. Every song on it is unique in its own way. New Order are one of those bands that just keep on making great music.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|A great read.Could hardly put it down. a unique story and one that should be appreciated,especially during our era.Makes you rethink about technology and if you are really using your time here on Earth wisely.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|It kept my attention through out the whole movie.  Some great stunts.  A lot of action.  A pretty good plot.
1451648537|5.0|The only Apple product I've owned was an iPod video back in 2006 so don't call me a fanboy. I found this book to be a great balance between emotional and historical. Shows a side of Steve Jobs no one ever could even fathom and great historical insight to how Apple was founded as well as a civil war of sorts within the company.<br /><br />Highly recommend it although it is a bit of short read.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game is fun got when your bored. There are tons of different ones. It's good for a challenge. It keeps you busy tor a while.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I still love her writing style. She paints a clear picture and has a great way of getting her point across. It never goes the way<br />I think it will. I'm surprised thought out the entire book. Always thinking in the back of my mind what's gonna happen next.
B001W2JWWC|5.0|Always been one of my favorite albums, yes I said albums, one of the classic rock from the 80's a must have.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Grandson just loved it and plays it all of the time.  It is an educational game to me for little ones.
B0001AP13A|2.0|I'm really disappointed. I love Kanye West, and I wanted to have his first album on vinyl.<br /><br />My dad ordered the album for me for Christmas, and side A of record one was skipping. He exchanged it for me, but now side B of record one is skipping. I have ordered records from amazon before, and this has not been an issue. So, if you order this in vinyl there is a possibility you will get damaged goods.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|GREAT series!Get it!Wonderful acting,photography,sets...Can't stop watching,it is interrupting my normal sleep patterns!Maggie Smith is superb as always,a nice surprise in an overall stellar cast.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|Great dance moves and Male bodies-The movie had a fair story line and did engage the audience.<br />Impressive the way some actors can change their bodies for certain movies-
B00280LYHS|5.0|This series started off good and kept getting better.  The Last Olympian was a fantastic book to complete it.  There is non-stop action and a pleasant ending that has been long awaited by readers.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Awesome-the CD/DVD was great and we enjoyed listening to it and watching it.<br />It is definitely a must have item.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These guys are GREAT!  If you like classical music and current music these guys are a great fusion.  My two favorite instruments are the piano and strings so their music is a no brainer for me.  Anything they do turns out well.  This album is a must for your collection.  I just wish they would sell their videos on itunes.
B00006FDCD|4.0|Funny  and still scarey.king still the best..How can you get bored with stephen king?? he is still the one to beat in screen writing..
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Fun game! Graphics are good and there are lots of scenes in the game. Lots of fun. Wish it was a little longer.
B008MU8ZNO|4.0|Old school movie, brought back alot memories & laughs, good for a fun family night at the movies. and tyhe dog too LOL....
B00594M53M|3.0|A character study on some not so credible characters. The movie was a look at 4 or 5 characters in Paris that were very loosely connected. Lots of movies asks you to check your skepticism in at the door, and this was no exception. The main two characters were Juliette Binoche playing a divorced single mom who has given up on life and her brother, a former dancer in the Paris vaudeville scene, who has been diagnosed with a terminal heart condition which will require a heart transplant. Neither character was real enough to explore very deeply.<br /><br />Dialogue was good as was the cinematography.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Great movie!!!!!!!!!! The best of them all. I hope there will be another...It's a shame that such a tragedy come's behind this film.....
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I watched the movie Brave with my family and we all really enjoyed it.  Be sure to grab a box of tissues beforehand as there are some tear jerking scenes.  The story is about a queen who is training her daughter into becoming a princess and according to tradition, a prince is selected to marry the princess upon proving himself through competitions.  The princess wants her own freedom to choose and fights with her mother on this.  She symbolically tears her mother out of the family by cutting a tapestry with the family in it and seeks a witch to help her mother change.  Her mother does change, but not her heart, rather she becomes a bear.  The story is a lesson of choosing freedom over tradition.  It is also about a love shared between family members that is unbreakable since Merida instantly regrets what she did to her mother and will go to any lengths to bring her back.  The movie is action packed.  Unlike many of the Disney princess movie, this one lacks on the romantic side, however this only adds to the movies uniqueness.  It is more family based than romantic based.  Very good movie to watch with the family.
B0057VDGNK|5.0|The soundtrack is just as great as the movie. That was a great deal for the soundtrack and movie together.
B00280LYIC|5.0|When I read this book, I couldn't put it down at all. It was AMAZING!! Can't wait till I read the next book.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Drive is really good. Ryan Gosling is great in it and the music in this movie is amazing. Well worth the price.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love this book! It is along the same lines as fifty shades of grey,in regards to sexual content, but it does have an interesting story line also! I would definitely recommend it.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|Bought this as a Xmas gift for my daughter. It was on her Xmas list. She was so happy to get it.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|My wife is a Trekie,  and I have been buying her various series each year for Christmas.  Thank you for getting it to me for Christmas.
B0038M61JQ|5.0|Bought this as a Xmas gift for my husband. He really liked it. His favorite song is Stella by Starlight.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Fantastic, wanting more....<br />It was the perfect ending of a in a imaginative series.<br />For those who wanted Obama again, consider this story as a possible reality.<br />In case you didn't get it, Snow depicted Communism and Coin Socialism. Think about it
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Bought this as a Xmas gift for my son-in-law. This is his favorite TV show to watch. He was really happy to get it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series was fantastic. I really got caught up in the entire story and did not want to stop reading.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Bought this as a Xmas gift for my husband. It is one of his favorite albums. It brings back alot of memories.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I don't really use this app much. It is okay. It is a feature that was available with the kindle and so I thought I would give it a try.
B003L77G06|5.0|Bought this as a Xmas gift for my son-in-law. He was so happy to get it as the show is his favorite.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|These were fantastic books. I really became engaged with the relationship as it bloomed. It was a good read and hard to let it come to and end. I really don't want to see a movie made as I have in my mind how every one should look and casting could ruin the whole thing for me.
B003Y5H574|5.0|Bought this as a Xmas gift for my daughter. She was so happy to receive it. It is such a funny movie.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|thank you for this free game...it is a lot of fun and i find it a little more challenging than the first angry birds...please keep them coming
B009O5CLZY|5.0|when I play this I feel like I am in the game!<br /><br />it is so awesome and super super fun
0817439390|4.0|Great book for folks that want to become real professional photographers. I recommend the read and the instructions provided in the content.
B00AZNEW5G|3.0|This film is about Maya (Jessica Chastain) a potty mouthed CIA operative and her one woman crusade to get Bin Laden. It starts off with 9-11. Maya is a composite character. The CIA is not as dumb as this film portrays. She visits CIA black sites around the world through their revolving door. It appears as if she got all the intelligence on her own. We know this was not the case.<br /><br />In comparison, I must say &#34;Seal Team Six&#34; was a far better film as far as plot. What this film offers is an obsessed Jessica Chastain who borders on insanity. Her character seemed unrealistic at times, but compelling at other times.<br /><br />Much has been made about the politics of this film which I found they took great lengths to be non-controversial. Sometimes facts have a bias to them. There is excessive torture at the beginning of the film. Information is gathered from people that have been tortured, but not necessarily because of it, as there is a disconnect between the two events. The audience is allowed to decide on its effectiveness. Seal Team Six appears late in the film, almost as an afterthought. The other film was superior in presenting the Navy Seals.<br /><br />Obama and Bush aren't mentioned per se. Obama appears speaking in the background on TV. There is a new policy concerning torture that is alluded to, but the details are not given. One remark was, &#34;You don't want to be the one caught holding the dog collar.&#34;<br /><br />There is a reluctance on the part of some to invade the Bin Laden compound due to the WMD/Iraq disaster although no blame is specifically placed.<br /><br />Chastain does an excellent job and is the best aspect of this feature. In an idea world she would have played Maya in &#34;Seal Team Six.&#34; I found the political criticisms unwarranted as was the praise given to this film when &#34;Seal Team Six&#34; was clearly the superior production in presenting the tale. If you haven't caught &#34;Seal Team Six&#34; check it out.<br /><br />Recap: Chastain great. Rest of movie so-so. &#34;Seal Team Six&#34; superior over-all.<br /><br />Parental guidance: F-bombs, no sex, some male prisoner rear nudity./><br />Recap: Chastain great.

B009ANP48G|5.0|After seeing the other Step Up movies, I wasn't sure if I'd like this one. However, I ended up loving it.  To me, the best parts were the dance sequences. In fact, that's the main reason I bought the movie. There are a variety of dance styles that are very enjoyable to watch! I'm very happy with this purchase.
B008220D5K|3.0|In this film Pete (Paul Rudd) and Debbie (Leslie Mann)turn 40 and re-examine their lives. Debbie decides everyone must make changes while Pete hides the fact they are broke. It seems Pete invested his future in the resurgence of Graham Parker.<br /><br />They are clearly a mixed couple as Pete likes classic rock while Debbie prefers Lady Gaga. They also have father issues, one is a stranger (John Lithgow) while the other needs a handout (Albert Brooks). Apatow also brings back his daughters Maude and Iris from &#34;Knocked Up&#34; to be Sadie and Charlotte again. I must say his daughters did a great job as a moody foul mouthed 11 year old and an 8 year old wise beyond her years who says to her sister, &#34;You're no fun since your body got weird.&#34;<br /><br />The humor is never really a side splitter such as when they are talking to each other as their counselor says they should talk to each other:<br /><br />Paul: &#34;When I apologize, that means you'll let it go and won't throw it back at me in the future?&#34;<br />Debbie: &#34;I don't do that and I will continue not to do that.&#34;<br /><br />If you loved Apatow's other work, this one is in line with them: crudely humorous and pretentious masquerading as a meaningful statement on modern relationships.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Leslie Mann). Megan Fox bra/panties and bikini. Maybe as a rental.<br /><br />In case you are watching &#34;Lost&#34; for the first time, this film includes the spoiler ending.
B00A757EFW|2.0|Not too sure about this one.  Pacman isn't as easy to control as computer versions using the up, down and side to side arrows.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This app is awesome and I wish it could cone with the kindle fire he except that it is a little slow starting up. If they could fix it I would update my review to 5 stars and update my we odds. I hope you listen.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This product is a lot of fun.  Very addicting.  Some levels are extremely difficult and would be more fun with more birds.  The small bird that splits into three is virtually useless.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Spoiler alert<br />This book is probably the best of the servers and gives the reader mixed emotions. It is sad when Teresa dies but has a weird ending.
0307730697|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone. The faith and life story of Adam Brown is a benchmark, a height to go for. Eric Blehm has done a superb job and I look forward to reading his other books.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|Someone suggested this book based on other authors I read.  I hadn't read any Nelson DeMille books before but will go back and read the John Corey series from the first book.  A lot of humor and of course mystery.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|There is something about the Harry Potter movies that just draws me in. I like having the entire series so I can go back and forth in the storyline to check facts.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is amazing. Even better than sharp objects, also by this author. You will not guess the ending. Awesome.
0545265355|5.0|Bought this for my niece and she has already read the entire series. Once again, the books are better than the movies and we are eagerly waiting on the second movie.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Absolutely loved Pines! I had no idea the direction it was going, or at least to the extent that it went. Very suspenseful and intriguing, I could not put it down! Still confused on the time frames from actual time versus Pines time, but I can let that go. Excellent read!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I did not think that I was going to like it. It turns out that now I have to read the whole series just to see what happens.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Absolutely loved this movie. Initally I was drawn in by the cast (who are all brilliant), but found myself completely enthralled with the entire film. It's been ages since I've seen a happy ending that made me smile. A++++ film.
B0064NTZKI|4.0|I really enjoyed hearing the story of his life, he's an interesting man. I thought at first that 2 pts may be a little much but it is a story told well & I could have listened longer.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|Awesome movie about Halo 4. Live action movie. good story, great acting, and you get to see Master Chief. Whats not to like.
0061906220|5.0|We all love Pete the cat.  We want to BE Pete the cat.  Pete keeps his cool no matter what happens--a lesson my son(3yrs.) and I can both learn.
B008B8DY2O|4.0|I liked the fact that Shantaram was an unusual story.  It was based on a real life situation, which I felt lent it a certain credibility.  Also I was intrigued by its description of life among the poor as well as those living outside the law in a large Indian city.  As it was a long story I was glad of the comfort of reading it on the Kindle rather than in book form.  I would recommend it to someone who likes reading something just that little bit different.
B008Y73940|5.0|Twists and turns set to some awesome music.  Let's face it, it's really hard not to love Matthew McConaughey.  He's easy on the eyes and ears so he's always easy to watch in a movie.  But sometimes, he's just damn compelling.  He can be so intense in some roles that you can't turn away and this is one of them.  He plays a slick street-smart lawyer who gets played.  Some parts of the film are predictable but the movie overall is so well done and acted that you've still got to like it.  I don't know why I keep being surprised by how just how good Matthew McConaughey is.  With this and A Time to Kill (also a favorite with me), I'm fairly convinced that Matthew McConaughey would have made for a dangerous trial lawyer.  He's so slick and smooth, but intense and good-looking -- seriously deadly combo.<br /><br />Did I mention how much I loved the soundtrack? Also, why does Ryan Phillippe seem to play the same character over and over?
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Excellent real life story of true heroism by an elite group of American warriors. Thank God for men like Marcus and the many other Seals who sacrifice so much in the defense of our country. Totally in awe and indebted beyond words.
B0094K1K42|5.0|I initially did not have any interest in seeing this movie based upon the trailers.  I saw this movie because it was free with Amazon Prime.  This movie is nowhere near as much of a downer, depressing, or sad as indicated by some of the other reviews.  There are depressing and sad moments throughout the movie, but I also found myself laughing at a lot of the lines and situations.  I may have a somewhat dark sense of humor, but how can you not laugh at some of the ridiculous statements and situations in the movie??  There's a lot of tongue in cheek humor to be had from the perspective of the movie viewer.<br /><br />Despite the outrageousness of the characters, I thought this was one of the few movies that rings as being honest, real and relatable with most people's lives.  The movie is filled with people who are leading unhappy and/or boring lives and who don't know it and/or are unable to admit it to themselves or to other people.  But none of them know how to deal with their own unhappiness, might as well as the unhappiness of others.  Surprisingly, it's Mavis who turns out to be the most genuine, real, honest and self-aware character in the movie.<br /><br />And because her character is so completely trashed by so many of the other reviewers, I feel the need to defend Mavis.  She is desperately unhappy and she knows it.  Unlike almost all of the other characters, with the exception of Freehaul, she knows just how unhappy she is even if she can't always admit it out loud.  But unlike the other characters, she DOES admit it out loud and for all to witness.  The scene where she lays all her emotions out to bare at the baby naming ceremony has got to be one of the most honest scenes I've seen in a movie.  I love Charlize Theron, and she owned that scene.  The emotions were so raw and real that it felt like my own nerves had been ripped open for everyone to see.  Mavis is not a hero but she's very real, and to me there's something to be admired in being able to admitthe truth no matter how ugly it is.<br /><br />There are no heroes in this movie.  All of the apparently \\"normal\\" and supposedly well-adjusted people in this movie are just as messed up as she is in their own way, in my opinion.  For instance, what kinds of parents refuse to acknowledge the very real and obvious unhappiness in their daughter even when she tells them that she thinks she is an alcoholic?  What kind of unaware self-obsessed woman thinks that a surefire way to cheer up her husband's ex-high school girlfriend, who she thinks is lonely and confused, would be to invite her to their baby's naming ceremony?  Yes, I'm sure that will cheer her right up and make her feel less lonely and confused.  Seriously, WTF?  I've got more examples.  What kind of messed up fool thinks that it's at all acceptable to invite the woman who had a miscarriage with his baby to his baby's naming ceremony?  Did he forget that she miscarried his child??  Did he also forget that he kissed her when Mavis was confronting him about their alleged feelings for each other?  Pretending something didn't happen doesn't mean that it didn't happen.<br /><br />The people in this movie are messed up, and it's not limited to Mavis.  She's not even the most messed up in the movie, in my opinion.  But there's something very true about this movie, along with the darker humor, that makes me love it.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|I plugged this in and reeled it over to my USB connection on my amateur radio gear. Communications was immediately established and functions were controllable just as they should.<br />One thing I'm looking into is the problems of an audio echo when using the microphone connected to the computer to send the audio to the codec in my radio. Still looking for why it does this and where the problem really is.
B004OZZ624|4.0|Spouse and I both enjoyed this movie. Slow start, but good action later on.  Good overall. Grab the popcorn and drinks.
B004YXE438|5.0|Love the puzzles, love the pictures, love the fact you can keep getting add ons, the only downfall is that all the puzzle pieces are squares.  However, being able to select the puzzle piece amount makes up for it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is by fair the best book I ever read, it really makes you think about life in a different light, I would recommend it to anyone
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|The first time I watched this movie I wasn't sure what I thought about it. It was intense, scary, sad and the ending left me feeling less than great. Subsequent viewings have definitely changed my mind. I love Liam Neeson and a number of the supporting characters are personal favorites of mine. The acting is superb and you really find yourself invested in the well-being of the characters. The ending was heart-breaking and definitely unsatisfying because it ends on a cliffhanger.
B00969PR18|4.0|Very good Free apps.<br />Better then Mapquest but not as good a goggle Maps.<br />A good source for quick directions and travel planning.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|I was really disappointed by this movie. I love all of the previous films, so I watched this expecting to really enjoy it and I hated it. The acting was terrible and I'm not sure who wrote the script.. but holy crap. This flick was a total stinker. The other movies are a guilty pleasure, but this one wasn't worth the time at all. It completely lacked the charm of the other films and the story line was lame. Don't waste your time.
B002OSY2T6|5.0|This crawlie worm thing may look simple, but it really works a charm.  It rolls around whizbanging and it also has a mirror which greatly aids in baby's interest in interacting with the toy.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie made me laugh so hard. I've seen it about a dozen times now and I still haven't gotten tired of it. I was pleasantly surprised by how well the different actors and actresses in this movie can sing! I had no idea and found myself enthralled with Anna Kendrick's voice. Rebel Wilson is funny as always and the rest of the cast filled this out nicely. The movie progresses at a rather quick pace and it certainly doesn't feel like two hours when you watch it. There are plenty of absolutely hilarious one liners that I still laugh. Overall, fun for the whole family. The movie isn't dirty, but does have some foul language and sexual innuendos. There's also a couple of really nasty vomiting scenes hahahah but no nudity or anything of the sort. Check it!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a must have. It offers so much, I still can' t believe it was free.. So many different plans for reading in one year. Even a plan of devotions on parenting. You won't regret downloading this.
B004P7CNE0|4.0|There are a lot of people talking about this movie and it seems like the reviews go from one extreme to the next. I happened to really enjoy this film and found that you certainly have to take it at face value. It's an interesting take on the utopian premise and the acting was all superb. Christian Bale did a fantastic job and watching his character evolve over the course of the movie was highly enjoyable. Give it a shot!
B0099114WO|2.0|I will give this film 2 stars only because Meryl Streep managed to stay \\"luminous\\" during this epic fail of a mature romance/comedy/drama feature film.  This film will most likely have a hard time finding its audience.  There are too many cringe-worthy sexual references and scenes for the older crowd and painfully slow pacing for the younger crowd.  I fit into the middle-aged crowd and let's just say that I would never attempt what Meryl Streep's character attempts to do in a movie theatre.  Awwwwwkward.<br />I had high \\"hopes\\" that this film could be a good \\"spring\\"board for rekindling marital intimacy, but would a couple (in this case, primarily the wife initiates the crash course) really find intimacy once again by racing through the romance part of a marital relationship only to jump right into acting out intimate sexual fantasies - with no comfortable middle ground?  Probably not.
B0036TGSIK|4.0|Absolutely adore this comedy. It was fantastically funny, heart-warming and well acted. I find myself falling in love with Emma Stone the more and more I watch her movies. She is adorable and excellent in this role. I wasn't sure how I felt about it the first time I watched it, but find myself liking it more and more. Definitely 4.5/5 stars
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I rented it twice and wasn't disappointed with the story or acting.  It's a feel-good movie and I like the young actor that played the S.J., the young son.  He was great.
B005MMYCY6|5.0|I LOVED this little movie and JGL was absolutely fantastic. This movie brought me through the full spectrum of human emotion.. from anger to sadness to joy. The characters are all interesting and this movie definitely had a way of making the viewer feel invested in their evolution/progress. The movie was also hilariously funny in so many ways.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|I thought it was pretty good.  The first Expendables was the best, Expendables 2 was good.  Action packed.  I took away a star for too many one-liners for laughs.  Still it was fun to watch.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Overall this movie was really interesting. I found myself confused, horrified, and enthralled by everything going on and I really can't wait for the next installment. As someone who loves the Alien franchise, I found it really cool that this movie kind of explained where those creatures came from. It seems like people go either way with this one. They either absolutely hate it or they really liked it. I happened to really like it. Give it a shot and decide for yourself.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Epic but wheres world tour my friend has it but i dont i would get it no really bad.glitches ya so get it
B002APU580|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. I realize that period flicks and romantic dramas of this sort are not for everyone. I myself typically do not like this kind of movie. With that being said, I love everything about this film. The music is stunning, the lighting is artful, and the nuance in the flick is absolutely fantastic. I found myself really connecting with the actors and I think all of the roles were filled beautifully. Definitely worth the price!
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book is highly technical but since I have a science and healthcare background it helped me to understand the theory behind the premise. When I started Atkins in 2012 many of my wheat related symptoms disappeared but not all, now I know why and plan on becoming wheat free in 2013.
B000NGTJTY|2.0|This movie had the potential to be really, really good.. but the director failed to deliver. Whoever wrote the script needs to kick themselves in the nuts. Honestly. I think people like this just because of the big names associated with it, but I really feel like this was a big flop. For one thing, *spoilers* I feel as though the ending was ridiculous. Nearly everyone dies within a 5 minute period. It felt like they kind of just went, \\"well.. this movie is getting too long so lets just kill everyone off to wrap it up\\". This is the first movie I have ever walked out on. Awful! I hated it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I cannot seem to stop playing this. I may soon need an intervention. Seriously though, this is a great little app. The timed play makes for great replayability.
B005LAII12|1.0|Ted is about a teddy bear coming to life and when he is older he drinks, does drugs and swears.  I watched half of this and stopped it.  If I could return it for something good I would.
B001IF252M|5.0|I bought this to display my macbook on my Sony Bravio TV.  Works great and is priced reasonably.  You must also have an RCA cable for audio.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I enjoyed this movie, it was interesting and I found myself wishing for more. You need to watch the whole movie to get the complete picture.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is a rollercoaster of twists and turns and Gore but very good,I am sad it's the end and excited to see the movies for 2 and 3
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham is always a winner especially when traveling. This was no exception. Held my attention but did seem to leave more for the end rather than revealing through out falling action.  I do recommend it as quite entertaining none the less.
B0076DELIG|4.0|If you are a Bosch fan, you won't want to miss this blast to the past. The mystery will keep you reading to the end.
B005HSL626|5.0|Fun but simple game keeps my kids entertained for hours Thank you Amazon for a wonderful game Keep the good stuff coming
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I could not put the book down. It took it to work and stay up late reading it. I read all three books in two weeks. With a family to take care of and work full time, it takes me much longer. I love books that give lots of details and keeps you interested from beginning to end.  It has its dark  and romantic side to it and is what they called mommy porn. This book can also, give up ideas for your own love life in giving you a boost to try something new.
B004XD03RK|5.0|I still love this cd to this day. This was Death's cd that will stand the test of time. Good stuff!

0525953728|5.0|I thought this book was extremely well written for anyone to read. It guides the reader through the journey of this brave seal who risked his life numerous times for the greater American good.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Love this CD.  Full of fun music.  Hope to get more from this artist in the near future. Kind of similar in style to Michael Jackson.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great entertainment, educational, beautifully written, and a beautiful story.  None of the ridiculous sex, foul language, car chases, and violence that american films and Television  call entertaining.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book and I couldn't put it down. It was so addicting to the point I read it every chance I got
B00628RVV0|5.0|dont want to spoil it but truly ironic. i wish there would have been a  more extended ending, it just kind of ends.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Even better than the 1st! A turkey unique story. I could barley put it down. Looking forward to reading the 3rd!
B008602KQI|5.0|I've read the book and loved it. I had very high expectations for the movie and is did NOT disappoint. Jennifer Lawrence was stunning as Katniss, managing to keep the audience's attention even when it was just her on screen. There's just something about her that's so...perfect. She held the entire movie on her shoulders and made it all the better for it. Josh Hutcherson was a very good Peeta. His internal debate on the morals of killing definetly shown through and resonated with me. The whole cast was amazing, but several shown through. Woody Harrelson was a great Haymitch, Willow Shields and Amandla Stenberg gave their respective roles of Prim and Rue a great deal of venerability. Isabelle Fuhrman was a viscous Clove and Stanley Tucci was the ultimate scene-stealer as the Game's announcer, Caesar Flickerman. The special effects were...lacking. Some of them, like the Capitol, were breathtaking. But others, like the flaming dresses, were simply too fake looking. I loved the way that the world-building happened. We saw three very different places, the Capitol, the arena, and District 12, and got a good feel for all of them. But my albsolute favorite part was that it kept the themes and essence of the book intact, and expanded on them. As we watch the violence, we aren't listening to epic music, or witty one-liners, or watching the main characters smiling after kills(well, except for some villains). No, we see screams and blood and knives and terror and fear. We, as an audience, realize that we are no better than the Capitol citizens eagerly awaiting bloodshed. And we wonder...what would we do if we were a tribute? The Hunger Games poses many questions and morals that are continued to be explored in the three sequels that will hit theaters in the next three years. I cannot wait!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved it! Wasn't ready for it to end! I would have enjoyed an epilogue though! I would highly recommend it to anyone!
B00007E7K0|5.0|This product is exactly as advertised. A replacement Canon lens cap. Shipping was prompt. The cap arrived in a Canon brand package. Works the same as the original lens I lost.
B00181JGI2|2.0|This movie only makes sense if you are stoned.  A friend who really likes this movie told me that you need to drink a white Russian every time the Dude does......Sorry, this movie was a bust for me.
B00009NHC5|5.0|I'd never seen this movie until a friend let me borrow it. What a well done movie! I bought it for my mom one xmas and she'd seen it when she was younger but always wanted it in her collection.
146500632X|5.0|my 14yr old granddaughter loves it.  She has some of their music and videos and this calendar is an excellent addition to collection fan items.
B00A2IUHM6|5.0|From the creator of Family Guy, American Dad, and Cleveland Show comes a movie that not only lives up to those great shows but surpasses them in my opinion. If you are a fan of any of those shows you'll love this movie. I saw this movie in the theater and knew I was going to get it on Blu-Ray, and I have watched it at least 5 times. It is a laugh a minute with Patrick Stewart narrating occasionally, with nothing but hilarious things to say. If you pay attention or know Seth McFarlane's work you'll notice a lot of familiar voices, and of course a great cameo by Sam Jones (Flash Gordon) as himself. My favorite seen has to be the discussion between Mark Wahlberg and Patrick Warburton about his black eye. This one goes in my Classic comedy section which includes Blazzing Saddles,  Spaceballs, Three Amigos, The Other Guys, Cop Out, Christmas Vacation, Animal House, The Hangover, Superbad, Role Models, and Harold and Kumar: escape from  guantanamo bay to name a few. Great movie, and I hope there are more to come from Seth.
B000OIZSVY|5.0|This was my first experiment with giving the gift of a Kindle book.  My wife downloaded it flawlessly, and has been laughing out loud ever since.  She's a grammar geek who has found her mentor and role model.  Highly recommend if you know anyone with grammar in their blood!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Before you know it, this app will keep you occupied half the night.  Very addicting!  This puzzle is the easiest to learn, yet it will keep you thinking all night.  That's after you quit playing.  You have to connect the color dots with the same color dots.  The game starts with a box divided into smaller boxes.  Depending on the number of colored pairs of balls you have, the boxes on the playing surface get smaller and increase in count.<br /><br />You draw with a finger(or stylus) from one ball to another of the same color.  The puzzle is done when you have connected all the pairs and passed through every box on the playing surface without crossing another line. Sounds easy, what's so difficult about that?  Well, let's just say the starter puzzles are just that, something to start you off with.<br /><br />They start off real easy, then get tougher as you go.  But watch out on the easier one's, pay attention because they teach you how to defeat the harder puzzles. The object is to end up with all puzzles solved perfectly.  Each puzzle has a solution, or more.  You want to find the easiest one available.  If there are 7 pairs of colored balls, then you want to solve it in 7 moves.  As the puzzles get solved, you get bigger boxes with more colors to connect. In the beginning, once you have connected all the pairs correctly, then all the boxes have been drawn through.  Latter, after all the balls are connected there are a lot of open squares.  The game tells you to keep playing, you have to go back and find a way to connect the pairs while drawing through every box.<br /><br />You can check your progress with the game square counters seen when you first start.  As you complete each individual puzzle, the numbers in the counter box(can't think of better name at the moment)will have either a check mark or a star for that game.  A star is for completing the puzzle perfectly, and the check mark indicates you finished it.  Once you have completed all the individual puzzles, you want to have nothing but stars in you game counter.  Good Luck, it will be fun!<br /><br />PS: The game comes with five packs of puzzles.  Once you solve them all and you still want to play, the developers sell more game packs.  My only complaint was that I went through all the puzzles and I want more.  So I guess I need to buy some.  If this isn't challenging enough, may I also suggest Flow Free Bridges.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have to say I liked the 3rd book better than books 1 and 2.  I'm going to miss these characters.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I downloaded this app for my two daighters and I. At first the game is really cute and lots of fun. however if your kids are young like mine are make sure you have parental controls so they cant accidentally buy gems on your credit card. Next I would like to point out that a lot of the ponies including rairity and rainbowdash cost real money. In fact a few of the quests will not let you proceed. to the next quest until you have bought the item they are looking for. after calculating just a couple of the things you need to get in order to finish the game you will have spent at least 60 dollars and that is without a lot of the ponies and buildings. the worst part for me is that I don't want to spend that much money and now both of my kids are upset that they cant finish the game and they cant get the ponies they want. this game is NOT FREE. and it is very disappointing.  I would not recommend this game. :(
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|It has excellent video and sound quality. This trilogy+1 will go down as one of the classics for all time. The +1 was a movie that did not need to be made as I felt that Harrison was going through the motions to get the scenes shot. But the original 3 are a delite to watch and enjoy over and over again.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love all the diary of a wimpy kid books and i hope you keep making more!!!! I rate this five stars
B005HSG3TC|3.0|I expected a little more for the price of this case. It's nothing special, just a cover that only has one position for viewing. It doesn't even have an area to store a stylus. Looks durable. It's okay, but I wouldn't have paid this much for it had I know prior. I bought one for my new Kindle Fire HD for less with 3 viewing positions, a stylus pen holder and an auto shut off cover for less.
B0042C1BP0|5.0|Bond movies seem very hit and miss to me.  While I am not a huge fan I do always enjoy a good action/spy movie and the Bond series has always been the go-to films to scratch that itch.  At first I was apprehensive of the new Bond (Daniel Craig) but quickly overcame my reservations as the film progressed.  I do like that this version is a bit more human and has a more believable past, and that the sometimes absurd techno-gadgets have been scaled back a bit.  A more learned Bond fan or a film critic can give the more detailed blow-by-blows but as a regular guy who likes 007 I definitely found Casino Royale to be a pretty damn good movie.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Talk about fun and exiting read this book and you will just love it is full of it (: really you will thank you for reading this
B004WR125O|4.0|Pretty straightforward.  You want wireless on your Onkyo unit, so you get this dongle.  It seems to be made decently, works like it should, and the only downside is my USB slot is taken on the front, but oh well.  I did reduce by one star because it seems to take a bit to connect to your network.  It's not a deal-breaker but it gets kind of tiring waiting for it to initialize only to have to wait while it connects to your services.  I know, I know First World Problems.  Good dongle though, I recommend it.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|i love this game. it is almost like cut the rope. if u like playing cut the rope and cut the rope experiments, you will definitely love and adore pudding monsters.

B008PE9GSA|4.0|The best ZZ-TOP disc in several years.<br /><br />It live up to all my expectations. Billy Gibbons plays the blues<br />and rock with great feelings.<br /><br />I will recomend this disc fo all lovers of ZZ-Top.
B008N1V11U|5.0|Great story and legendary special affects.  I loved the way they ended it.  Anne Hathaway was a awesome character.<br />Thank you, RAM
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love it  like it  it is awesome I want more gooD game it is fun every one should play it
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I found that the built in flash on my D-40x wasn't quite bright enough for larger rooms.  This flash was fairly inexpensive, and has yielded great indoor pictures.  It is compact, and adjustable.  You can tilt the flash to soften it by bouncing light off the ceilings.  Overall, a great product at a good price.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This app is pretty much the best dragon raising app out there.  It's too awesome for words.  Thank you Backflip studios!
B00846F1YW|4.0|I bought this game because I like hidden object games that provide a challenge and this is one of those games from Nevosoft .
B008OOYALE|5.0|Great game for raising dragons!  The cool thing is that you can invite other parks to be your neighbors. Team Lava has done it again!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Excellent movie, Ridley Scott does it again by keeping you rivited to your seat. Sometimes it's best to just leave some unanswered questions alone.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read the first WOOL...and immediately had to the read the next 4! They are so well written and keep you completely hooked from beginning to end!<br /><br />Even though the first WOOL is a short story, you become attached to the characters, and want more and more. I absolutely loved every second, and only wish that I hadn't read them so quickly! Definitely don't think twice about reading this series: amazing!
B000FVE3BG|3.0|dear sir,<br /><br />i like you design for this watch but when i check details for this watch it's size 450 mm but when i received i found it 50 mm it's very big one my hand because of this i sell it to my  friend, but really i like the design and color.<br /><br />best regards,,<br /><br />Mahmoud Anwar
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I´v never cried about a b book before but I did ,it is the most beautiful book I will ever read
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a roller coaster ride this book takes you on. The story is captivating and heart wrenching. An amazing story of love, loss, and confusion. I felt the emotions throughout the book and enjoyed every word of it. This is a must read to people who enjoy any genre of book. I definitely see this one becoming a movie!!!
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Into the Darkest Corner had all the makings of a hard to put down thriller. You were kept guessing until the conclusion.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|I bought this movie for my niece for Christmas. She has autism and we have been introducing the Princesses to her. She is learning all of them very well. She loves Belle, so we knew she would love the movie.
0375869026|5.0|This is an excellent book for all ages from 10 up! Kids will relate, adults will reflect. It is amazing that this is the first book of this author. Sensitive, stirring account that makes us all think about what &#34;being different&#34; really means and shows the generosity of youth and love.
B005LAII08|5.0|I bought this movie for my daughter for Christmas to add to our Disney collection. She is a red headed, green eyed girl who thought Meridia was amazing. Very cute movie for the entire family to watch.
B004Z7AI4W|5.0|My six-year-old granddaughter loves this movie and has asked for all the other Wimpy Kids movies. They have all been great fun.
B005COO1X6|4.0|The book was well written. I enjoyed it very much as I have always enjoyed Stephen King 's marvelous work.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another great book from a great author. Read it in 3 days. Ending is a BIG surprise. Just simply, wonderful.
B00355L2TU|5.0|A speedy and challenging workout which gets good results fast. She explains the exercises well and they are actually easy to do even for someone who's fairly uncoordinated. Fun workout. Would definintely recommend it!
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Enjoyed this book . Would recommend to friends as was recommended to me.Had good solid story and a bit of every thing. Showed real life values.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Such an amazing movie. Hilarious and fast-paced, never a dull moment. Doesn't hurt that the characters are cast well, for the most part, and good-looking too. The chemistry between the cast playing the Bellas shines through, and makes the characters even more endearing to the audience. Anna Kendrick is great as the badass DJ hiding her dorky side, Rebel Wilson is completely hilarious, and Brittany Snow is absolutely fantastic as the girl lacking boundaries who you can't help but fall in love with. The music is undeniably catchy and well put together (I bought the soundtrack), and lesbihonest, the movie is full of lines to be quoted over and over again. This is a movie I will watch over and over again.
B008HT4FUW|4.0|you have to guess what disc has what  there is no info printed on the discs ad far as episodes, the special additional content is printed on the disc. strange. the pic quality is great
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Christmas gift, and it was a hit!  Great condition and good price. Haven't watched them yet, but we've seen them many times!
034580404X|2.0|I think most of what you can say about these books has been said and while I agree with both sides (worst book ever and not too bad) I  have to say I am in the middle  on this one.<br /><br />I finished the Trilogy, because I dont like stopping a book/series no matter how bad it gets. I think the author had some good ideas in the book - like the Helicopter crash/gunman - but didnt know how to develop the story line in a meaningful way.<br /><br />The characters are somewhat unrealistic  - a multi-millionair at 27 that spends all day with his love-interest - not to mention tthat he is super-controlling and does not check up on her birth control?  Really! And while I can believe that Ana  is very naive, shy and inexpeireinced in the beginning, it  gets on your nerves by the end of the books, because she does not really grow at all. The inner godess is frustrating and the best part of the series are the email exchanges between the two of them.<br /><br />The sex scenes are interesting the first couple of times and than it's like - really!?! I mean a day is like this - wake up, sex, shower, sex while in the shower, getting out of shower-sex, trying to get dressed - more sex, after breakfast sex ....well you get the picture. It's like I said above - a super successful business man and he just  drops everything and does not care about anything but her. I think you could have cut the sex scenes by like 90% and still had plenty in there, but more time to actually develop the story/characters better.<br /><br />And than his staff - they have to clean the \\"toys\\" and know what he does and still feel like he is the \\"best person ever\\"! I understand that people have issues and are not \\"evil\\" by any means, but I think Christians issues got resolved rather quickly - since actually the first book doesnt cover more than what - like 2month tops.<br /><br />The reason I gave the series 2 stars, is because there good parts in the books, like the email exchanges, which I found entertaining and I laughed a couple of times , while I read the book. But overall I don't think it deserves more than those 2 stars.
B005V20JKI|5.0|Got this as a free app of the day. It's the only one I keep going back to, even months later.<br /><br />Controls could be better, but that is a limitation of touchscreens, not the app
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is fantastic!! Perfect for what I need it for. I have looked at different ones but this is exactly what I needed.

0736092269|5.0|This book is a MUST HAVE for Personal Trainers, as well as those getting in shape.  The book is VERY informative, yet simple to understand.  It includes all the basic exercises for each part of the body, as well as VERY descriptive pictures of the EXACT muscles getting worked.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is really sad like I'm serious when I got to the part where prim dies I cried and then there's o<br />Always a happy ending and that's what makes the book so good!!!!!! I love this book! :) <3

B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I rated this 1 star because when you type in your email password it does not want to take it. I checked my email password a million times and it said I would not take it. Hopefully if u download this game they will have that fixed
B00007E7K0|5.0|Clipped onto a Canon Rebel EOS Digital just fine, and served as a good replacement for the original cap my wife lost :)!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I rated this book a five because I'm the type of kid that loves to read action packed adventures I'm s o glad that I read it at first before I read it I was all like this book was going to suck but it turned out to be really awesome.
0062206281|5.0|Another stunner...I've had to learn patience waiting for his next book to come out. Hurry up; they're all marvelous and so vivid; you're so wrapped up in the history and magic of the time that you really feel like you're there!!.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game I have ever played! :3 I had the free version on my iPod touch and loved it! So when I got  kindle fire I immediately bought it !
B00466HN72|5.0|I laughed almost to tears, such a funny movie. It is a nice children's movie. It is also good for adults.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book had me hooked from the first pages. I stayed up all night reading I couldn't put it down. I felt like the main character became my best friend I knew her so well she reminded me of me.
1612680011|4.0|great book, it is a must read if you want to understand, a new way of thinking to make your life better
B00A9X7X6C|5.0|Visually arresting cinematography, exceptional cast of actors and a storyline that remains gripping throughout the entire film. Recommend very highly!
B0009P66TK|1.0|The watch looks great. The watch face is so big. The face is so big it will cover you whole wrist. If you like people to notice you this Watch is for you.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|Great show! Watched all 6 seasons. Once you start you don't want to stop! Young version of SATC. Hate it had to end.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|liked it alot...  only fear was that my 2 year old would start to develop telekinesis...  I am going to have to invest in a safe.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What an amazing book. Can't wait for the movie to bring it to life.  Perfect ending and point of view from his side.
0394527771|5.0|Book arrived quickly and in condition as stated. Very happy with my purchase. Only problem is that my dad took my book to read before I could as he has been wanting to read it!!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I love this set. benn looking for a while. I'm a big Indiana Jones fan. Good to sit down and watch on a rainy day.
B008QI6EHQ|4.0|Excellant autobiography from one of fanatic dectector.<br />It is really astonishing to go into fepth of this formifable perdonality who may be theat to worlf but best rilet for his fatherland.
B005LAIISU|3.0|This completed the ste. I still think the 1st one is best ( as usual). Although, it was good. Hope there will be another.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I will be impatiently waiting for the next book!!!!!! Such a good read! It kept me on my feet the whole time.
0446554995|2.0|This is the first Pendergast book I have read, and I have to say I was lost through most of it.  I did not know it was a continuing series and not a stand-alone book.  As others have said, there are three stories in this tale, one of which wasn't necessary, had nothing to do with the main story, and detracted from the main story.  Characters apparently have been in previous books, but having never read them, I was constantly wondering who the heck they were.  I doubt I will read another unless it falls in my lap.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Good book could not put it down for long. Can not wait to read the next book in the series.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|this device works very well<br />it can charge an IPod touch 5 many times on one charge<br />it can also charge two at the same time<br />well worth it!
0385732554|4.0|Recommended by a friend, I enjoyed this philosophical book,  akthough I found the ending puzzeling.  The idea of a utopia with no problems caused many problems was intersting.  It is not a must read, but an interesting read just the same.
B001F67KOM|4.0|Clever and funny movie on multiple levels with a little bit of a hokey love story built in.  Not so much a family move though. 17+
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|If you like the type of humor used in the show Family Guy, you will really like this movie as well.
B002NF1ZI6|5.0|These legos help with building buildings. There are a lot of them also--mainly a castle builder. so here are 4 more.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|It truly secures my kindle. I don't fear dropping it as much as I used to. This is a great product!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Really can not complain the fifty shades trilogy still has my hold. It is kinda like the twilight saga, no vampires or werewolves.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Great movie. Original in a familiar way and very funny. You'll be laughing and pulling for the team the entire time. I recommend for everyone!
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Babel shares with us yet another level to the incredible musicianship of Mumford and Sons.  The vocals are quite haunting. This is a must listen regardless of your preferred musical taste.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|This thing is great, the fact that it works as a &#34;Rock Band&#34; or &#34;Guitar Hero&#34; version for classic piano pieces is amazing. Here with different levels of expertise you can test your ability and learn new pieces, and the best part without a doubt is that it is free. if you are learning piano, or want to just get immerse yourself in the world of classic masterpieces, give this thing a good try.
B0099114WO|5.0|tommy lee jones and meryl streep give strong performances!  it is a very funny movie!  i recommend it for fans of both!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Just like the title says, this app is amazing! Love the large buttons and that the calculator fills up the entire screen. Very easy to use
B0062QRTKA|2.0|Let me preface my original review by asking why, exactly, do I need to unlock the levels when I paid for the game? It's a hard game, so while I try a few times for a perfect score, sometimes I end up with 1 or 2 stars. So now, halfway through the game I'm stuck! I can't progress without more stars and I resent being forced to replay levels in a paid game. As long as you pass a level you should go onto the next no matter 1 or 3 stars. Makes me want to just uninstall.<br /><br />It's a fun, original game with great graphics, appropriate music and a sense of humor. While I like it, I don't really love it. The reason is that it's so chaotic, and everything happens so fast, so I don't usually feel like 'wow, I killed that!' After a level. I'm a perfectionist, and for me there is no hope of perfecting this one. If I try it will suck all the fun out of it. I enjoy it when I play, but I don't feel like I'm dying to get back to it. If you're wondering which games I can't wait to play, some of them are Sleepwalker's Journey, Contre Jour, Draw A Stickman Epic and Naught. (compare google play prices :)
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I just finished the book and really got caught up in the characters and the horrors of WW II.  Although some of it was<br />difficult to read especially the atrocities committed by the Nazis and Stalin, it's a realistic portrayal of the war and the<br />effects it had on Europe and it's people.  Although the book ends in 1946, we know the story of Russia and how they<br />ruled Eastern Europe for decades after the war ended..<br />Ken Follett certainly researches his books, and I look forward to the next and final book of the Century trilogy.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|i was having trouble with internal storage a someone recommended this to me and it solved my problem immediately on file was taking up 4.8 GB it was ridiculous!
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|This is a feel good movie that I consider to be an &#34;oldie&#34;, but a &#34;goodie&#34;.  If you're into older movies, this is a must own.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Had to keep buying chances to continue to play. Didn't want to buy item to play after you. Use free ones
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game and it is my favorite card game - it helps me to relax and win on my own terms and conditions
037582913X|5.0|my Grand daughter has had me read it somany times that she now can read it to herself and any one else who will listen,
1572816112|5.0|I was so pleased to receive these cards.  I did some research and wanted unique cards.  These really speak to you on a deeper level.  I really appreciate how the artist creates his images too!  Beautifully packaged as well!
0394800184|4.0|when my children were little I read this to them. Now I can read it to all the little people in my life.  It always makes me smile
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I wasn't a big fan of Bared to You but I had to read the next book to see what happened. Reflected in You is captivating and it took a turn I didn't expect. I'm glad I read this one!
B00785P2QC|5.0|this a perfect game for me and the game is just cool. I hope you make another game like this
B009WJ1DNS|5.0|This album is tied with Lacuna Coil's previous work (In A Reverie) as being their very best work. There is not one bad song that I have listened to on this album. The mood that each song resonates feels very unique in comparison to other artists and bands of this genre. This mood is thanks in no small part to the two vocalists Cristina and Andrea. Cristina's beautiful (one could even say angelic) voice is complimented nicely with Andrea's more harsh vocals. While Andrea's work in Unleashed Memories was a little stronger, he does a fine job in Comalies. Overall, fans of the goth metal genre should definitely take notice of this album and band if they haven't already.<br /><br />Personal favorite songs:<br /><br />. Swamped<br />. Aeon/Tight Rope<br />. The Ghost Woman and the Hunter<br />. Entwined
B009G5TWFO|5.0|I love this movie. I really enjoy the battle scenes and the queen is an awesome character. Definitely happy I bought it.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Very fun and enjoyable game to play. It is continuous and never gets you bored. I recommend for anyone, even adults.
B0091REZMW|5.0|amazing :) is a nice and neat game I also love how you have to recharge the bar to get to a harder level
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is both heart breaking and breath taking it has so much power to it you feel like your in the book itself I would recommend this for anyone trying to find a great book to read.
B007XC9BSK|2.0|Case size disappointing for the price.  Much smaller than expected. Since it doesn&#34;t include any cars I had to order some separately which made total gift too pricey.  What fun is it to open a gift with a storage case that has no cars to test it with.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|The book was very well thought out but with the style of writing I never really felt like I was getting into each storyline.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I am having a lot of fun with this game.  I have been trying different strategies to win but haven't been successful, yet!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was the best book I've ever read.I'm definitely going to read it again, and tell all my friends about it
B004DM0UII|2.0|I gave XiiaLive Pro a shot despite not being happy about requiring access to my contacts,  etc. Unfortunately, the app just isn't very good. The UI is simple and easy to use, but it's extremely limited. Not only does it have just a fraction of the amount of stations that are available on free apps like Tune-In, I couldn't find a single one of my favorite streaming stations. There is no search or sort option by location either.  This app appears to be nothing more than a Shoutcast shell. There are much better free online radio apps available.  Uninstalled.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Really good book. I could imagine every character and felt like I was there. Definitely will recommend this boom and I want to see the movie.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Read whole series in a couple of days - can't wait for all the movies to come out.  Highly recommend.
B007QPFGJW|3.0|It was okay. Too many details to keep track of during the reading.<br />It wasn't my favorite book to read.
B00866H7SS|1.0|Really disappointed with this novel; pretty much a direct copy of 50 shades.  Won't be reading any more of Sylvia Day's work.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|amusing but not too hard.  would play again or download more from the same company.  great time killer.  well done for a free game
B005EGXTL2|5.0|Read whole series in a couple of days - can't wait for all the movies to come out.  Highly recommend.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Easy Read. Great story with great characters. Ending is totally unexpected. Definitely learned the true definition to a Racketeer. Well worth the read.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I've always known a spiritual world exists in, around and above this earthly world.  What I found intriguing were the details ... phenomenal!  Especially from someone who spent so much time prior to his experience denying it's very existence.  Highly recommend for believers AND non-believers.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|Too much violence and mutilation. I can't comment on the story', I didn't watch very much of the flick nnn
B001R10BM8|5.0|This is the James Bond movie that is missing from the 30 year set, they claim it was not part of the series!<br />Any True James Bond Fan will want to have this movie also!!
B008LV8TSU|5.0|A delightful experience to read this book. Very imaginative and original. I recommend it fully! I want to see the movie, but I don't think it could be better than the book
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Very Cute, makes you think. Kids love it, and adults find it harder than it appears. Lots of fun for the whole family. Non-Violent.
B00867GJYK|5.0|Loved the film, but was not so impressed by the special features. I doubt many are buying this for the extras, so I think its a great buy
0525951652|5.0|The book Fall of Giants was written in a way that drew you into the story. You could see the characters in your mind.<br />Since I love History so much the book exspanded my knowledge of the world. It connects events like  links in a chain.<br />For History buffs, I would recommend it. Of course you might not want to put it down. A friend who is 87 recommended the book to me. He had it read from cover to cover in two days.<br />Get the book and enjoy<br />Gene F. Danforth
B0058EJJSM|5.0|This is a hard to find album. Wonderful album. Just as I remembered it. Not available on iTunes. Thanks for making it available.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My kids bought this game and asked me for help on some of the levels. That was all it took to get me hooked!!
B008OOYALE|4.0|its an awesome and fun game. i have few other story games on my kindle. but here this evening 1-5-13 it kept saying i have no net connection an to try again. even though i had connection it wasnt working properly. so decided to re install it and see if it works again. also if anyone reads this add me AllysMama2011
B004W1GCNC|5.0|A typically well done British production. Very well acted and produced. Just wish the BBC continued support for this series.
B00A5IYXY6|4.0|Le Havre is a good film for intellectuals with a slightly weak ending. The visual aspects are superb. The acting is good.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I don't read a lot of mysteries because I find they get very repetitive and predictable. This book was neither of these! It caught my attention from the beginning and kept me page turning into the night. I can't wait to try other books by this author. Great read!
B000HT3PPG|5.0|The transfer is clean. It showed really well on my home theater system. Not to boast, it showed well on 120&#34;. You'll want to watch the opening with great street level views of older NYC.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is beautifully done, the puzzles are challenging, varied and well balanced with hints if a solution is elusive. I highly recommend Quell and Quell Reflect.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I refuse to watch the movies, my visuals of these books are perfect from Larsson's intricate descriptions and attention to detail. He goes so far as to correctly name pieces of IKEA furniture. He's amazing. Read the damn books before you watch the movies.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|I was hoping this search board would help make playing games on kindle fire easier on facebook.  You cannot use flash player even if enabled on kf  disapointed with my  kindle,  Kindle does not make it easy to update either, sad sad sad
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Whatever goes into Starbucks coffee that makes people spend $4 a cup, they extracted and put into Martin's storytelling. The books are long, the stories are complicated, the constant narration swapping gets confusing, but you can't. stop. reading. it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This card game is quick and easy to play. It is fairly easy to catch on to even for a person such as myself.......not game or electronic savy. I play the game when I just need a few minutes to wind down at the end of the day.  R
B004G600A4|5.0|I got this as a gift for my room mate. She was thrilled to get this movie. The product may be used but is still in excellent condition.
0793518326|5.0|It's just perfect. It has everything you'd want to know about any Beatles song, including the covers.<br />I recommend it!
B0016MZFXS|3.0|its pretty tiny for the price, and it beeps every hour but the time is projected only when u click demo.
0634022296|4.0|This item met almost all my expectations: it's a practical book for playing and singing any of the Beatles songs.<br />The only bad thing is that it doesn't have the songs played by the Beatles as a cover.<br /><br />It's a very good book, though.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless was hopelessly addicting. Colleen Hoover is adept at creating realistic characters with dimension, and you are pulled into their lives one page at a time. If you enjoyed Slammed and Point of Retreat, you will not be disappointed by Hopeless. The relationship between these characters is more mature, so I definitely don't recommend the book for the under-18 crowd. (It's not erotic, it's just a tad deeper and more explicit than her earlier mentioned books.)<br /><br />This is a great story that drew me in from the first chapter. I read it Christmas weekend and could hardly put my Kindle down until I'd reached the end. Great work, Colleen!
B008673ZAQ|2.0|My first issue is the marketing of the book. It is described as \\"scorching\\" and erotica, but it is really a romance novel focusing on the character's emotional tribulations. Don't pick it up expecting something hot and thrilling! You'll be well into the book before you get anything beyond a reference to a hook-up. The focus is largely on the character's feelings, emotions, and blah blah blah relationship issues. The book is mired in endless he-said she-said communication pitfalls.<br /><br />Furthermore, I couldn't get past how annoying I found the main characters, Gideon and Eva, to be. I tried reading it twice; each time, I wanted to smack them both off the page because they were so irritating. Each had a high maintenance, condescending attitude that was obnoxious and off-putting. At the same time, they seemed completely one-dimensional and not believable at all, as if they were paper cut-outs going through the author's routine dialog. Strangely enough, the supporting characters (Eva's roommate and boss) are the ones who are sympathetic and the sources of good dialog.<br /><br />Finally, the author falls into the old writing trap of telling, not showing. There are endless odes to how attractive Gideon is and how much Eva loves him, but I couldn't really form an image of either of them in my mind. Other than finding them annoying, I couldn't picture them in my mind.<br /><br />For the 10$ I spent on the book, I should have gone to a coffee shop a few times and re-read 50 Shades Of Grey.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Once I started reading this I could not put it down. The remarkable journey this woman faced is beyond tragic. Her views and ways of coping are unbelievable. I commend her strength to share her story and most intimate thoughts. Her recovery and strength is truly inspiring. A must read but only for mature readers.
B004QX07G4|2.0|I love Ellen but sorta feel this was too easy and maybe just rushed through for the money or a deadline. Sorry... if I'm wrong E, just send me a couple of plane tickets and we can discuss it.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Got what I paid for. She loves it. Even though its missing the advertised song its still a hit .
B0097EWK3A|5.0|very entertaining. great plot and keeps you on your toes! can't wait for the second part! was definitely. worth the small price.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I always enjoy Vince Flynn's Mitch Rapp books.  This one did not disappoint.  I like that we are back to the present time.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|No funny in the least, unless you think the shock value of 4 letter words and raunchiness is funny.  Don't bother.
0345472322|3.0|Mindset was highly recommended by a good friend of mine. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in the book. Not by how it is written... it is pretty well written and contains lots of short stories to make the message of the author concrete. Yet, the message feels a bit simplistic to me, a bit too black/white and that same message was repeated over and over again.<br /><br />\\"Mindset\\" suggests that there are two types of mindsets: a fixed one and a growth mindset. For most people, one of these mindsets is the strongest and it will influence how they see their life and how they react to events. Fixed mindset people believe that people are the way they are and won't change. Therefore failure will be seen as an failure of themselves and react defensively. People with a growth mindset believe people change and learn and failure will be seen as an opportunity for improving...<br /><br />The book contains 8 chapters. Some are pretty good, some are, in my opinion, rather poor. The first three chapters sort-of contain the basic message, the introduction of the mindsets and how they change the meaning of failure and effort. It also talks about how these mindsets get created in the environment of people, which is one of the most interesting aspects of the book. One of the most insightful parts of the book relate to the effect of praising children and how that can have a negative effect. I'd recommend everyone to read the first three chapters and then perhaps stop or switch to the last chapter.<br /><br />Chapter 4 to 6 contain examples and effects of the two mindsets in three different environments: 4) sports, 5) business, and 6) relationships. These chapters mainly contain stories which the author uses to contrast the two mindsets to each other and to show how people act and react differently based on the different mindsets. I had trouble getting through these chapters, wasn't impressed with them.<br /><br />The last two chapters are kind-of interesting again. Chapter 7 talks about the mindsets to parents, teachers and coaches and how they create one of the two mindsets on their students and children. The last chapter in the typical \\"action\\" chapter of a book which gives tips on how you can change your mindset (from a fixed to a growth mindset).<br /><br />I found the book interesting, yet simplistic. It simplifies the world into two categories: 1) fixed, and 2) growth. (I kept wondering why there aren't more, such as 3) Not care). Then it continues the simplification by basically stating that fixed is bad and growth is good. So therefore, people who want to be successful need to change from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset. This (simplistic) view does make the book very powerful and lets the main message come through strongly (which is probably why it had gotten excellent ratings), it did annoy me at times.<br /><br />In conclusion. The book is easy to read and written pretty well. The message is kind-of important (people need to keep growing and improving). Yet, the book didn't impress me and at times annoyed me. Therefore, I'll only stick to three stars. Sometimes recommended.ut the mindsets to parents, teachers and coaches and how they create one of the two mindsets on their students and children.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|This historical fiction provides the backdrop of our generation.  It provides clarity to the Times that shaped the lives of our parents and grandparents.  Well written and easy to read.  We must choose from the past as we shape the future.  Ken Follett is one of us and I can not wait for his third book in this trilogy.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great book. I read it in one afternoon. Once I started it, I didn't want to put it down .
B000W91RUG|5.0|Love this DVD! I wish it had the gag reels like the other seasons, but still worth getting. They're so funny!
145210655X|4.0|This book pictures typical childhood situations in a humorous way.  If you are a fan of children's books and Star Wars, you will be amused by the author.
B004KKXMSI|5.0|Great set of movies, happy to have the collection! Definitely worth getting the Blu-Ray. Great documentary and behind the scenes on the Blu-Ray.
B005LAIH3G|4.0|A bit too long - but good.  There were a few places that could have been shortened and it would not affect the story
B001FB4VXU|5.0|So worth getting! Hours of fun and entertainment. The gag reel is great, too, which is not on Season 1.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|They never asked Jacob about the knife. Why was the girl murdered? Having the mother drive into an abutment was totally out of character.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I didn't know what to expect, but it was definitely not a disappointment. Now a favorite game for me.Lots of fun.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I enjoy this game very much. It is very addicting. I look forward to collecting and breeding new dragons! Why do we need to write such long reviews......
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|This was a very good Movie.  It had a lot more action than I expected.  Some parts were a little hard to follow, but still worth a look.  Would definitely recommend!
B0063IH60K|1.0|I did not like this product because as soon as I opened it to play, I received junk mail offers.
0547564651|5.0|Well written, really accessible work that underlines the important of ecological context when considering students with risk factors. Inspiring examples and a hopeful message for what we can do to help our students.
B000KJU182|5.0|Great story. It was a sad ending. The actors were really good. I would recommend this book for people who like history.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|Like this a lot because it clips the Kindle fire into place. A 10 yr old does not need little elastic straps to do the job. Wanted purple but is wasn't available. Red was the next &#34;like&#34;.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Never laughed so hard watching movie some drug use but really funny adult movie, not for children.Really enjoyed this film.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|you must read all three books!  great trilogy - great love story! i loved it and read all three books in less than two weeks!
B004OXCL5Q|5.0|Awesome version of a classic. Was amazed at the quality of the sound and the picture. To bad it is only region 2
0316044695|5.0|Marcus Luttrell is a true American Hero.  He is what exemplifies the definition of courage, bravery, and sheer determination. Amazing stuff!
B00138CYD4|5.0|It's pure Santana, what more could I say.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good album to listen to.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Great game. I am determined to get perfection with each. It makes some simple ones seems difficult. I like it!!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|This is another good read by Clancy. But not a great as when he turns out out a book by himself. Tom, I'm rereading my collection - time for a new book!
B0000508U6|5.0|I purchased this cd a few months a go and still are listening to it in the car .Never get tired of it.Would definetely recomend it.
B008745B32|4.0|I'd forgotten quite a bit of this book--it was quite accuratly depicted on tv --but is still an vivid picture of times long gone.  Learning about English Catholic history was interesting--once years ago my husband and I ended up at Westminster Cathedral instead of the Abbey- a unique experience, with all the English Saints and colorful mosaiics on display.<br /><br />revisitin Revfisited
B00269FOHM|5.0|I have been in love with this movie from the very first time.Had been trying to rent it to no avail.So,many years later,I decided to<br />purchase it from Amazon.Glad I did.Very well acted.Very sensual and romantic.Never get tired of it. I would recomend this movie.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Awesome! Our whole family loved it!! Saw it at the theater then rented it and now own it. Worthy of watching over and over.
B0072GPPNC|4.0|I liked the movie but I thought it would be more about the horse itself, not so much about the owner.It was good and I can appreciate the making of it. I'm no movie critic, so I don't know how to describe what exactly was missing in there.I just know that it left me a little disappointed.Still, I watch it from time to time and do enjoy it.I think my favorite part is the part where the english and the germans get together trying to rescue him from the barb wire.  That was funny.
B0025KVLSI|3.0|I didn't realize the CD would be in a hard cardstock paper. I was expecting a hard plastic one. Sound is good.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the whole series!! It wasn't what I expected, but the author wrote the story in such a way I couldn't put the books down!!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Bosch continues to delight with intricately woven story lines. One of Connelly's best, well worth the read and while you are at it, read the rest of the Bosch novels...you won't be disappointed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the whole series!! It wasn't what I expected, but the author wrote the story in such a way I couldn't put the books down!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read the entire series of books and while this one is not the best, I can't give it less than 5 stars. Rapp is not only about the action but about American values and not letting political correctness destroy America.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the whole series!! It wasn't what I expected, but the author wrote the story in such a way I couldn't put the books down!!
B007EECSFA|5.0|I have read all of her books so far. I love her style of writing, and the fact that she keeps you interested from the start to the finish.<br />She is truly a gifted author.
0790729393|3.0|Bought this a while ago. Arrived on time and in good condition. The deal breaker was that I had requested a DVD that came in a regular DVD case. This particular movie arrived in one of those cardboard &#34;snap&#34; cases. I HATE the snap cases. Also, the DVD needs to be flipped over mid-movie in order the watch the entire movie. That was the first time I've ever encountered that with a DVD. So while the movie is excellent, the snap case and the fact the DVD needs to be flipped is a deal breaker. That's why I've given it 3 stars instead of 5.
B00914JWSW|5.0|I saw Barbra on November 5th in San Jose and her show was spectacular. She sang one song &#34;Didn't We&#34; from this new album of songs that she never released. Her voice is huskier, mellower now, but still packs the punch that is her trademark. This album is wonderful because she sings &#34;One More Look At You&#34; from A STAR IS BORN that is in the movie, but never released as a single and it was always one of my favorites. I would have bought this album for that song alone. She leaves her indelible mark of songs like &#34;How Are Things in Glocca Morra&#34; and turns the final song &#34;Home&#34; from THE WIZ into an anthem. I played that song over and over because it is so great. There are lots of other great songs but these are my faves. I hope she does fulfill her dream to play Rose in GYPSY because it will be another FUNNY GIRL style triiumph. Long live the lady Barbra!
B003SI05PG|5.0|I had no idea what a fun movie this is. It has everything, excellent animation plus great music and a good stoty. A definite keeper!
B005LAII12|5.0|This movie is sweet, crude, crass, raw and hilarious all rolled into one joint. Why are people complaining about vulgarity, lol, it has a big UNRATED sign on the cover. It is Seth for gods sake, he is all the above mentioned. A movie about a talking childhood toy and people are expecting the next Kramer vs. Kramer. This movie is a blast, I mean, we have all heard the f word before people.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|FUN - great puzzles; nice graphics; good storyline.  I wish that the game was a little longer.  I finished it to quickly.  Worth the purchase.
B000TO0T4O|5.0|It was a heart stopping thriller. Alex kept everything fast paced and amazing. Being part of this experience was amazing.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|this game rocks!!!!!! EVERYONE NEEDS THIS GAME!!!!! if u r thinking about getting this game.... don't think...GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!please help me and download it
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It is a Brian twister! You really have to think when you play it, it is an awesome game! I sometimes find myself during all my power up on my kindle!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is on  of my favorites and some of the cool things about it is you can earn ham  money when you play and with that game money you can unlock New games
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Such a great book! Although would have enjoyed a lengthier ending; all in all amazing book! Nicholas sparks is great!
B008M721MS|1.0|I tried to Skype with my brother and nephew, I could see them, but they couldn't see me. Tried everything. So disappointed!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great graphics, good plot, lots of locations.  Played in casual mode on a kindle fire. The only criticism that I might have is that the &quot;game pieces&quot; were so spread out that most of the game time was spent moving from one end of game &quot;board&quot; to the other.  The hidden object scenes were great.  For $1.99, it was well worth it.
B009IEXKXI|2.0|A great story line is marred by disgusting profanity. I am ex-navy and have a thick skin, but find the profanity repugnant. I didnot complete the book. If the author just left out the bad words the book would be excellent.
B00005JNQS|5.0|My 3 Grandsons really enjoyed it and continue to watch it. Great movie for young children to watch these days.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|This book is &#34;beach&#34; reading.  I thoought it was typical...you pretty much knew how it would end from the beginning.  Jut felt it was a very quick written book and and did not take much creative thinking to write it.I could see where it would make a good movie, tho.
B00APUQPX6|5.0|Our family loved this movie.  Very funny and entertaining - even for the grown ups.  Probably my favorite of the series.
0316228532|1.0|This might be entertaining for some but I quit reading about halfway through. The characters were utterly unlikable and the story just wasn't interesting enough for me to want to keep reading. All the foul language and lack of morals in any of the characters made it even worse. Maybe it would've gotten better but I had had enough.
8866131350|5.0|This is the perfect size for my purse and it has plenty of room inside to jot down appointments or notes.  I also like the band around it that can be used to either save the current weeks page or to hold the cover closed to prevent it from spreading out inside my purse.  I would definitely recommend this product.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I would recommend this book to almost anyone. Whether you are a teenager looking for something relatable or a middle aged man or woman wanting to look back on your own youth.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|There aren't enough colors for drawing and also I accidentally clicked on someone's name that I don't want to play and there's no way to take it away.  So there are a couple of glitches in the program and there's no way to find out how to fix them.  Otherwise, it's really fun and I like it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I read this book because heard it was so good!!! I found it a chore to get through,  I'm  not  sure if I want to read the next book.  I think it was okay definitely not as great as I expected.
B000UU4NE4|1.0|I'm absolutely baffled by this movie.  How could it be so painfully boring?  I mean, it's got the same director, the same charqcters as the last two, which are completely enjoyable, unlike this one.  I beg, that someone please just erase this from existence and do the proper &#34;part 3.&#34;  Really, it's that bad.
1401323820|5.0|Never a doubt that these were  the best. Couldn't wait to get them. I am collecting all Richard Castle's books.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|We never thought much of the hype of Blu-ray, but I have to admit after buying a lot of boxed sets (Star Trek, Star Wars, LOTR, etc.), we're sold on the format.  It really does make a difference, as long as you have an HD TV and an HDMI cable.<br /><br />Well worth the money for the set if you enjoyed this series of movies.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved this book. This book is the best Diary of Wimpy Kid book so far. I will take my A.R.test on Monday
B0026772N8|5.0|In this world of reality TV, instant gratification, and moving through life at a blinding pace, Zen is a welcome journey.  Read this book, and take your time pondering each message. You will be better for it.
B005VPRETE|5.0|She. Loves it and plays with great toy ever day great toys too many words too many words to many wods
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This was the best book I have ever read in my whole life. I think everyone should read this book.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|As expected this is an excellent mystery read. Highly recommend it for mystery buffs  and those who enjoy good writing
B00AQMSJI2|1.0|the game takes so much space that even after totally wiping out all my apps music and books there still isn't enough space on my kindle fire....another waste of my money...thanks a lot amazon..this is the 4th app ive purchased that I cant even play due to the size
B00008OE4W|5.0|Have wanted to see this movie forever and saw it on Amazon at an affordable price. While I love this movie, it is dated and we've come so far from this dated movie, but I still love it. Thank you
B0031RS44S|4.0|Bad Luck and Trouble, Another easy read!  As with most of Lee Childs books. Just about to the end of his Reacher series

B003O86FMW|4.0|Couldn't put it down. I need to know what happens next. Ready to dig into the last book to book 3
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Very enjoyable, fast and easy read. Reminds us that our great country is still very vulnerable to a crippling surprise attack. Looking forward to the next Clancy installment.
B0084IHVC0|5.0|It was as stated  It arrived in a timely fashion. I was impressed with arrival and no errors in processing.  Received email that it had shipped. Very nice
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|Great TV series!  It's been a long time since a good cop show has come along.  The stories are original, the scenery breathtaking, the acting impressive, and the cinematography is outstanding!
B001BR5NN0|5.0|Completely enjoyed this movie with the next generation of viewers in my family! Doesn't need the R rating.<br />We loved it!
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|This is truly a good movie.  The more into the movie...the better it gets.  I think this movie gets overlooked quite often, but the music and the acting are good.  Ralph Macchio is brilliant!
B000O8OTNC|2.0|I might have received a dud so I gave it two stars.  Did not work at all, dis not put an edge on my knifes or sharpen them.
B000I9YLWG|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time, certainly the best horror flick.  Hitchcock was a genius. If you've never seen this film, you have to check it out.
B004BSFC6Y|5.0|My 4 month old daughter loves her feet, so these foot rattles make playing with her feet even more exciting.  They fall off easily, but so do all of her socks.  All in all, I would buy more for her and as for gifts.
B005DOKK7Q|5.0|I had a lether cover before purchasing this sleeve.  The leather cover made the Kindle heavy when I was reading, watching movies or playing games.  I bought this sleeve to protect my device but make it able to sit it aside when I use my Kindle.  The quality is great and I love the color I chose.  I went from a cover that had all of the bells and whistles which was too much to the simplicity of this sleeve and I couldn't be happier.
B009MO5G90|2.0|'Disc/package was fine, but the movie was by far the worst Resident Evil movie of the series.  Skip this one!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Easy read. Always love Nicholas Sparks. This book doesn't disappoint. Can't wait to see the movie. We actually saw the set this summer in Southport.
B002VPE1XE|2.0|The case in general has a good built quality the material are good and light. The down part of it is that as is a universal in my case it was to big for my digital camera so had to buy another case. This came as a bundle gift. So it works but for a more bigger camera than the ones Sony make.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|It is too bad that you have to spend real money to make real progress. But it is cute and sweet.
B009AY04A8|3.0|It 's ok but too much conversation and loading.  The puzzles are very simple.  The artwork is well done.<br />You do not get the chance to use common since to solve things.
B009B0L324|4.0|I like listening to the live music. Ac/dc does it better then any other band out there. great christmas gift.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it.It's kind of a challenge.I actually like a challenge.If you get it and then delete it I would be ashamed
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Did not like the way I say is used so much very good book would recommend to anyone to read
B00514HDNW|4.0|I had no idea the movie was based on a book, so when I found this I had to read it.  Its completely different than the movie, but that isn't really a bad thing.  It left me guessing until the end.  Not terribly long and easy to read.  A neat twist on the movie, or I guess the movie was a neat twist on the book.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This book was one of the best I have ever read!!!!! I hope Nicholas Sparks writes another one soon. It was sad but amazing at the same time!
B007FEZQF8|3.0|I'm sure comic book purists will like this more than I do.  I read it hoping to get a jump in the series so I didn't have to wait for another episode a while back.  The plot is COMPLETELY different than the series.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, Katie is a role model to every women in an abusive relationship. I wish I was like her because I would have gotten out of my last relationship a lot earlier. This book is very inspiring! The movie will be so amazing!
B0039NGAZY|5.0|This movie, especially in the unrated format, is hilarious.  Definitely a classic and a must see.  Just make sure to watch this version, not the rated one.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Will keep you guessing right up to the end.  Good job. David Baldacci  does it again. Hope to. Read more of Will Robie.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Contains the uncut versions of the original UK production. Not hacked up  as it is on US PBS. The quality is excellent, and the price is very low for the many hours of enjoyment it provides.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Loved the movie! One of my all time favorite movies.  Great cast of actors and adaptation of the book. Well worth having.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|I was disappointed in the character development in this movie.  The characters were flat.  The actors didn't have an opportunity to explore their characters as it felt that they were just trying to cram too much into the story.  Not my favorite.
0385536828|3.0|Ian McEwan has garnered many awards for his numerous books, but I would not put this book into an award winning category.  I thought it would be a book of intrigue and suspense, but the plot of the book did not carry forward any action except verbal exchanges and dialogue which, to me, bogged down any hope of action.  Anything that seemed suspenseful(a bloodied matress, a mysterious follower, etc) were explained in the most ordinary way. I enjoyed the little stories within the novel, and thought the ending inventive, but it was a slog through the remainder of the book.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Excellent Christian movie, really heart warming and enjoyable movie to watch. Can not find a lot of movies such as these anymore.
B001CZJKS0|5.0|I love spooky movies.  I watched it in the theatre as a teenager.  I have added the Halloween: 30th Anniversary Box Set to my collection.
B0091REZMW|4.0|It works great. A little confusing for people like me who are not big takers but am enjoying it nonetheless
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|The special effects in this movie are outstanding!!!  Liam Neeson is a great actor.  He is absolutely fantastic in this movie!!!
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|Visually very beautiful and well done. Consistent as a prequel, however story somewhat confusing and not very clear. Definitively worth seeing.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nice job on this app. Devellopers seem to wwnt to be one of the best.  Easy to use and fast and respovsive on start.
B004U52VPS|5.0|This is a great alternative to screen time.  The kids really get into building shapes and then knocking them over with the birds.  Can't beat the cost/value of this product.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|this old classic is sure to bring back many memories.  Even the grandchildren who thought we were a bit &#34;square&#34; found delight is this timeless story.  Thanks for a package that arrived in a timely fashion, was well packed, and in great condition
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Bought this set for my hubby and he loved it and for the price it was even better would recommend for all Matrix fans out there
B009E3EY4M|5.0|Wow,Just amazing to see all remaining Led Zep band members together again!!! Jason Bonham on drums is awesome!! He doesnt miss a beat!!
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|hI had to rate it with something...or else there wouldn't be any stars. I thought I would spend my night being sick enjoying something funny. TED is not the movie for that. In fact, it's not a movie worth anybody's time. The idea, I'll admit, is cute. The  execution is vulgar and horribly done. It makes me very worried for the future of Hollywood and the kind of comedic films being produced these days....just awful. I DO NOT recommend this.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|Indy looks great on Bluray and the special features are excellent. The packaging is beautiful, but it is rather difficult for me to get the discs out of their sleeves.  It's not a big deal; you do have to really man-handle the discs to get them out.
B000F8O35U|5.0|This was a Terrific kids classic movie fun for whole family to watch that was difficult finding in the stores.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|Who doesn't like Angry Birds? This creative and entertaining game is so much fun, and quite a challenge. A must have.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a very good Harlequin. I have read a lot of them and I thought this one was one of the better ones.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|This is my favorite app on my Kindle. HOWEVER, there are too many bugs! Sometimes it starts off going way too fast and most of the time it freezes/lags and stops working. Makes it hard to play. Love the game, hate the bugs. Fix and I'll give ya all the stars you want!
B000JIHP88|2.0|I was excited to receive this mobile.  My ds wouldn't sleep in his crib, and after reading the reviews I thought- this is it, lull him to sleep with this entrancing mobile.  I took it out of the package and quickly ran upstairs to attach it to the crib.  Unfortunately, it only fits in one direction, and because our crib is curvy and thick- and wasn't going to work.  But, I was desperate- &#34;this was it&#34; I needed my ds to sleep!  So... we crafted up a stand with 4x4's and up went the mobile (slightly tacky but for a good cause).  At first ds didn't care for it, the light was too bright for nigh time.  However, I worked it into the routine before bed.  Every night we push the same button, we rock in the chair, and then I put ds in his crib to watch the mobile.  Beautiful!  Then, one night we were rocking and I looked up to see the mobile frozen.  The music was going, but it wasn't peek-a-booing or spinning.  So I quickly assumed the batteries were dying.  After replacing the batteries and screwing it back together everything worked again.  Until the next night, yup- frozen again.  I guess the leaves are just to heavy to play peek-a-boo every night.  I purchased this mobile when my son was 3 months, he was 6 months when the mobile started freezing on us.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son wanted this e is five.  He loves ths game , got it on his taboo and e is happy
B001N1DPDE|5.0|The tool is amazing. It is an all purpose knife that can be used for a variety of tasks. The knife is heavy yet effective. It can literally be used as a hatchet, small machete or a general knife. I carry this knife with me everywhere.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a well made, strong, all prurpose knife.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great series, fast read! This is a great series for all ages to enjoy, I would highly recommend it to everyone.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Saw this in the theater but I was distracted so I missed a lot.  I'm really glad I bought it and watched it again.  Cute and made me laugh too.
B008NABUU8|2.0|I have problems playing this game, can't seem to build but one bridge. Must be me, just not my cup of tea.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This is a great value. The convenience of having this work on a mobile device is hard to over state.
B004V5A7K8|3.0|The control of the paddle and ball doesn't work very well on the kindle, needs some improvement and then maybe I would play the game more.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|I would recommend this DVD to anyone who asked me about it. My grandchildren ( ages 6 and 3) were totally engrossed in the movie from beginning to end.
B009LK6JS2|3.0|Would love this game if it didn't crash so often. Controlling the flight path isn't the easiest I have played. My husband is a pilot and he loves the graphics.
1451662432|5.0|This was a requested gift for my mother-in-law and so far she is really enjoying it.  Thanks so much for it.
B007FJFDXS|4.0|Wish it had a map to it. The rating system seems a bit cheesy graphics are good and I do like the game.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Headline says it.  Seemed to me to be a little too much concentration on personal stuff I didn't care about, not quite enough on social interactions and consequences.  Still, a superior book from a superior auther.
074322454X|5.0|Makes you appreciate the sacrifices of those who go to war to insure and protect our freedoms. Outstanding story and writing.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|my kids love this game. couldn't ask for a better game to keep them entertained. just wish that some of the guys were a little easier for them to beat to earn the money to buy new games.
1600243711|5.0|Every book by NIcholas Sparks is good, so no surprise when this was so good I couldn't put it down. A must read!
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This is a great item.  We loved it.  Fast service and the contenst of the box were more than we expected.  For any Sound of Music Lovers - it is a great item.  Makes an amazing gift.
1451695195|4.0|I like this book because it explained the near death experience of a Neurosurgeon and in his own words.<br />I told some one that I was her father in a another life and she really didn't believe it. I send her this book to reassure her that I wasn't that crazy.<br />This doctor had bacterial meningitis and survived. He was in a coma for 7 days.<br />It also help me with my mother who was in the hospital at that time.She was send home after I finished the book. My mother wasn't leaving this year.<br />I recommend this book.
1577314808|1.0|The description for this book was new and it most certainly was not.  Through out this book there was writing, highlights, and dog ears.  I will not be purchasing from Traci-Lee's collectibles again.
B0063IH60K|4.0|good card game. I play it all the time. easy,  fun,  and lots of ways to play. have fun with it and always enjoy it.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I like it but my animals keep walking or flying out of there cages I mean common really? When ever I touch them they ether fall over or go slower I am mad about that but the rest I love!
B00338QENI|5.0|Very interesting topic. Have actually used HeLa cells in research projects but didn't know where they had come from or from whom they had come. It is nice to be able to humanize the source of the cells. Now I know the story of the woman from whom they came. What a great contribution to science she has made. The world should be very grateful to her and her family.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I don't play many app games. I like fairly simple logic puzzles like Quell, Flow Free, and Kunundrum. This game, like those, progresses in difficulty in a slow, steady fashion.  I don't like games that are frustratingly difficult or have hard-to-learn directions. I play app games to relax. If I get frustrated, I stop playing.  I might as well be working if I'm going to be frustrated!  Anyway, this game fits well with the category of the previously mentioned games.  Only game better than these in my opinion?  Jellflop. Though not a puzzle game, it, too, has a relaxed feel to it. I hope those of you who enjoy slow-paced, straight-forward thinking games that don't require speed of play or overly intense  concentration find this review useful.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Thank you ms Collins for a wonderful series of books. I couldn't put them down. I am very pleased with the ending!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|John Corey is one of my favorite characters and the suspense was so well done that I caught myself trying to breathe quietly lest the Coreys be discovered and killed.  This has all the best elements of a thriller, plus, it has what I call &#34;meat on the bones&#34; in that I learned something about the situation in that area.
B000PAAH3K|5.0|A must read for anyone interested in improving their judgement and any person who is responsible for training others. This book will change how you approach any and all decisions, and explain many of the decisions you have already made.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Lee Child is one of a handful of authors whose books I anticipate and then read with pleasure.  His Jack Reacher character is well-crafted, the plots are deliciously intricate, the settings vivid, the villains nasty, and the endings satisfying.
B0016Q2D5M|4.0|Interesting plot, includes believable characters, decent special effects.  An educator guide is available for earth science week.  Plot includes enough earth science facts that it could be shown in a middle school classroom after a unit on rocks and minerals and the structure of the earth.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Wonderful entertainment; thoroughly enjoyable.  Photography is excellent and captivating.  Yes, I recommend this series, particularly to people who enjoy British costume dramas.
1400034779|4.0|Characters in this book are defined by their actions, not what they look like.  Enjoyable journey as the main character outwits and puzzles out situations for her clients.
B005XLN97M|5.0|No tools were needed for the elves to put it together on Christmas Eve. It didn't even fallen apart after 10 year old's were caught &#34;playing&#34; with it. Well done Mattel!
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|Mraz and crew have so much fun on stage and the sound is great. It's so much more contagious when you see it and if you can't go to one of his concerts this is great. Can't wait for someone to video &#34;Love&#34; album concert!
1595141715|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone. It is a great read that makes you step back and look at how you treat people or how you are treated yourself. Very educational. I think it should be available to all teenage kids.
B003JTHXOK|1.0|I did not think that this book was memorable.  It was very slow reading.  Sparks can do better than this.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />Based on the novel of the same name by Nicholas Sparks, The Notebook is a bittersweet love story that pulls you in from the beginning and doesn't let go until the end credits. The opening scene is just beautiful, and the scene in the rain is just one example of perfect storytelling in cinema. The score by Aaron Zigman is romantic. The acting is top-notch. Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams, James Garner and Gena Rowlands star.<br /><br />Personal note: I nearly cried during one scene towards the end of the motion picture. The scene is very moving.<br /><br />The only fly in the ointment of this production for me are two uses of a religious profanity (ie. God's Name combined with a mild profanity) about 92 minutes into the movie. It seems inconsistent with the time period that the movie is set in. \\"Thou shalt not take the Name of the LORD thy God in vain, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh His Name in vain.\\" Why do film-makers these days feel the need to profane the Name of our Lord and Saviour?<br /><br />Rated PG-13 (two uses of a strong religious profanity & two suggestive sensual scenes).
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Entertaining, funny, great story. Alice Cooper was terrific addition to the film.  The actors were all terrific, too.  Johnny Depp was a cute Barnabas, but not scary enough.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved every minute, couldn't put it down.  A trilogy everyone should be a part of. It gives hope that anything can be overcome.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Awesome, graphics on all three of these are great.  Why so serious?  Typical batman movies that batman fans will love.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I started watching this series through Netflix because I kept hearing how good it was.  I am now hooked and wanted to buy the series to add to my library.  Season 2 cannot come out on DVD fast enough.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I didn't expect to suddenly find a new kind of sci fi these days. It is nicely stitched to current reality too. There are a few things, which irritate me as engineer, but... it's fiction, right?
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I got this series for Christmas and love it!  I can't wait for Season 2 to come out on DVD.  At first I was unsure about how good a series could be that was on &#34;regular&#34; tv but I can't be happier.  Excellent series!
B0000DCGT0|5.0|good movie
B006BXTOFC|5.0|I just got out of five year relationship and these songs just mellow me out! their great to enjoy and get you distracted from those annoying thoughts in your head! Great Album!
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|cute movie
B007M45PMU|5.0|This album couldn't be better and quirkier. honestly love the mans voice.<br />The songs i got the album for are just amazing and the rest of the album follow suit.
B004A8ZWVK|1.0|this movie would be a good movie if we could actually watch it all the way thur it freezes in several parts of movie we cleaned it and still didnt help wont trust seller again
B00943SQCI|1.0|This movie is terrible - a waste of your time to watch.  A real disappointment coming from two talented people - Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.
B001A5W8YA|4.0|All my comments about the Bond books will be the same so if this reads familiar, you have read it on another of them. I read these years ago when the movies started, when Craig did Casino Royale I decided to read it, (Casino Royale) again, I then decided to re-read the early ones, which I think are superior reads, but that is just me (obviously).<br />Very enjoyable, not to serious though.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Omg I was just so mad that the book end ,I just can't to read the second book so excited. This book was really good. It reminded me of a thing I'm going through right now.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|i love the story line but i did not like the use of the f--- word so much. she could have done that with out it
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I make it a point to avoid watching trailers for movies that I eventually will want to see.  This shifts my expectations from what I already \\"know and have seen\\" about the film, to the level of interest I have because of the talent behind the scenes.  Often, I discover movies simply by following the writer, director, actor, composer, etc. to see more of their work.  I came in expecting to see Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis in a science fiction/action/time travel film to kill a few hours.  I got SO much more than I was expecting!<br /><br />It's not uncommon to see an actor portray different roles in a film, but it was very refreshing to see Levitt portray a young Bruce Willis - every eyebrow raise and smirk, all his mannerisms were there.  The concept of sending someone back in time to be erased is nothing new, but the idea of \\"Loopers\\" is that you can make a pretty good living off of it.  In fact, that very life is contracted - you agree to kill bad men and not ask questions, and in return you live your life as a wealthy man... until your loop is closed, and you are eventually sent back to terminate your own contract.  The knowledge that you'll be the one offing yourself at some point of time in the future, along with the daily \\"business\\", attracts a certain kind of person of questionable moral character.<br /><br />And there it is - that's what surprised me.  The characters were well thought out, each realized with their own intentions and backstory equaling the other.  Outside of Willis and Levitt, I was surprised and entertained by the casting of the main \\"villain\\", and thoroughly enjoyed the roles that became more than players at the side of the stage.  I'll leave it at that, and ask that you \\"go in blind\\" as well.  It's a clever movie, with characters that are far more interesting than they should be.  You could certainly do worse with your time!
B005KJJ4F8|3.0|Starts to get boring very little story line that can be summed up quickly after reading the first book, alot of politics to follow but the main character keeps on kicking. The Prince is in danger and the Princess is a real different type of hero!
B000002GA8|5.0|Love this one. Wakeman and the ochestra are fabulous. David Hemmings naration is exceptional. If you like Wakeman, you will love this.
B000FCK65W|5.0|I remember when I first began to read this book for class, didn't understand how a book could be about nothing and still be a classic. But after it all, I've come to classify it as a book about life, simply put. It's a grotesque, truthful, yet beautiful description about life that can be loved by all.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I highly recommend the last movie of the Dark Knight trilogy! The contents in the blu ray are excellent as well!
B000000QFY|4.0|Wow, can't get enough of the energy delivered in Hocus Pocus! Sorry for my girlfriend, for who \\"yoddeling\\" as became as painfull as hell! Yet all the rest of the album is slow and relaxing. Experience it.
B008V4H6N6|5.0|A definite Journey, I feel like painting something, but I can't paint. Erykah Badu and Thome Yorke on the same albulm- What more can one ask for.
B007DJUO8O|5.0|This album is something far from the ordinary, a trip somewhere but hard to say where. It has to be listen at with headphones, a comfortable sofa and if possible with a good whisky. Just awesome, and even sometimes scarily. Deserves a try!
1609611543|5.0|For me the author makes alot of sense.  Like the way it is written, understandable.  People who have tried and tried to lose weight, couldn't.  This may be the answer for them.  I'll let you know if this is my answer.  I truly like the way author uncovers several  things about what has been done to the growing of our food.  Its great!
B003MOHX8S|4.0|Epic soundtrack music for those who enjoy the energy and strings of the a Hans Zimmer composition, moving, energetic and powerful.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Yet another awesome cut the rope based game but this one is a little cooler in terms of music other than that cut the rope was a better more popular app but i still like them both
1616960922|5.0|This book offers a unique magic system, great character development in such a short novella, and a satisfying ending.  I would recommend any of Brandon Sanderson's books to all new and veteran fantasy readers.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Wow the makers did a great job. My only complaint, is that whenever i go on, theres a glitch. The glitch is this, theres a completely  fake welcome thing, and you cant ex out of it. O t herwise, it would be five stars.
B009JBWOU0|3.0|DVD version amazon says, \\"special features with all 3 films\\" isn't true, \\"the story of Bruce Wayne\\" & the Theatrical trailer for \\"Batman Begins\\" is the ONLY special features<br /><br />The BLU-RAY version is the ONLY version with ALL special features
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Great book! Very suspenseful. I read it a lot at night and had to force my self to go to sleep at about four in the morning.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book to read over and over again constantly for a long long long time. A+++. You should recently read it.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great story, a little slow in the beginning, but definitely a page turner. I can't wait for the movie to come out!
B0037VNX44|5.0|This movie takes the real life of Michael Gordon Peterson and plays it out with dark comedy. This movie might not be for all people but if you give it a chance, you will get a view into the life of a man who has spent the majority of his life in jail (by his own doing).<br />Is he crazy? Is he a product of nature vs nurture? Does he have an institutionalized mentality? Psychotherapists cant seem to agree....so make your own conclusion after watching this movie. I enjoyed this movies creativity. Tom Hardy delivers another amazing movie worth seeing.

B005LAII12|3.0|Although raunchy humor isn't my favorite, I am a fan of Seth McFarlane's dry, witty humor.  His work on the Family Guy is genius.  Unfortunately, this was raunch with not quite enough of Seth's trademark intelligent humor to make it tolerable. I watched it all the way through hoping it would get better but it didn't.  The best scene - the recitation of white trash stripper names.  If you've seen that in the previews, then you probably don't need to watch the whole movie.

B00992CF6W|4.0|I enjoy this game..from creative to survival. I feel its lacking though. The features are to basic. It needs to be updated to the PC current version. It also needs an enhancement in controls as I find them difficult as much as others. Other than the downs there are also ups. Like fighting mobs..cool environment... crafting table is extremely basic..dungeons....different terrains...etc<br /><br />There is also a lack of space in each world and there needs to be armor...<br /><br />Concluding this review. I would recommend minecraft to anyone who enjoys building surving and thriving!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|My only suggestion to make it better would be more choices for the alarm sounds.  I would prefer some of my own music to be my wake up call.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is a really captivating and thought provoking book.  I enjoyed it so much I am reading it a second time!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing! The love and bond they have for one another takes my breath away. I love the twists in the book and some of them I saw coming but then there were others that shocked me. This book is a definite must read. I finished it in one night because I had a case of the \\"just one more chapter\\". that is how good this book is!
B005LAIIHG|1.0|The movie has great visuals and an interesting story. Unfortunately, the fact that the story was stolen makes it impossible for me to enjoy it. The one star goes to the special effects.<br /><br />The book that gave origin to the movie is a PLAGIARISM from the book \\"Max and the Feline\\" , from Brazilian author Moacyr Scliar. It is ironic that Ang Lee tries to discuss metaphysical and religious themes when he is guilty of accessory to theft. One's morality should begin at home, I suppose. Does anyone care ? I guess not. We have fallen into such a sad state of lack of morals that anything goes today.<br /><br />It is EXACTLY the same story. Shame on you, Ang Lee, shame on you, Yan Martell. Go have an original idea. Plagiarism hurts art and artists.<br /><br />I am surprised and sad that most people just don't care at all about the plagiarism, which is blatant. Unfortunately, Scliar was a tired old man (he has died since) and just didn't have the resources and patience to sue. I hope his heirs do.<br /><br />Google Scliar for many articles about the plagiarism that were on the press.<br /><br />At least the movie should have a mention \\"from the original story from Moacyr Scliar\\". Martel was so dishonest that he said he had only read a (non-existent) review of the book, but the story is the same: someone who flees from a country in a boat full of animals, suffers a shipwreck and survives in a dinghy with a feral feline (in the original story, it was a jaguar). For goodness sake, people have been sued for 10% of this.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Easy and fun app to play doesn't take  much and isn't very hard very fun and you don't need real money to play!
B008AX1HD8|5.0|This gets five stars because its set in Oz and I'm an Ozzie!<br />But I do love Jo Nesbo and his laconic style and fancy his alcoholic, agonised cop Harry loved his Australian sojourn.<br />There are well drawn characters here (including an educated insight into the plight of an aboriginal Australian) and a masterful unfolding of the expected Nesbo &#34;bag o' tricks&#34; as the plot changes tack more times than a skiff battling up wind.<br />Treat yourself!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Great insite into what may be our next conflict.Some of Jack jr. exploits are a  litttle lame but overall I really enjoyed it.
B002RI9ZPY|4.0|This final episode in the trilogy continues the personal development of the intriguing Lisbeth Salander and also returned Blomkvist to his chosen career path as Social Democrat reforming journo, this time dealing with a branch of the Swedish secret service.<br />Larsson handles the complex and many stranded plot with aplomb and takes the reader on a headlong roller coaster ride which continues to the very end.<br />Maybe the best of three! Certainly left me regretting the authors demise.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was a good read. Will say that if you are squeamish with crude talk just be aware it is frequently there. Would recommend.
B007DIQC90|5.0|\\"My Head Is An Animal\\" draws its CD title from the lyric of the opening track, \\"Dirty Paws,\\" which is a bouncy anthem with what might be an allegory.  With its pounding rhythm and vocals sounding like a chorus of female soldiers, it's incredibly catchy, \\"They used to sing about the birds & the bees; The bees had declared a war, the sky wasn't big enough for them all; The birds, they got help from below, from dirty paws and the creatures of snow.\\"  The second track \\"King & the Lionheart\\" continues in the same vein, an upbeat tune with a lyric that appears to be about continuing on in the face of difficulty, \\"Howling ghosts they reappear in mountains that are stacked with fear.\\"  \\"Mountain Sound\\" is the third track, completing a strong 1-2-3 punch for the freshman set of this Icelandic band.  It has a similar sound, a march-like upbeat tempo like a soundtrack to an epic adventure.  The ninth track, \\"Your Bones\\" is also a favorite of mine with male vocals -- Ragnar I assume -- that are passionate, \\"So hold on to your heart.\\"  I read the CD reached #6 on Billboard's top 200.  It is easy to see why with such catchy music and interesting lyrics.  Enjoy!
B00316DDUE|5.0|Es un concierto excelente, lo mejor que he escuchado de Yanni.<br />La calidad de los músicos que lo acompañan, el sonido, en fin es un concierto que vale la pena escuchar muchas veces
B008ALA6DW|4.0|This works it's from Apple. Again not thrilled with special (costly) connector types Apple is using on their computer and iPhones but they come with the territory. We believe that this adapter or a RJ-45 Ethernet port should be on any laptop from Apple but that is a minority opinion at Apple apparently.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I purchased this DVD concert based on hearing her amazing voice on<br />radio.  After hearing her CD's and over-the-air I knew I was in for a gift.<br />This concert DVD is an excellent add to anyone Adele collection.
0375758992|5.0|I take reading and writing very seriously.  Alexandra Fuller rights with a rare level of honesty and sensitivity to emotions, both her own and others'.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Adele is amazing.  She has a beautiful voice and a magical talent.<br />It feels like she is singing right to you.
B00026WU7I|5.0|to rate this album properly.  I won't waste words describing it. it speaks for itself. I can say that the remaster is a significant improvement in terms of clarity, especially on the vocals, though the bass is a little thin for my tastes.  That goes for all the Dylan remasters I've heard, actually. On a good stereo it's still a net gain, I would say.
B008MWBY6W|4.0|I like the look of this bag, and examining its construction, the seams looked good and the material is solid. It has decent padding, and includes a strap.<br /><br />However, it was quite a bit smaller than I had hoped it would be. My Nikon D50 (yes, ancient, I know) with the shortest lens (my fish eye) just barely fit in this, lens down. Paranoid or not, lens down is not my prefered orientation for carrying a camera around. I just don't like the idea of putting the weight or the motion on the lens or the mount.<br /><br />There is absolutely no room whatsoever for a second lens, so only consider this if you have \\"one lens\\" type of shooting events (and don't mind carrying your camera lens down).<br /><br />The pockets are small and tight. They will be suitable for spare batteries, a couple of filters, memory cards, and a cleaning cloth ... but not much else. The normal bag I carry is on the small side of medium sized, but has enough room for the camera with two alternate lenses and my tiny Sony HD digital video camera to boot. I don't think I've ever shot anything without changing lenses at least once, so now that this bag has been tossed to the back of a cabinet shelf, I don't expect it to emerge from that spot.
B000002GKT|5.0|How did I get through almost forty years of life without hearing this album?  Humble Pie didn't have the versatility and daring of Led Zeppelin (but who did?), but as far as unpretentious, blistering, relentless rock and roll, this is top of the heap.  It's two LP's worth of material on one disc that they're practically giving away. Buy an extra copy for the car.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I love this game.  the only bad part about it is it doesn't let you save a User name so can continue the game if you get a new device.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This is another great book from Tom Clancy. I highly recommend this book from a master of his craft. 5 stars.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Graphics at great.  Sometimes the story line gets a little long.  Games are challenging and fun.  Not just random matching objects. You Need to think and solve the puzzle before advancing.  Would like to s more similar games.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I recommend this book to all who like adventure and fiction<br /><br />It's a great book for all ages whether old or young
B007L6VR12|1.0|I watched this movie because it had a 94% rating from Rotten Tomatoes, which I had never seen for any other movie before.  Let me be very frank here:  this is the type of movie you would expect from some untalented french director who thinks he is an artistic genius.  This movie is not witty, nor funny, nor smart nor are the characters likeable, interesting or quirky.  Moonrise Kingdom is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, primarily because the viewer is acutely aware every minute of the movie that the people behind it were trying hard to create Oscar material.  Moonrise Kingdom is a waste of time and money, and not even Bill Murray can change that.
B0075PYG1M|5.0|Nice smooth easy listening! One of my favorite albums of 2012! Original creative and entertaining! Looking forward to new music in the future!

B003TSEEDY|4.0|I think in the end the person he was talking to should have wrote one letter back to conclude the stoyry
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great game to have if your grand kids play your kindle!!!!! It's one of my favorite all time carnival games.....
B007MNV5WU|2.0|This game is too hard--that is, it doesn't seem to make much difference how you aim or figure projectory, the birds just go anywhere.  Too, projectiles, given the same aim, will not follow the same arc/path.  It ceases to be fun if is so random. One should be able to build up some skill rather than rely on whatever the game's computer decides to give you.
B005C6HGSG|5.0|We always hear about Sam and Dean (which is always great!) But it's nice to hear about Bobby 's stories too!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I would recommend this to everyone! The love peers has for he  is amazing. Just overall perfection. Definitely a favorite!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like the option to let the app move the card for you by just tapping. use this while waiting in line. not too much thinking just something to do to fill the (wait) time!

B008K6HN8I|4.0|ES File Explorer is easy to use and powerful enough to suit the tech guy in me. It allows me to explore my Kindle foldres, view files, and delete those I no longer need. I've only used local functionality. I have not tried LAN, FTP or Net functionality. I haven't had a need.
B001AKTZOQ|4.0|wish they would have left the live tracks off the cd and kept it as original recording, would have been 5 stars otherwise.
B000FS9MV0|4.0|I enjoyed Renee Olstead's self titled album. I gave Skylark to my daughter but had a chance to listen to it. I love the standards and Reneee covers many on this CD. She really does make these her own and the songs I've heard sung by dozens of singers seem fresh and new. While she is not my favorite among current female singers, she certainly fits in the regular rotation.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|This is a fun & addictive game, where you earn various credits, including a &#34;monetary,&#34; allocation. Why can't these credits be used for additional game &#34;credits?&#34;
B008XX6J4C|4.0|The Piano Guys make music fun. They are fun to listen to and even more fun to watch. Their arrangements of classical and popular music are outstanding. I especially like Titanium/Pavane, Peponi, Code Name Vivaldi, Michael Meets Mozart, and Rolling in the Deep. Cello Wars is terrific but loses a lot without the video. Enjoy!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book changed my life. & the movie has the same effect. I love this story. I hope that everyone gets a chance to read this. It's fantastic.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the best books I've read in years!! I read this book before I read the 'Slammed' series....loved it so much I was bummed that it ended. Sky and Holder are by far 2 of the most incredible characters in any book ever...love love LOVE them! Thank you so much Colleen Hoover for writing this book, I can't wait to read more like this one. I read Slammed and Point of Retreat after this, both good books...but not even on the same level as Hopeless. Wish I could give more than 5 stars :)
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game is so addicting as with all Game Circus game's. The only problem I have is that it takes along time for a prize to drop only to have it drop off the edge, this would not be such an issue if the prizes dropped more frequently. Other than that I love it. I would definitely recommend this game to my friends and family! I look forward to more game's from Game Circus.
B0055OK2T0|4.0|The previews for this movie really do not give a clear impression of what this movie is about.  Once I began watching it was a very pleasant surprise.  Good action, romance, humor, and an entertaining story.  I recommend this especially if the review has left you uninterested.
B00797MB0O|2.0|One thing you can say about Charlize Theron- she doesn't mind doing ugly.  This movie is just depression in cinematic format.  I kept waiting for... something.  It never happened.  I could have turned off the movie 20 minutes in and not have missed much.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I had no idea what this book was about I read simply becuz I read slammed an point of retreat n loved them.... an sure enough hopelessis anything but....reading this book me felt like I was watching a movie that captured me from the very beginning til the very end.. an what happens in the middle I can def say ull never see coming... this is def a must read!!

B0076DCT2G|5.0|I recently discovered the John Corey series and can't seem to get enough.  DeMille is back to the page turning writing exhibited in The Lion's Game.  One does need to read some of the previous John Corey titles, such as The Lion's Game, The Lion, and Wildfire, to fully grasp the storyline.  The historical information of Yemen is presented in an interesting and sometimes humorous manner.  The Panther is a non-stop thrill-ride.  I highly recommend The Panther to anyone interested in thriller, suspense, or mystery novels.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I was excited to see Indiana Jones in a blu ray collection. It is a classic set to have. The quality of the movies are great. My only complaint is the packaging. The movies are in slots and you have to give them a little tug to pull them out. Other than that I'm very pleased with my purchase.
B002OFWG7E|5.0|This ia an awesome cd if you like the Foo Fighters but haven't started purchasing any of their music yet. It has a great mix of old a new tracks and three bonus tracks to enjoy.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I was completely surprised at the theme and charm of this lovely book.  I did not read anything about it before or see the movie. The value of a real honest to goodness childhood and the need of warm human contact could not be better illustrated.
B0096BIENY|4.0|Part of IL Divo is the seeing as well as hearing.  Good to be able to hear in the car but missed the sights and staging

B005GRTNVE|5.0|They continue to get better and better.  Great staging for this performance.  Would recommend it to my friends.  Well done.
B005LAII9O|1.0|After watching this a couple of nights ago I came to Amazon to see if others found this to be as horrible as I did.  To my surprise, as of this writing, the average review is 3 1/2 stars!!  While not great that is waaay too high for this pile of crap!  All 3 of the leads are are annoying and unlikeable.  I guess we are supposed to find the pot-smokers with the easy Southern Cal lifestyle and the hot blonde to be cool people we would want to hang out with and eventually get behind as the movie progresses.  NOT AT ALL...You've the cliche veteran tough-guy with some psychological baggage, the neo-hippie white-dude-with-dreads that is a pacifist and wants to save the world...and then the most annoying of the 3 is the hot blonde with the worst voice-over narration of any movie I've ever seen.  She sounds like a moron that just woke up but tries to say really profound things that make us go \\"Wow, that's some deep stuff...how interesting and witty she is\\".  But, it is all just so freaking bad.  Bad writing, bad characters, and some of the choices by Stone to show the girl in black and white or slow motion for no apparent reason other than to say \\"Hey look at this Vanity/Vogue photo shoot camera technique of this hot chick I have in my movie\\".  SPOILER ALERT--------the fake ending was just garbage and I found myself extremely disappointed that the three characters didn't really die!  I was actually rooting against them.<br /><br />The only positives were Benicio Del Toro and Travolta.  Del Toro was great and Travolta added some comic relief, even if it wasn't very believable.  Hayek was pretty decent as well.  Funny that all of the antagonists were who I rooted for.  Sometimes that is the intent of a movie...not so here.  What a waste for these actors.  Do not blind-buy this one!  Rent at your own risk.
1935670913|5.0|I may have to purchase another copy. Wonderful book a must read for anyone who wants to start their own business. Very informative branding and using technology to help promote your product. The book is an quick easy read that gives important pointers for succeeding in business endeavors. It was both entertaining and enlightening. If I cannot get my book back will definitely buy another copy.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Just got into this show. Had to purchase season 3 episodes from amazon to catch up, well worth the little price. Love it
B009KHDT0C|3.0|It was entertaining nothing really brilliant or spellbinding like the Dark Shadows that used to come on PBS when I was little.  A little hoaky at the end. I expected better from Johnny Depp.
B0012QK8G2|5.0|One of my top 5 live albums of all time! If you like Thin Lizzy, you'll absolutely love em live!
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|I like a lot of the Gameloft games but this one doesn't seem as advanced. Graphics are good but need money to get animals rescued, which I don't. like. Alsonhave to accept and place your &quot;gifts &quot; right when you get them instead of them going into inventory until you are ready for them. You also can't move things around once they have been placed. Can't. seem to get enough Monet to buy things needed to complete missions because rescuing costs so much. Also don't. like having to get friends to accomplish tasks, those never get done for me. Not my favorite and will be removing from my device.
161293112X|5.0|A Christmas Carol has always been a favorite of mine. I have always liked the moral of story and what it teaches. That each of us can strive to be a better person and yet accept each other as they are.

B007VUA7VO|4.0|This app works very well with my Kindle HD. You can customize the colors & settings. I'm sure the paid app works better, but hey this is free! As long as you don't mind small ads; it's worth the download.<br />Update 1-6-13<br />Downloaded the Battery Pro. $2.00 there is more you can do with the paid app. I like the paid version too.
0763644765|5.0|I bought this along with a couple of other potty books to jumpstart potty training. We tried at 18 months but she wasn't quite ready and wasn't overly interested in any of the books. Now that she's turning 2 in a couple weeks, we're at it again and this book is the FIRST one she always picks out of her bathroom book basket, EVERY time she sits down. I don't mind reading it over and over again either since the words are simple and she laughs a the noises he makes when he has to go and when he finally goes. She has even started saying \\"I did it!\\" like he does at the end of the book. It's also nice to have a book that applies to either sex so it can be passed down to any future siblings. Love it!
B006YC74E8|5.0|great app love it has lots of new possibilities i am just exploring all thats out there and this is one of my favorities
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book took a while to get really into because some of the information was not necessary.  Once I got into the book, however, it was really good!!  You just have to keep reading :)
B000LGZHDS|4.0|This is exactly has expected and it was nice to be able to order a whole set of spongebob characters.  If you know a fan, this is a perfect gift.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|The characters lack of common sense hinders the audiences ability to enjoy the story, and as the audience experiences a story (intellectually and emotionally) on the backs of its characters (by recognizing pretty and/or ugly human behavior), poor characterization and unbelievable motivation leaves the audience with few ways to enter this story.<br /><br />Characters without the basics of self-preservation make no sense to an audience (who after all are animals living in a hostile world).  Even the smallest fish (with the tiniest brain) will try to avoid a net, thus demonstrating a recognition of danger and a desire to continue living.  Most characters in Prometheus showed no such basic commitment to their own lives [SPOILER ALERT] (ex: upon reaching destination in the cave, almost immediately removing life sustaining and life protecting helmets on an alien, unknown, unexplored planet; trying to pet a hostile snake-like alien; and the list goes on).  Almost across the board the characters make poor choices inconsistent with life (which makes no sense to the audience as the story is not presented as a suicide mission), so no surprise by the story's end, most of the characters are dead.<br /><br />The problem is that in a similar situation, most of the audience would not have made the same choices.  I think a 5 year old would not have removed her/his helmet - the fact that the scientists, doctors and experts do so push the audience right out of the story and into critical analysis (and a critical audience is a hostile audience); dido for trying to pet the alien snake.  I think even an infant would have avoided the hissing alien snake (though they'd probably watch it from the safety of their parent's arms if they were a comfortable distance away), and I'm positive 99.999% of toddlers would have avoided same.  So when an adult male with specialized training - who wants to leave an area after he comes into contact with a dead alien, but is so entranced by a live one thathe forgets all rules of self preservation, is promptly killed, the audience rolls their eyes.<br /><br />And it doesn't matter that this behavior comes from a secondary character.  Poorly constructed secondary characters (non-leads whose behavior makes no sense given the story premise and their job title in the story) ruin good films all the time - so much time and effort is put into making the primary characters appealing, that secondary characters' character development is often ignored.  Yet secondary characters provide the frame into which primary characters are placed; secondary characters provide the \\"world.\\" If the story's world makes no sense to the audience, it doesn't matter how attractive the leads are, the story won't fly.  A story is only as strong as its weakest link and cannot reach its full potential with poorly constructed secondary characters.<br /><br />George Lucas comes to mind as showing a solid working knowledge of this fact as he demonstrates successfully in Star Wars: the jawas are believable as alien tinkers, the Skywalkers are believable as isolated farmers, the sandpeople are believable as opportunistic predators - these secondary characters' behavior and work are recognizable to the audience and so make sense and serve to strengthen the story, therefore making the story believable.  [A story is a proof, after all.]  In my opinion, the clear sign of a subpar script is poor secondary character development; in an expensive special effects movie like Prometheus, it's like putting a high end paint job on an inexpensive car.<br /><br />The audience for Prometheus would have accepted as reasonable the two lost scientists (who needed to have gotten lost by somehow losing their equipment, or some other logical reason, as no reason is provided in the film [a mistake on the filmmakers part]), spotting the snake-alien, fleeing, and being killed subsequently, if perhaps the snake-alien exhibited an unusual skill set prior to attacking (for example, being able to hover over the scientists, defying gravity, or any type of unusual hunting technique not previously seen, and done so fast the scientists have no time to effectively counter).  The audience could buy that and would have remained in the story, but it is impossible for most people in the audience to believe that anyone would wish to pet a never-before-seen, hissing, snake-alien.  Especially considering that these same characters recently fled when they saw a dead alien.<br /><br />The job of filmmakers is to create a story that makes sense to the audience - the audiences' reality is the ruling reality.  If the filmmakers' story makes no sense to the audience, the story fails.  Prometheus fails because the filmmakers do not understand that the audience judges the protagonists (good team) characters' reactions to the story's hostile environment and antagonist (villans) characters, as well as against the audiences' reaction to said antagonists and hostile environment.  Somewhat of a mental game the audience plays, audience intellectual/emotional investment in a film stems from an comparison/competition on the audience's part between the audience and protagonists, with the antagonists/hostile environmental as a backdrop, forming a triangle.  The audience puts themselves in the story, subconsciously, and reacts to the story's threats.  We react to threats as the animals we are - physical safety first, for ourselves, our loved ones, our team, our group.  In a way, the protagonists physically stand in for the audience (in the audience's psychology), and when the protagonists' reaction doesn't match our own when we assess the specific threat being presented in the story, and the protagonists or someone on their team comes to harm because of what the audience perceives as the protagonists' inappropriate reaction, the audience blames the protagonist, and subconsciously, on an emotional level, exits the story.<br /><br />For instance, had the scientists initially fled from the snake-alien and subsequently been killed by an unexpected, unusual attack - unusual as judged by the audience - the audience would have accepted the scientists death uncritically; but fleeing first was necessary because the audience's first instinct was to flee.  But the lost scientists were killed after one tried to pet a hissing alien-snake, something the audience would not do, so the audience judged the characters as nonsensical, blamed the scientists for their own deaths, and emotionally and intellectually left the story.  Prometheus takes a logic hit and does not recover.  Two hundred million dollars spent for a fail because the filmmakers do not understand how an audience engages with a story.<br /><br />Comparison and assessment are at the heart of audience intellectual/emotional participation in a film.  As the audience, I guess the challenging process of filmmaking, i.e., obtaining funding, attaching stars, scheduling, is so overwhelming to filmmakers that the audience's needs are often ignored, and yet studios seem surprised when expensive films fail.  But the audience never wants a story to fail.  The audience wants entertainment, pleasure, seeing a representation of itself on the big screen.  The audience doesn't enjoy seeing poorly constructed films - we pay twice after all, earning the money to view the film (and we all know earning money takes time); we pay again by giving time to view the film.  Time is the ultimate gift because we have a limited amount of it.  Therefore it is clear the audience, willing to pay so dearly for a commodity, desires that commodity.<br /><br />In Prometheus, the filmmakers had the writers kill off secondary characters in such sub-common-sense ways that the audience could not enjoy the story.  Characters in inexpensive slasher movies fall like flies, but the audience knows it's a horror movie and accepts the convention.  More was expected from Prometheus, prequel to the really good Alien franchise, but clearlythe filmmakers ran out of ideas; no crime just disappointing.  The acting, cinematography, set design, visuals, and other technical work on the film was fine (though shots seemed to be missing). I am curious to see how the survivors fare in Prometheus II, so I'll check out the movie from the library when it is released next year.<br /><br />Grade: disappointing story and character development as audience comes to film with high expectations, but overall, watchable due mainly to solid acting, cinematography, and other visuals.
B004WCTLNY|5.0|Movies are hard to review because they're taste specific and some people could write all about plot, the acting, directorial nuance, yada yada yada...and other people will write: awesome!  great!<br /><br />So to fall somewhere in the middle, if you like romantic adventure that's less suspenseful than the Bourne movies and less romance than Pretty Woman. It's pretty much a great date night movie or a great movie if you're alone and don't want like Die Hard but also don't want Steel Magnolias.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|I read this book because is a must read and I heard it mentioned in many movies/shows that I thought I had to give it a try.  I was not interested in the beginning but it turned out to be a page turner although I was disappointed at how it ended, not sure there was any other way to end it but while reading it I wondered if there was a movie about it (never searched to see)...some how I kept picturing Gerald Butler as Heathcliff.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|It was somewhat interesting, but it was slow, hard to follow the logic of the characters and the story line at times, very unsatisfying ending. I wouldn't call it a total waste, but I wouldn't recommend it to a friend to watch.
B006FE83UE|5.0|Having never read the book in high school or seen the movie I have to say I was surprised by it. My son had to read the book for his English class and I thought I would also read it to see what it was about. No wonder this is a classic. I was surprised that a book written in the early 60's that was based on a story in the 1930's could still seem like something that just happened yesterday. The movie sticks to the book mainly with only a few little things taken out. Some people will write reviews and tell you the whole story, but this a story that you need to see for yourself. I really think people should read the book first and then enjoy the movie. According to the story, to kill a mockingbird is a sin. To go through life never experiencing this story, either by reading the book or watching the movie should also be considered a sin. This is a story that everyone should know and for anyone who has read the book or seen the movie, you need to share this with your family and friends.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I first want to say that I've been on a post-apocalyptic kick of reading, starting with \\"World War Z\\", Justin Cronin's \\"The Passage\\" and \\"The Twelve\\" and most recently before this, Stephen King's \\"The Stand.\\" So when I saw the reviews for this, I kept my post-apoc kick rolling and dove into it.<br /><br />The first, Wool-1, blew me away! The world had been created, the risks and consequences fully understood, and the characters believable. After that first \\"chapter,\\" one I truly thought to be gripping, genius and well-written, the rest of the chapters rather fell flat in my opinion. The political power struggles and plights to keep electricity on are nothing new (if not expected) in post-apocalyptic fiction, and not any better written. Again, I truly think it is unfortunate that I read this book directly after \\"The Stand.\\" I am STILL thinking about those characters and their stories. I feel like I know them. It will probably take awhile for another book to live up to that standard.<br /><br />But even then, I'm a little baffled at the nearly across-the-board 5-star reviews. Yes, it was a good, engaging read, but it didn't blow me away.<br /><br />I usually only review books on here when I feel strongly one way or the other, but I just wanted to add my two cents, because it would have been nice if I could have read a review like this after I finished the book to make myself feel like I wasn't missing something MAJOR by not having my socks knocked off by this. I don't feel like it was a waste of time, it just wasn't my favorite.
