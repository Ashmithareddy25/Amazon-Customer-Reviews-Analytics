B003U9W3GM|4.0|As a young man, Eugene Sledge joined the US Marines \\"to do his bit\\" in World War 2 and because of his choice of arm, he was sent to fight in the Pacific War against the mighty and tenacious Imperial Japanese Army. \\"With the Old Breed\\" describes his experiences in two of the nastier campaigns in that theatre, Pelelieu and Okinawa (and was one of the references for the HBO mini-series \\"[[ASIN:B003QP47RS The Pacific]]\\").<br /><br />We (in the UK) are perhaps more used to hearing of the European war, in which the combatants treated each other (for the most part) with a good deal of respect, even chivalry. Admittedly the truth may differ somewhat and the non-combatants were dealt with with rather less regard, but we generally consider the European war to have been a \\"civilised war\\". There was nothing civilised about the Pacific war. Lives were thrown away on both sides for posession of tiny coral atolls with a reckless abandon that matches the waste of the Great War. It was fought with a savagery and hate that beggars belief and Sledge pulls no punches in describing the horror; witness the scene is where a fellow marine removes the gold teeth of an injured Japanese soldier. This is not a comfortable book to read.<br /><br />Neither is this a military history. There are notes at the end of each chapter that add a little context, but Sledge wrote the account from the point of view of a private soldier, working from a battle diary that he kept in his pocket bible. He had little or no idea of the big picture and in most cases he had no idea of what was going on, full stop. His perspective comes from over the sights of his carbine; all he can see is the wall of his dugout, the bodies of friends and foe scattered around him. All he can hear is the rattle of rifle fire, the screech and crash of artillery and the screams of the dying. Sledge fully understood his position in all of this - as cannon fodder and no more - but he also understood the horror and waste of what was happening around him and he conveys the brutality and futility very well indeed.<br /><br />Reading some of the other reviews, however, you will see him described as a great writer, even to the extent that he is compared with Robert Graves. I have not read Graves but I am certainly not convinced that \\"With the Old Breed\\" counts as great writing. I don't want to dwell on the point, but the prose is awkward, unpolished, even clumsy in places. It was clearly not written by a professional, or even particularly experienced writer. Does this detract from the story? No, not at all* (or at least, not much), but unfulfilled expectations of literature do detract. However, these shortcomings do lend the story a certain honesty that you won't find in [[ASIN:0330255738 Dispatches]] (a book that I have come to detest for its smug self-importance), a naiivety that you wont find in [[ASIN:0099532816 All Quiet on the Western Front]] and it is, perhaps,  better for it.<br /><br />In the end, this is an eye-opening, gut-churning and deeply humbling account and it is well worth a read.<br /><br />* Perhaps, when we remember wars, we should take off our clothes and paint ourselves blue and go on all fours all day long and grunt like pigs. That would surely be more appropriate than noble oratory...

B0058EBNAO|5.0|First, the is not as User friendly as the other popular options.  but it is filled with great, detailed, and accurate information.  all the standard features and more.  you'll love the weather wheel when you get the hang of it.
0061785652|5.0|James Rollins has done it again.  His seventh in his Sigma Force series is yet another rollercoaster ride, and possibly his best book yet.  His mix of scientific and historical facts and \\"what if\\" scenarios  create highly readable, high octane action and suspense novels.  A mysterious explosion in Utah is at first deemed to be the work of terrorists.  But events soon suggest that it's the start of a chain of events that could threaten mankind with extinction.  The trail leads to Iceland, before taking us back to a trail across the United States, even into Fort Knox, culminating in a desperate race against time in Yellowstone National Park.  Rollins neatly takes such diverse subjects as nanotechnology and the founding of the original 13 colonies, and weaves them into an intelligent, well plotted story that will keep you reading into the small hours of the morning.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I purchased this with my Kindle app on my ipad because of the great reviews. I'm so glad I did. I love to find new authors. I'm a sucker for \\"end of the world\\" stories and I love this take. The character development was very well done. I love the way the entire concept was introduced - I felt like I was trapped in a silo of sorts, craving a glimpse of the bigger picture. It kept me turning the pages. I also enjoyed the treatment of group psychology, the perpetuation of traditions and the struggle for individuals to break free of groupthink and blaze their own path. I also enjoyed the moment of understanding when I realized why Hugh titled it \\"Wool.\\" Now, I'm going to grab some more books from Hugh.

B007CKNX28|4.0|Blunderbuss is fantastic! It is however, one of those albums that REALLY warrants repeated listens. There's no way to take in everything musically here, and understand or obsorb what is going on within the 1st listen. The reason being, all the different type of song structures and styles contained within it's beginning moments to the very end. He was obviously having fun here, during a very creative moment. Alot of times an album such as this, with so much variety can be overwhelming or feel like a mixed bag, but here it works wonders. All songs flow well into the next, each song finds you wondering about the next track, what's around the corner, and when it arrives it;s just as good, if not better than what came before. It's all very interesting and melodic!<br /><br />My point is, give it a few spins, and trust me, it will sink in, and you will enjoy. Just don't come looking for a White Stripe album, appreciate this as a seperate project all together. This might actually bring him a wider audience!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I absolutely love this book, and I'm so thrilled my professor assigned it.  I don't know what I can say here that the other five-star reviews haven't. All I can really think of is this:<br /><br />When you get really sucked in to a book, don't you sort of \\"become\\" that main character or narrator in your head? To me, that's the mark of a good book.<br /><br />Here's the thing: I did that with this book, and it's narrated by a five-year-old. That's a mark of a great book.
0062082353|5.0|Thank you for your service and heroism, Chris.  I thought your book was outstanding.  For all you naysayers out there that enjoy sitting on your couch watching Survivor with a 5 lb. bag of popcorn and a diet coke, it is soldiers like this that make it possible for you to do so.  As a Navy veteran from the 1st gulf war, it sickens me when people discredit our military force.  Yes, War is hell and this book describes what many US soldiers have been through since our country was founded. I certainly am not a hero, but there are countless others out there like Chris who are.  I think it is my duty to research those stories and honor those who sacrificed their lives to allow me to enjoy the life I do right here in Colorado.  If you don't like it, kindly move to Canada... or France.  I've heard it before, but it's worth repeating... \\"if you can't stand behind our troops, feel free to stand in front\\".<br /><br />The only sentence I had a problem with was... \\"if you don't have that on your chest, you're just another Navy puke...\\"<br /><br />Thanks, again Chris - for this book, and for what you guys stand for.  Go Navy!

B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Everyone looks back on their teenage years with rose tinted glasses but very few can honestly say that their lives have turned out as they expected they would. Falling in love with the someone seemingly unsuitable at a young age is a story that is common but unlike many other teenage romances this one doesn't fizzle out after high school but stays very much alive after twenty years of separation, prison sentences and a unhappy marriage. It's a testament to the power of true love and the feeling of time lost.  I enjoyed this story as a whole and the writing was excellent but I felt that the the plot was one that has been rehashed over and over again. The story had enough twists and turns to make it interesting but I felt that the basic plot was very predictable and unoriginal. One thing that struck me in particular was that as romantic as being faithful to a memory may seem I find it so unlikely that a hot looking man wouldn't have had at least one sexual relationship in over twenty years. If you enjoy thrillers with good plots then I would recommend [[ASIN:1475011903 Hunting for Sparrows]] for something a little different!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I'd heard about Angry Birds, seen pictures of them on t-shirts, but had no idea. I've never been a big video game fan, but I am \\"hooked\\" on these little birds. Their personalities, the sounds they make, and their \\"fighting abilities\\" are perfect for their physical appearances. I have needed a distraction and the BIRDS help take my mind off some serious things in my life. It is fun to figure out how to use the birds to kill those creepy green pigs. There is strategic planning involved. Lots of fun.
B005MMJ84K|3.0|I have to say this story was very well written and fun to read as the first book was too. I do have some issues with this story though. For one I saw the ending coming again. The author did have to get the other characters back into the story line but really  - please surprise me better.  I actually thought okay when is it coming?  Boom...<br /><br />I wasn't as put off by Lena's new romantic interest.  I did have a problem with how easily he accepted the relationship - Lena took a whole book almost.  I know everyone else is upset with Lena about this relationship but I think this poor girl has just run the gamut on emotions.  She clearly misses Alex and human contact.  She decided to leave home and safety for the Wilds for that human contact, to just have it denied to her once she was in the Wilds.  Denied not by law this time but by circumstance.  Wanting to love someone and feel loved is a very human condition.  Everyone told her Alex was dead - she had no proof otherwise.  Although I will say when she was looking up her mom I was thinking look up Alex!  I thought he was alive and kicking but I think it just shows she really thought he was dead.<br /><br />She is also tormented by her own thoughts, wants and similarities between Alex and Julian. Who is the red herring?  Hmmm.  I think it's the guy with cancer. She cannot leave Julian behind because of Alex.  It's very ironic.<br /><br />As before why isn't this whole culture explained better?  Throw me a paragraph to explain why this all came about.  More is explained in this book but not enough for me to believe the underlining story.  I am great at suspending belief but a little bit would be good.  I also think there would be more people.  What happened to society to cause the cure?  How would \\"Love\\" lead to the destruction of the US as we know it?<br /><br />The cure itself still isn't explained better either. It's a brain operation behind your ear and it only works when you turn 18. Why? I don't recall my body chemistry changing the day I turned 18. However it is mentioned that having the procedure sooner is dangerous. It also left me to wonder about the segregation concept of boys and girls. If a boy or girl fall in love does that mean the cure doesn't work then?<br /><br />I also had the underlining problem with them keeping the contaminated invalids / scavengers / people.  Why not just kill them?  This is a ruthless society now.  They kill and do not bury \\"love children\\" so why keep the people?  In a society that doesn't have a lot - gas, cars etc....  why keep more mouths to feed especially when they don't care for them?<br /><br />So book three I will read because I hope this questions get some answers.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|This is the second book in a seriously amazing series. Gripping and entertaining - hard to put down. Very easy to read yet well- written at the same time. Love love love it!
0062082353|1.0|This book is a waste of time and money...not well written and boring...no action...hard to think a book about being a sniper would be boring but this one is...I could not finish it.
1440503257|4.0|Even though this is an unofficial cookbook, it's a real treat for fans of the Harry Potter books and/or films. The cookbook contains recipes for all of the food found in the wonderful world of Harry Potter (except for Butterbeer...what the heck is up with that?!). There are also other wizard-inspired dishes and British foods. The one thing that could be better is the addition of more photos showing what the finished dishes are supposed to look like. Regardless of its shortcomings, I am confident that HP fans will love it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love political fiction books, like they mock our current situation. I think these types of books actually cause people to think about what's going on today. We aren't shooting each other with bows, but we are hurting each other by not helping, etc. But besides that, there is the action and a dash of romance. I think this is a book for both boys and girls. Awesome, awesome, awesome.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|his app os great but it only works sometimes in my kindle fire I don't know what's going on but its great when it works
B00756GKBA|5.0|Once again she has outdone herself and is the ultimate pop ICON, this is a work of art at its best and impressed as always with every album that she does. doesn't really warrant that ridiculous warning that is put on it but that is just because of all the haters...

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Of course after finishing the first book, I just HAD to read more!  I enjoyed the story line and Book 2 more than the first...still \\"very entertaining\\" *wink wink* and not as much dom/sub as the first.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Once you start reading this book you won't be able to put it down.  I kept trying to put my baby down for a nap so that I could read it!  It was the most interesting, breath-taking, erotic book I have ever read.  A must read!
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Purchased \\"The Hunger Games\\" for my 12 year old granddaughter who loves to read. She finished it in record time and now is eager to get the remaining 2 books. She told me that she was \\"hooked\\" from the start and just wanted to continue reading. Loved the story and the characters. Guess I'm up for the other 2 books.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Not only is this book absolutely amazing, I purchased it through Amazon on my iPad and it was the best thing I ever did.  I definitely recommend it!  I couldn't put the book down!!!

B004A8ZWWO|3.0|This is modern-day Robin Hood in which the staff of a luxury apartment complex decide to rob $2 million from the same man who robbed their pensions from them.  Alan Alda does a great job of playing the Madoff-like villain, so unctuous and so charming is he at the same time.  Ben Stiller and Matthew Broderick are always likeable.  The plot and the execution leaves much to be desired, however -- there are so many inconsistencies and holes in the plot that it's really hard to sustain your disbelief.  And this movie is too politically opportunistic -- how many more movies do we need where the common folk get their comeuppance against the rich?  In this movie, the rich almost walks, and everyone else almost ends up going to jail.  In real life, the rich always walks, and everyone else does end up all going to jail.

B00029LNHS|5.0|I think this is the best CD Black Eyed Peas has made so far. Almost all the songs on it where hits on the radio. It's really fun to jam to, I love it! And it brings back happy memories of high school. Haha Enjoy! It's definitly worth .33 cents. :D
B0034IJ7M2|5.0|My experience with purchasing this item was wonderful! Condition of the book was excellent even tho I believe that it was listed as good or very good. Delivery was speedy too! Book review~great book. Adult language. Took an adjustment period to get used to the authors way of writing. No quotations in conversation so it was hard at first to separate speaking from thoughts. I have actually loaned it to 2 other people that have read it and also liked it.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|It is a free game that is an extremely slow pace unless you purchase in game resources with real green backs.  That is annoying but liveable.  To achieve one of the quests you have to link to friends with social media not a fan of that. The worst and one star worthy asspect is the frequent glitches.  Multiple times now the timers on the things I had active (buildings, animals, crops, etc.) glitches to 60 hours.  The only way to fix it is to wait 60 hours or wipe the game off your K-fire and start over. It is free bit I should at least expect a glitches free experience.  SAVE THE STORAGE SPACE FOR SOMETHING WORTH YOUR TIME
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I've played twice.  First time after about a day all the wait times for crops to grow, etc. went from a few minutes to four days.  I deleted it but then thought maybe it was a way to keep the game from growing to big by forcing you to tear down old structures and building new ones.  I gave the game another shot and played for about four days when the same thing happened only its now six days instead of six minutes.  After building a good sized town I don't want to rebuild.  I'm so disappointed -it had been my favorite kindle game.  I'm going to read reviews much more carefully from now on.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Its a great game for kids. my son plays it all the time. cant get him off of it most days haha.

B006X415GK|5.0|I ordered this doll for my 8 year old daughter who is just crazy about Monster High, she now has 1 of each doll that is currently out. She absolutely adores this doll and plays with it everyday. The only drawback to Monster High Dolls is that some of the dolls arms and legs can come off and be put back on and the parts are very small and easy to lose, so watch that. Other than that these are wonderful dolls that are very unique and fun for kids!!!! I purchased this Doll through Amazon.com which I order from alot.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My coworkers told me about this book and said \\"You've got to read this!\\".  Well, I did, and then I was hooked!  I plowed through The Hunger Games and jumped right over to Catching Fire.  Finished that one in a day and a half and had to immediately get Mockingjay.  Great series...not just for tweens.  I'm in my late 40's and I would compare it to the Potter series.  So sorry it ended with just 3 books!
0425221806|5.0|This is among my most favorite books of all time.  Watchers made me laugh, it made me cry (several times), and it made me bond with the characters in a way that left me yearning for more.  Koontz is such a talented writer, and develops each character so vividly that you're even left feeling empathy for the antagonists in the story.  This book takes its reader on a thrilling journey, exploring the points of view from all characters, and somehow finding a way to let you identify with each and every one.  Though cleverly summed up, this book's ending only leaves the reader wanting more. Sequel, sequel, please!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is complied of tons of games, most of which are very entertaining others are poorly made, I like is game because these games are fun when I have a break during the day, or whenever.

B007CKNX28|5.0|For reasons that are now unclear to me, I wasn't really excited about this record coming out. I was an idiot. This maybe the most compelling album Jack White has made since... well, that depends on what your favorite White Stripes album is. (For me, it's Elephant). What we have here, then, is a collection of infectious songs that sound like they were recorded by people who were still very excited about playing them. I happened to be driving with the windows down when the opening numbers Missing Pieces and Sixteen Saltines were playing, and, boy, did that WORK. I nearly like every song on this, but the first 9 or ten songs are particularly good with special nods to Weep Themselves to Sleep and Trash Tongue Talker. There is looseness and energy about the performances that I think is rarely heard on modern records. This is certainly the closest thing to a genuine rock album--at least the way I understand the phrase-- that I've heard this year and maybe in quite some time.<br />  Lyrically, Jack is obviously working through some things in his life and, since I'm not a detective nor a tabloid reader, I do not feel the need to know all the details, so suffice it to say that the lyrics have a certain feistiness and honestly about them this time--perhaps more so than usual on Jack's records.<br />  The biggest surprise for me? The overall sound of this CD: it's warm, not overtly compressed with lots of space. (Other artists should take note.) I wouldn't be surprised if the whole thing was recorded on a 2-inch tape. And that is never a bad thing, as far as I'm concerned... Enjoy.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|WARNING SPOILERS IN THE  PARAGRAPH!!!!!!!!<br />I read the other two books in just a few days, but this book, I began to read and decided to stop after only one chapter. Even in the very first sentence of the book you can already see that Katniss is not the same person as she was earlier in the series. In this book, she seems so weak and emotional. In the other two books, she seems so confident and strong. This book kind of reminded me of New Moon in the Twilight series. Depressing and sad.<br /><br />Another thing that really bothered me was all the unnessecary killing off of characters. Some of my favorite characters were killed off without any reason. That completely added to the depression of the peice.<br />The most depressing part of the whole book was the ending, but i dont want to give too much away.<br /><br />If you dont like sob stories, dont read the book. But it had eimagination behind it, so i give it two stars.
0385737955|5.0|When i first heard of this book i was a little iffy about how it would turn out. But when i really dug into the book i couldnt put it down!! The way the author put you in so many twists and turns. Im a person how well cry to a lot of things and this had me so choked up i loved it !! Even my older sister who never ever crys cryed to the books. But pleas dont think its just some sappy girly book it has every thing in one amazing book. I LOVED IT !!!!!!
B000SEGMAU|5.0|The thing i like about Mitch Alboms books is that everyone teaches a special lesson in its own way.In this book he clearly expresses his point hes trying to get across.He doesnt go on and on.This is a story to be cherish forever in my heart.Congrats Mitch Albom for being a wonderful and incredible author.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Easy to learn but has a lot of subtle complexity. Getting a perfect on some levels seems to be impossible.
B0015DYIH2|1.0|I have been meaning to write a review about this for a long time, considering every time I explain to one of my friends my lack of interest in seeing the fourth movie they always inquire as to why? Welp, because the fourth book was literally 700+ pages of suck.<br /><br />Let me just start by saying that I am in fact a fan of novels Twilight through Eclipse. However, This novel was in fact so bad it flawed the entire series for me. As a reader, it almost felt like a slap in the face, at the lack of care or logic poured into this book. The previous novels in the series I found to be easy reads, I could finish them in a little over a day. Breaking dawn took me over a month, because at one point I put the book down and literally had to convince myself to finish it, by comparing it to \\"ripping off a band-aid\\", but the process of reading this book was not quick and painless. It was brutal and filled with agony. I have no idea why the tone of the novel and Meyer's writings just changed? Her way of attempting to tie in all the stories could have been drastically different. Although it is a work of paranormal YA fiction at what point do you say \\"woah\\". within regards to certain subplots in this novel, (like a certain werewolf and a certain someone's baby). Here is where I start my itemized list of critiques:<br /><br />The writing-Okay, the writing of this novel itself is simply deplorable. Meyer's writing in the first place is a little pretentious; considering it looks like she thumbed through a thesaurus during the entire process, with her going adverb and adjective crazy. Someone had stated in a earlier review that this novel read like a terrible fanfiction, and that hits the nail on the head. I couldn't get over the lack of professionalism or imagery drawn up from Meyer in this novel. Also, Meyer continuously broke her own set of rules, over and over. Like, Bella skipping the newborn phase. why do you ask that Bella skipped the newborn stage? Because Bella didn't want to go through it, so therefore she wasn't going to. It was like some twisted version of selfish (I mean selfish, not self haha) enlightenment. Bella's the golden goose and when it comes to anything Bella might have to do, there is a loophole or an exception.<br /><br />There were so many holes in the plot of this novel, that any lucid reader who wasn't blinded by sparkly vampires would have done the same, and objected like I did. For example, Bella tells Charlie she's getting married and he's pretty much okay with it; umm what? She's 18 and you're supposed to be her father. Get in there and parent! This is just another example as to how Meyer really had no regard for the logic in this novel, she was just trying to pump it out as fast as possible to feed her audience.<br /><br />The characters-Let me say that as a protagonist, Bella falls very short. I have never hated a main character more than I do Bella Swan. She's so prickly and un-relatable it amazes me that the series found as much success as they did with a stick in the mud, like Bella. Also, let me point out why is it that everyone loves her so much? Everyone in the novel loves her so and thinks she's so adorable when I think for a round character she falls flat. I find her impractical, incomprehensible, and down right selfish. Also, very stupid and impulsive; \\"Yes, I think throwing myself off a cliff will help me see a floating glimpse at my Vampire boyfriend, who at the present time wants nothing to do with me.\\" That's from New Moon albeit, but it proves my point. Someone also stated that in Breaking Dawn no one seems to object to Bella by letting her get what she wants, and I couldn't agree more. Edward moves from mysterious and foreboding vampire, to creepily over possessive, to complete and total doormat, come on seriously? And Jacob became some shadow of his former self, did he go off and finally realize he really didn't need Bella? Of course not!  (Spoilers) Jacob becomes determined to stay with Bella until she has her evil hybrid spawn and is turned into a vampire, yet he'll still love her and what not. Oh, but there's a solution. They can abort the baby, and then Jacob can have a baby with Bella the normal way, so Bella can still have a child and be the same old beautiful brown-eyed Bella everyone loves. Oh, and to add to the yuck factor that seems to be a present theme in this book; this is Edward's idea.<br /><br />The Plot lines-The wedding; I can't honestly tell you about the wedding, I just remember Bella wearing something conservative. I find it funny, because as I mentioned before Meyer uses WAY too many adverbs and adjectives with in regards to her descriptions, but one of the many aspects of this novel that all the readers I believe wanted to hear about she doesn't describe in detail, Oh okay. The honeymoon was like sticking a twinkie on a fishing hook, and dangling in front of a fat man on a treadmill. Everyone was waiting for them to have sex, after all the steamy romance scenes between Bella and Edward, I can honestly say I at least expected a vague description of a little rendezvous in Rio, but nope Meyer didn't feel like writing that because she felt it would be inappropriate to her target demographic, so I had to assume like it was the ending of the Sopranos where everything just goes black, but she talks about how when Bella finally becomes a vampire that Bella and Edward have headboard shattering earthquake sex every night, although we can't discuss it all when it comes to the honeymoon, no no! I do agree with her on the moral dilemma of not introducing her younger readers to sex, however Bella becomes pregnant, at the ripe old age of 18. Yes, let's send THAT message to the audience though. Don't show them sex yet inform them it's okay to get married to their boyfriends and have babies as young as 18. Last but now least, the ending with the Volturi. What a giant disappointment, they just came to Forks observed the area and left all but saying,\\"Carry on about your way.\\" I expected some dramatically climactic battle, but nope again, I was sadly mistaken, and please, don't even get me started on the Loch Ness monster baby Bella and Edward have...<br /><br />And that's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the flaw of this novel. It was a horrible piece of literature, and will remain collecting dust on my bookshelf.

0765316897|5.0|Favorite book of my favorite series by my favorite author.<br />Brandon Sanderson does a perfect job at keeping you continually entrenched in the story and wanting more at the end of each chapter.  The 'twists' that come into play have subtle foreshadowing throughout the story where a detailed reader can pick them up. But if you aren't much of a detail person (like myself), Sanderson gives you some great surprises.<br /><br />A must read for anyone who likes Fantasy books.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this app. I have been waiting for months for the amazon store to get this app. it works wonderful on the kindle fire and the hitch wildfire s. u draw something and get points when ur fronds guess the thing you drew right
B002VPE1WK|5.0|The is JUST as good if not better than the original canon bag!!!!!!!!!!! and I actually like this one better, because there is not a lot of canon branding all over everything which makes it less noticeable as a camera bag....PLUS, It was one hell of a lot cheaper and looks better.
B0067QPVJ6|3.0|The new version of \\"The Thing\\" seems to have absorbed a lot of Alien\\", although the stories are fairly similar, an alien creature infects isolated humans and starts killing them off. Of course \\"Alien\\" writers Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett surely knew the original \\"The Thing From Another World\\" made in 1951 and the original story \\"Who Goes There?\\" by John W. Campbell, so cross pollination could have been present from the beginning, but it looks like this \\"The Thing\\" took a lot of its look from \\"Alien\\".<br /><br />The plot of \\"The Thing\\" is close to the 1951 original and the 1982 remake, this \\"Thing\\" is supposed to be a prequel to the 1982 version starring Kurt Russell. An Antarctic scientific team discovers an alien spaceship under the ice and they inadvertently release an alien that has the ability to absorb and replicate its victims while the others in the camp try to scientifically deduce who the replicated are and to devise tests to prove who is human and who is not while the death toll rises.<br /><br />In this 2011 version Mary Elizabeth Winsted plays paleontologist Kate Lloyd who is brought in when the spaceship is discovered with an \\"organism\\" nearby. When \\"The Thing\\" is released from the ice, she's takes the Kurt Russell/Sigourney Weaver lead of finding \\"The Thing\\" hiding amongst them. The acting all around is good, there's nothing over the top and all the performances are believable, although by the end just about everybody has been screaming in horror and running down hallways or screaming as they change into \\"The Thing.\\"<br /><br />One thing \\"The Thing\\" does that other movies don't do is go inside the spaceship and that's where we see a lot of the alien comparisons, it looks like the set designers for \\"The Thing\\" were either highly influenced by \\"Alien\\", H.R. Giger or just had left over sets from the spaceships of \\"Alien.\\"<br /><br />Despite the \\"Alien\\"/\\"The Thing\\" interbreeding there was a lot of surprises in the story and the action kept the movie moving along without it being rote or formulaic, and there's a little bit of tension, but not too much. \\"The Thing\\" is for those who haven't seen either of the previous movies and if you have you'll still find yourself entertained and occasionally surprised.<br /><br />Bonus features include: Directors commentary, deleted scenes, and the documentaries and featurettes, \\"The Thing Evolves\\" and \\"Fire and Ice\\".ing along without it being rote or formulaic, and there's a little bit of tension, but not too much. \\"The Thing\\" is for those who haven't seen either of the previous movies and if you have you'll still find yourself entertained and occasionally surprised.<br /><br />Bonus features include: Directors commentary, deleted scenes, and the documentaries and featurettes, \\"The Thing Evolves\\" and \\"Fire and Ice\\".
006197806X|2.0|I was really disappointed. Not only was the love triangle terribly predictable, as were the \\"poignant\\" deaths of \\"significant minors\\" - what's with the four-letter words that had no place in the first book and half of the second?! I really enjoyed \\"Before I Fall\\", \\"Delirium\\" AND \\"Liesl and Po.\\" I don't understand why the sudden loss in focus. As far as dystopian fiction is concerned, bringing in current slang and expressions just brings me back to reality in a very rude way. If Philip Reeve, Philip Pullman and Suzanne Collins can write about strange new worlds without getting down to the level of unprintables, why not Lauren Oliver? I've complained about J.K. Rowling's stunt with Mrs Weasley in \\"Deathly Hallows\\" before, and the same complaint holds for \\"Pandemonium.\\" I have no problem with bad language, bleep words, whatever. I just don't like that they are thrown into the story in such a way that I'm brought back to my present without warning. You don't need this kind of thing to be categorised as a \\"Young Adult\\" novel. Come to think of it, why would any writer want to be classified as anything other than a GOOD WRITER?<br /><br />End of rant. I'm in no rush to read the last book in this trilogy, no hurry to Kindle \\"Hana\\" and, now I've got Lauren Oliver on my \\"watch list\\", my list of authors who are inconsistent and need to have an eye kept on!!!! Waste.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my daughter and I play this game together from anywhere in the world. I'm a Marine and deployed to Afghanistan and we still are able to play when I'm back in a safe zone
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy play. Best part is being able to use my own pic as background AND for the card backs. Plays best in portrait on my 7\\" tablet. No crashes, no issues.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The first two books were awesome.  So interesting and filled with drama and action!  The last book felt like some things were being added because she wanted to make it more interesting, the whole Peeta plot line was bizarre to me.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|I really liked this album. The vocals are fantastic, and the guitar work is straight dope. You really have to give this a try. You'll like it, too!
0439023491|5.0|Once I started reading, I could not put this book down.  Heart pounding thriller ... who would live and who would not ....????  I can hardly wait to start book three!
B0071DJZZA|4.0|I bought this for my Kindle ap on iPad 2. It's an easy read and I wanted to see what all the hype was about this series. I'm about half way through it and I would recommend it to teens and adults. Not appropriate for little kids for sure though.
0545265355|5.0|This book is exhilarating! You will want to keep on reading. The Hunger Games is by far my favorite. If you saw the movie you will love the book even more. Then scenes are more descriptive and paints a more lucid picture of what should have happened. For instance, the movie never explained that the wild beasts at the end are actually the dead tributes, and that rue is a little wild beast will furious petite eyes. Have fun reading people
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Great story and terrific writing! I couldn't put it down until I finished it. The story locks you in from the very first chapter and you fall in love with the characters.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|a little confusing at times but the storyline is very intriguing and keeps you guessing. worth the 99&cent; for sure
B006Z7Z3R2|1.0|That the old lady in this movie is tom cruises girlfriend from top gun. Haha.this movie wasnt scary,funny,or good in any way.please if you must watch it just rent it.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I loved this app on my phone, but the screen was too small. I was quite excited for those few seconds I read it was available on the Kindle Fire on FB, untill I installed it. No matter how many times I try, I can't connect via Facebook. If they fix this, I'd happily give it a five star rating!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Many things have already been said about the Hunger Games series - both good and bad.  I resisted reading it for a long time, but once the movie came out, I could not resist.  One thing I have noticed as a direct result of this book is that kids are outside more and they are learning to climb trees again.  They want to learn outdoor skills such as archery, building campfires and using thier imagination to solve problems.  This is great - they are actually turning off technology and tuning in to their environment.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I could not put this book down. The characters were well written, maddening and endearing. It is an easy read that pulls you in. There is violence in the book, though it doesn't romanticize the fighting. It is a way to pay bulks which is feasible. I plan on reading it again and other titles from this author.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Free to what extent? This game is tied to you eventually buying more coins. So is it really free? But overall the game is entertaining.
0385333846|4.0|The book itself was in perfect, brand-new condition, but it was a different cover which was disappointing. The only reason I had purchased this book was because of the cover.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I normally do not enjoy depressing books, which this most certainly was; however, this story was one I could not put down. It is very insightful and made me consider and take suicide much more seroiusly!! In spite of all the seriousness it was also just a very good story! You should definitely read it!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The book paints elegantly a country that is affected by strong and controlling government similar to the 1984 Book.  It goes farther than 1984 by showing how a person can initiate a revolution by just opposing the government that leads into a better improved quality of life for all.
B000XR4OC0|5.0|I Purchased my Toms in the Navy color...FIRST time purchase and I really adore them! Today I purchased the Ash. Eventually, I can see myself with every color available! First of all you will need to size down since they do run big and stretch out a little after the 3rd wear. They are super comfortable and easy to slip on and go! I have had my navy for about a month and there are no signs of wear yet! I wear them almost 5 days a week. For the other reviews that are bashing the shoes..these are canvas shoes and that is it! They are not made of steel and like any other shoe you purchase they do wear down after a while. On the other hand your purchase of any other shoe does not benefit the welfare of others...so I will stick with toms!I usually wear a size 10 AND PURCHASED A 9.5. THANKS!
6304493681|5.0|So I buy this since it is so highly recommended and I was not disapointed. If I had seen this some 20 years ago I would probably been blown away. Even by today's standards it is rather good. Solid animation and voice acting are found throughout.<br /><br />The story is a little hard to follow, as all good science-fiction usually is. I liked it. It has gunplay, weird science, and a 'futuristic' trend on society. Overall, very good film. I definately recommend to anyone who has not seen it yet.<br /><br />There is an updated version that uses CGI called 2.0. This version has the original animation and cast. The newer version has totally different voices I believe.<br /><br />Anyway, I am glad I bought this. It is not too expensive and is a nice addition to my video library.
0756404738|5.0|Simply a great fantasy novel, well written, thick plot, great characters.  I have read close to a hundred fantasy novels, the Wise Man's Fear is in my top 5.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|My child would not let me stop reading it after the first. I was asked to read it over and over so we could see who was the monster at the end of the book!
B007V5CF5K|5.0|I love this game soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much its fun and educationally that's why people like this game sooooooooooo much and there ar no dislike in this game<br /><br />awesome and fun and cool
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Lots of fun to play and very addicting. It completely froze up my kindle once already, though I did have a low battery at the time. Definitely recommend if you've got time to kill
B0055SWM08|4.0|Can't put it down, keeps me busy for hours! A definite recommendation if you've got any downtime on your hands!
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Blade Runner is one of my favorite movies of all-time. This collection is awesome. It has five different versions, including the ORIGINAL version that is so darn hard to get! The Original has the voice-over by Deckard/Ford, and is, in my opinion, the only version to watch. At least for me, anyway. The other versions seem 'distant' and 'dry'. I like getting into Deckard's mind, and the original version does just that.<br /><br />This is classic Science-Fiction meets Cop and Baddies. It is way cool and awesome!<br /><br />I am so happy to have found the original version! I would go to game and comic book conventions, they sometimes sell movies, but they never had a DVD copy. Now I have it! Wonderful! And on Blu-Ray no less!<br /><br />Two Thumbs Up!
0345803485|1.0|This book is just poorly written Twilight based crap. They overuse \\"Oh my\\" and \\"...\\" through out the entire book. It's filled with spelling and grammatical errors.<br /><br />I've read better fan fiction on other websites.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|id your looking to waste time then this game might work for you.  i'd rather play solitaire.  vert limit&eacute;s controls but graphics ar&egrave;n't bas.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|this game is awesome. addictive and totally what I look for in a defense game. first real game ive got for the kindle but....after 24 hours it becomes unresponsive. ive reset the game data twice before and worked fine after that but now it wont even let me do that. I'm just happy I didn't dish out money for the in game upgrades.  i dont know if thats the catch but the game is free not a demo to purchase.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|I loved this book so much, I went out and bought it in hard copy just to have it handy! I've read it at least 5 times and never cease to learn something new through each rendition. As an identifying introvert; I truly value the research and tenacity that goes into \\"selling\\" introversion to hyperactive, add-enhanced motor-mouths that we call \\"extroverts\\"...do yourself a favor and read this if you ever hope to understand your friends, neighbors and loved ones!
B002ZG980U|5.0|I love movies like this that make you think. This movie wasn't so much confusing as it was a puzzle to try and piece together. Every time I watch it, I piece more and more together. It was an experience. Nolan is a great storyteller like Ridley Scott. Cameron and Spielberg. If people are confused, they simply don't like to think. Plain and simple. Or they have no imagination. This was brilliant in a world of unoriginality. Another hit for Nolan.
B0071BY1T2|5.0|As far as visual aspect goes, it's perfect. Very tastefully done, without any effects (whoever did Live in Paris should be shot) that can take your focus away from the music. The stage is a bit dark, which makes the band stand out. There's a decent dose of closeup shots and that they are used when important - on solos and sections that Satch fans really care about. I always hated concerts when they focus a drummer or bass player during a guitar solo. Not this one.<br />Satch's live guitar tone was something I didn't like ever since the San Francisco concert. To my ears it was often dry sounding, bright and lifeless. A huge step forward is made here - very organic sounding, satchurated crunch, beautiful cleans and singing leads. Looks like switching back to Marshall was a great choice for Satch. Performance was spotless, as always. Set list contains a blend of great old songs we all love with a few newer songs. Maybe too many songs from the last album for my taste, but they make a good balance between heavy rocking songs and ballads.<br />This concert could well replace \\"Live in San Francisco\\" on my \\"favorite instrumental concert\\" spot. Even my girlfriend who's not into that kind of music enjoyed the show. For those of you that have a chance to see it the 3D version in the theater - go do it. Everyone else, grab a DVD/Blue-ray release and enjoy!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|its fun if only u didn't have to log into fb to add friends because I don't have facebook and choose not to have it.....it would get 4 stars
B00536OCYG|5.0|For those who own The Wall in their original vinyl pressing, or on the various CD releases since the 1980s, let me tell you that this 180 gram vinyl remastering is by far the BEST audio version I've heard of this album. The 180 gram LPs I bought came from the UK, a country that in my humble opinion, along with the Japanese and the Germans, manufacture the best quality vinyl in the world. The vinyl is extremely quiet and the sound is full - meaning it's neither bassy nor  \\"tinny\\" - it is well balanced and I hear instruments previously buried in the early LP pressings and in the CDs. Though you can adjust your tone controls to your liking - set mine on flat - you can still hear the 15kHz tone from the TV in the track \\"One Of My Turns\\". Highly recommended if you can afford it. And if you can't, put it on the credit card before they're all gone and then end up on auction sites for a 3 digit sum.
B005K17RU0|4.0|When I learned that my Android phone needed to be upgraded, I was fine with that. When I found out that the upgrade deleted AccuWeather, I was SO upset because I depended on that to give me a forecast for the four places I travel to most. Seeing the free app on Amazon was a relief. AccuWeather is great because not only does it give detailed info about the weather in whatever city you choose, the background changes from day to night. I could not do without this app!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun and entertaining. keeps you busy for hours. like all of these type games on facebook and enjoy that I can takethem on the go with my kindle fire.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible app.  I love that it has so many versions. Its so easy to check different versions to give me a better understanding of the word of God. I'd like to say thanks to the people that put this all together. Thanks :)
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|after resenting my kindle due to the game,all the timings got screwdriver up.You have to wait 150 hrs to collect money and ur energy drained to 0.
0545265355|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy Boxed Set arrived in perfect condition and very quickly.  I was very pleased with this order.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|the game is ....... meh. But the daily alert on my phone to come back to play are not only creepy but also annoying. I did not realize I was going to be alerted when I didn't play the game. uninstalled and I do not recommend.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The book is suspenseful and held my interest throughout. I would describe the story as apocolyptic and associate it as to how depraved human activity can become without God in their lives.  Maybe class it as science fiction.
B007APG9NU|5.0|OMG! I Abso Heart this Album. I bought the clean version and I play it everyday in my car. My fave tracks are #11, 7,8,9,14,15, But the entire album bangs best artist debut of the year in my opinion!
B0038P59A0|4.0|Fun and suspenseful film. Look forward to watching second part of this movie. I would recommend, price isn't bad either for a rental in the convenience of your own home. Wouldn't do it often, but since Redbox didn't have it.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|this game has beautiful graphics and wonderful music. even though I have this game on the ipod and my HTC Evo, I still got it again, paying the three bucks, because I never tire of playing this game, and because the game is even better with the fire's larger screen.

030758836X|5.0|This powerful story begins with Nick Dunne and his wife, Amy, in their days as newlyweds in Brooklyn, New York.<br /><br />They seem relatively happy and the type of characters that readers can relate to. Then their jobs are lost when magazines begin eliminating positions due to the economic downturn.<br /><br />Nick gets a message from his twin sister Margo, nicknamed, \\"Go.\\"  She was back in Nick's hometown of North Carthridge, Missouri, caring for their parents, whose health was deteriorating.<br /><br />To help his sister and have something positive to do, he moves back to Missouri, against Amy's wishes.<br /><br />He opens a bar and is well respected in his hometown. In the meanwhile, Amy increases her resentment. Nick is getting all of the attention and she doesn't like that she's had to move away from the creative atmosphere of New York.<br /><br />On their fifth anniversary, Amy disappears.<br /><br />There is an initial outpouring of sympathy for Nick but as law enforcement begins looking into his story, his innocence comes into question.<br /><br />In alternating chapters we read of Amy's diary and see their relationship falling apart. Then we read that Amy was sick of being the 'good wife' and had something in mind. She becomes transformed from \\"Amazing Amy,\\" to a woman who catches her husband doing something wrong and wants revenge. In the other chapters, we see Nick's reaction to his wife's disappearance and begins to see what is really happening, but can he get anyone to believe him?<br /><br />Who to blame?  The author does an excellent job of describing the fault of both parties and lets us see how it changes their lives.
B005HV6Y5W|1.0|Let's keep this short and sweet..I love daring movies, I love experimental movies, I love mysterious movies.<br />I hated this movie. Hate may be too strong, I despise this movie because it pretended to be intellectual and artistic when it was actually mundane and stole everything from Earth Documentaries and actaul artistic art films from 20+ years ago. A little late Malick.
0553807919|5.0|I hesitated to pick up The Whole Brain Child, because I was worried that it would focus too much on overly-specific scientific studies (even if they were interesting) and not enough on practical advice. However, after reading it, my doubts are completely laid to rest.<br /><br />This book really does live up to its title; the strategies provided have actually been revolutionary to my way of parenting. I feel like I understand my young children so much better now. I loved the simple, yet thorough, discussions about the functions of our left and right, and upper and lower, brains. I loved the extremely applicable examples given on how to better engage your child in the midst of an intense \\"teaching\\" moment.<br /><br />And I especially loved the tone of the book overall. The authors don't take a black and white approach to parenting. They emphasize that our job as parents is to help our kids understand and process their feelings using the under-developed tools they have available. This is an ongoing process, something we help them achieve over long periods of time. Kids don't become mature and highly-functioning people in a moment, and they aren't scarred for life if we don't coach them through a tough, emotionally-charged situation in a less-than-stellar way. It sounds like common sense, but, for me, it felt very forgiving. I was happy to read that one bad day--or even a few bad days--wasn't going to ruin my kid or my relationship with him.<br /><br />In short, this was an excellent read, and I feel like I have gained skills to help me be a better parent.
B0019NG73G|4.0|For the very first time on Blu Ray this long movie has made its debut with extra time.<br />The picture is fine for me, not a GREAT quality but it's fine, decent image plus DTS HD Sound.<br />The package is nice wit an extra disc.<br />I liked the a lot
B005HSG3TC|3.0|I like the sturdiness of the cover but had issues with the band.  It snapped on us after about a month.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book had me from the first page.  The storyline was fast moving and it kept you guessing all the time.  I couldn't put it down.  Even up to the surprise ending, you're not sure if Jacob is innocent or guilty.  I wish the book could have been a little longer so you could find out for sure.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys mystery and suspense.  It will definitely keep your attention from beginning to end.

B005C9YZIW|3.0|ALTHOUGH I DID NOT PURCHASE THIS SERIES THROUGH AMAZON (Best Buy), I WOULD LIKE TO INFORM YOU BEFORE YOU BUY THIS THAT IT IS NOT IN FULL HD, AND SOME CLIPS ARE IN 480.<br />ALMOST 85 PERCENT OF THIS SERIES IS IN 720p, AND ALTHOUGH IT BOSTS 1080i, YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT 1080i IS NEARLY THE SAME AS 720p.  720p IS NOT FULL HD AND IS STILL CLEAR.  JUST DON'T LET 1080i FOOL YOU INTO THINKING THAT IT IS 1080P.  I WAS VERY SATISFIED WITH THIS SERIOUS, AND WATCHED IT ON MY TV, WHICH DISPLAYS IN 1080P, 240hz, LED, AND 6,000,000 CONTRAST.  SO I GUESS YOU CAN SAY THAT I GOT AS GOOD VIEWING EXPERIENCE THAT THERE IS POSSIBLE.  THE POLAR BEAR SCENE WAS A DOWNER, BUT IT IS PROBABLY THAT THE FILM CREW WHO SHOT THAT SCENE DID NOT HAVE THE BEST EQUIPMENT.  DO NOT LET THAT DISCOURAGE YOU.  IT WAS ONLY THE FIRST DISC OF THE SERIES, AND IT DOES IMPROVE FORM THERE.  I AM A BIG FAN OF BBC, AND WHAT I WOULD RECOMMEND IS THAT THEY LOWER THE PRICE, SINCE IT IS NOT FULL HD

145210655X|5.0|When looking at the pictures in the preview, I was sold on this book, but not for my son. I ended up buying it for my wife. Looked through it today and it's great, really adorable artwork. Don't buy if you're looking for a story to read your little kid, but for a mom or dad, this is just great. Like the other reviewers said, it's more of a gift book than anything else, but as a gift book for a parent it's fantastic.

B005TZFZJC|3.0|Rihanna makes me fidgety. I feel something for her that could be described either as intense romantic infatuation or perplexed dread. Or maybe intense romantic dread.<br /><br />Here's the issue: On the one hand, her notes often emit a genuine sensuality that feels so cherry-ringing true. On the other hand, her lyrics often make a cheap play to the 12-year-old mp3-buying segment by offering, for example, cheers to the freakin weekend, as if she in her millionaire music-industry status has a freakin weekend that she eagerly anticipates. (I won't drink to that.)<br /><br />The issue, I think, is that I can't tell what Rihanna's intentions are. What is she trying to create? Art or commerce? Expression or commodity?<br /><br />If it's art/expression, it's not terribly high on depth or complexity. In other words, it's not the type of stuff that gets critics excited. But it can still get me excited as long as it's honest, as long as she *feels* what she creates, as long as she creates her music asking what feels true or right or good rather than what's likely to earn $$ or chart position.<br /><br />But then I wonder if I'm giving her too much credit. Is it even right to say that \\"she\\" creates \\"her\\" music, or is she just the frontwoman of Clear Channel Broadcasting, Inc. et al.? And that's why Rihanna's music makes me fidgety, because I'm not even sure I'm listening to \\"Rihanna.\\"
B005GFPZYK|5.0|If you like war stories or want to know what really goes on in the Middle East then this is your book. More info about how things happen and why than I have read in the past ten years of newspapers. In tough time we need tough people and this is one guy I would serve with anywhere in the world. If you wonder about our military readiness, you might want to try this one out. Well written and a good read.
1905113161|5.0|This book should still be available for people to buy, through Amazon. If you have a chance to get it at a reasonable price, please don't pass up the chance. It is a beautiful instructional manual for Royal icing and how to take it to the next level. It may not be for the absolute begginer but it will inspire you to pipe and to make your own creations. And you may not jump into piping R.I. right away but when you do you will not regret that you have this gorgeous encyclopedia. This book is a job excellently done. Bravo Eddie Spence! Enjoy.

B006PHD0RW|5.0|fun and challenging - I have been addicted since I started... it gets tough to get more levels unlocked as you go on.. so if u get stuck it can be frustrating!  I finally got past a few more now.  I needed a new game- and this seems to have done the trick!
B0055S348W|5.0|I absolutely love this app!! I have had it for over a year and I use it quite often. I've printed many receipts from websites, documents, but mostly I use it for pictures. I load my printer with photo paper and I'm ready to go. There are many adjustments in the app for photo size, orientation, border, etc. This is by far the best printing app on Android, and better than any of the apps on Apple!! This app is worth much more than the price in my opinion, and is a must have for EVERY mobile device!! I use it on my Evo 3D and Transformer Prime, flawless on both
0525423656|5.0|I enjoyed this book even more than the first book in the series Matched. I can't wait until the next book is released.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|fun! just like super nintendo. for me; its way more entertaining than angry birds. I'm glad I found it. I would recommend. this app for sure!
0061146307|4.0|This is a really nasty little book. Unabashedly so. The orphans, Violet, Klaus and Sunny are subjected to unfortunate events at every turn...exactly what the title promises! The children are brilliant characters as each has their own identity and their own quirks; Violet is an inventor, Klaus a reader and Sunny likes to bite people. This is a small thing, but I liked how the boy was the reader and the girl the inventor; normally that would be the other way around because of the usual gender stereotypes. It was nice to see that inverted. I loved the relationship between the orphans as well; they look out for each other and don't fight and bicker their way through the whole book as you sometimes get in children's books. Sunny was probably my favourite orphan as she is only a baby but has such a great spirit and provides most of the comic relief in the book.<br /><br />Count Olaf is a brilliant villain. He, and his motley crew of sinister misfits, rival Captain Hook and Cruella de Vil for pure unadulterated evil. There is no reason to like the Count at all, so you hate him with a passion. I like characters you can really sink your teeth into and properly hate- it's like being at a pantomime and booing every time the villain takes to the stage. He treats the children with complete cruelty and disregard, and subjects them to filthy conditions, physical abuse and slave duties. Whenever children are involved there is always a question of paedophilic undertones, and certain events and instances in the book do make you squirm in discomfort...such as the Count caressing Violet's face on a few occasions. It only adds to your feeling of desperately wanting to help the orphans and makes you feel even more tense about the potential threat posed by the Count.<br /><br />What I think I really loved most about this book was how it reminded me of books I used to read when I was younger. I adore Roald Dahl and I always remember my Grandma saying to me, 'You shouldn't read those, they always have a nasty streak'. I couldn't tell her that that's why I loved them. I like books where people die and bad things happen and there is a villain of the piece; my favourite book was always Matilda. I like macabre and dark humour, and Lemony Snicket really knows how to do that really well for children. He doesn't patronise them and assume that they want rose gardens and cuddly bears and happy endings. The children in the book are treated with respect by Snicket in that they face real, adult problems and handle them exquisitely. Adults are useless in this book. Not only the Count and his minions, but even their lawyer Mr Poe who ignores their pleas for help and their neighbour Justice Strauss who is too naive to notice their abuse are ineffectual. Even their dead parents, whose Will prevents them from being adopted by someone who isn't a relative, are hindering them. The children have to use their own resources and creativity despite these stupid grown-ups; in the same way that Harry Potter and characters in most Enid Blyton books do. Adults are so caught up in small domestic problems that they ignore the real issues right in front of them.<br /><br />There was only one thing which didn't work for me in this book. I generally don't like to criticise children's books too harshly as I feel I am not their target audience, and what doesn't work for me might work for a child. However, I wasn't a fan of the word definitions that were slipped into the story as I felt they interrupted the flow of the narrative, and were sometimes even a little confusing. Saying that, I can imagine they would be handy if you were reading this story aloud to children as it would clarify hard words for them and maybe even expand their vocabulary.<br /><br />Overall, this book was everything I was expecting and a little bit more. It was well written and memorable, with an outrageously evil villain living in a sprawling run-down Gothic mansion. I know I would have loved these books as a child, and I would definitely recommend these books to any children I meet in the future!ild, and I would definitely recommend these books to any children I meet in the future!
B004W4N55C|1.0|This is a great app but it needs support for phones with ICS (Android 4.0) It works great on other devices. Should be an easy fix, but they haven't fixed it.
B00634GHJA|5.0|works as it should. use it to transfer pictures from my phone to my pc and vice versa. works great.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I decided that I needed to read this book before seeing the movie so that I would know what it's all about and let's just say I'm hooked! This book draws you in and doesn't let go.
0451228375|4.0|Fairly interesting, especially from a historical point of view, really really long. Interesting to see how people lived in this time period.
0545123275|4.0|This book was really adorable. I loved Grace and Sam and their story. It was like 'Beauty and the Beast'...but instead of a selfish brute in a lonely mansion, we got a lovely, bookshop-working, raven-haired, yellow-eyed piece of man candy. The narrative alternates between Sam and Grace's point of view, which is something I think really works in romantic stories as it lets you know how each person feels about the other, and doesn't make it seem as though one just really obsessed with the other! It also accentuated the differences between the characters, which was an aspect I really loved. Sam is sensitive and really into poetry and song lyrics and wears his heart on his sleeve...whereas Grace is stoic and unemotional and finds it hard to express herself. I loved that yin/yang aspect of their relationship; it made it much more believable and I could really relate to it from my own experiences!<br /><br />I also liked the whole host of secondary characters and their relationships with Grace and Sam. I especially liked the way neither Grace nor Sam had perfect relationships with their friends and family, as it became a strong bond that they shared. Grace's parents are pretty useless and pay little attention to their daughter. Although they live in the same house, they lead very different lives and her mum and dad seem to shut themselves up in their studio/office and barely say a word to her or seem at all concerned about her. Sam's parents...well...the less said about them the better. Let's just say they took some pretty gruesome drastic measures when they found out their son was a werewolf. I think these relationships help to explain why Grace and Sam have always clung to the idea of each other; despite not knowing each other at all for years before they meet, they watch each other and feel protective of each other. They wanted unconditional love and believed the other person was a way to get it; thankfully, they were right.<br /><br />I also really liked Grace's troubled relationship with her friend Olivia at the beginning of the book. The way Grace felt, as though her friend was slipping away as they got older, and that she was having to work harder and harder to remain close to her friend, was very realistic. I think we've all been in that position where we have been friends with someone for years and then one day realise that we're not sure why we're friends with them anymore. Friends drift apart, especially when you're Grace and you don't have much time for the trivial worries of your friends when all you can think about is staring at a wolf on your back porch.<br /><br />I really loved the setting of this book. I wasn't keen on the name 'Mercy Falls' because it seemed a bit...tacky and lame but I love the woods and how much the woods featured in the book. They were dark and twisted and mysterious and seemed to enfold the characters and houses within them. I like how Grace's feelings towards Sam are projected onto the woods as well; she gazes at them longingly and dreams of living under the golden leaves just as she dreams of Sam himself. The woods are transformed because she always waited for the wolves and wanted to live amongst them, and I think it was what made Sam really familiar to her when she finally saw him in human form- he smelt like the woods and they were a part of both of them.<br /><br />I really liked the emphasis on smell in this novel, too. Grace has an element of wolf in her since she was bitten as a child so, with the prompting of Sam, she gives in to her wolf-heightened sense of smell- a scene in a sweetshop was one of my favourites in the whole book. A lot of the sensuality between Grace and Sam came from them inhaling each others scents, and finding safety and security in the familarity of each other's smell. I loved this as it was very primitive and animalistic as well as being rather sweet and unique.<br /><br />However, I did dislike some aspects of the book. This isn't the most complex of novels, and there is a lot of repetition of similes and metaphors throughout. There are no radical ideas or anything particularly original: there are no huge problems when Grace, a girl who has dreamt about a particular wolf/boy since she was little, finally has her dreams made a reality; he is everything she wanted and dreamed of. I thought it would be more interesting if, initially, she found it hard to reconcile the two ideas she had had of this boy and had more of a hard time getting to know him. But I guess that wouldn't have been as romantic, which is one of the purposes of the book.<br /><br />Another little thing I had a bit of a problem with was something I know my best friend would've hated if she had been reading this book: the focus on eyes. In young adult fiction, there is a tendency to focus on looks and eyes because it is less erotic and sexual then focusing on bodies and body language. Instead, the characters 'read' each others eyes and expressions and observe other characters emotions through looks in their eyes. This gets a bit annoying as it is pretty unrealistic...how often can you say you have read something just from someone's eyes!? It takes the whole face at least!<br /><br />I also found Sam's song lyrics pretty cheesy. I know some people love all the deep and meaningful stuff but, for me, the song lyrics were a step too far. I could handle him reading her poetry. I could handle him calling her 'angel' (even though I did cringe). But beyond that I did find myself smirking at the cheese...especially because Grace isn't the kind of character who you would think would appreciate that sort of smushy-ness!<br /><br />Despite the few down sides, I did really, really enjoy this book. It was cute and did choke me up a little in places! I really believed in the characters, as I felt they were multi-dimensional and more complex than average. I will definitely be reading the sequel!nd there is a lot of repetition of similes and metaphors throughout.

0741470314|5.0|This book was a very well written defense of a talented , kind, generous and loving celebrity who was tormented by the media.  It is very disturbing to me that we live in a society that hungers to destroy a person that has achieved stardom and recognition because of genuine talent.  This book was so needed to tell the good things about MJ without the intent to benefit  financially from the effort.  Dr. Moriarty clearly spent an incredible amount of time researching and checking her facts before publication.  Motivated to do the right thing, she worked with little interruption to achieve the goal of portraying MJ as the kind and gentle human being that he was. She worked hard because she wanted the truth told.<br />Any reviews to the contrary are, in my opinion, written by people that do not want to know all the facts before placing judgment or cannot tell the difference between truth and garbage that is written to \\"sell\\" magazines, books, TV news, etc.  A well informed person will read everything they can find from many sources before making a judgment about a person or an issue.<br />Dr. Moriarty should be praised for her endeavor.  This is a great book with incredible insight into the life of The King of Pop,  offset by the sickness of many who manipulated him, financially used him and tried to destroy him.
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|Enjoyed reading this, seems to be a lot of sense therein. Have certainly been a bit more conscious of what I'm eating since. Def worth a read.

0439023513|2.0|I am so upset and saddened by the ridiculous Mockingjay playout. I feel like I was lured in by Hunger Games & Catching Fire only to be put in a bubble and shut out from Mockingjay. It was as if the main characters were stripped of their \\"real\\" selves. Did Collins forget who she was writing about?<br /> Aside from the tremendous amount of non-realistic violence in this book Katniss practically lives in an injured and drug induced fog during almost the entire thing. She doesn't make any real connections with anyone and is constantly injured and coming in and out of consciousness. Gale doesn't stand by her or even act like he's half interested in her more than once or maybe twice in the entire book. Peeta is never himself, either. He goes from being the sweet loving boy to a crazed maniac. This book is full of senseless and illogical violence, depressing lives, lost characters, and no love at all. It's incredibly depressing and I'm sick that I wasted my time on these books. I will NEVER read or recommend any of Collins' books to anyone again! Starting today.

Just makes you curious if someones opened it, but that's just an observation. The board handles great, I was skeptical about going with another gigabyte board after my ga-970-ud3 came with dead DIMM slots.<br />It was so aggravating because you wouldn't think that all 4 slots could be bad, i spent so much time fiddling around with the memory and thought it was the memory. Back to the board though, the board is great and well built. The pci slots are awesome, and the SATA ports are great for cable management but can be an annoyance in some cases. What I found to do was is if you can't plug one in because of the tightness, try and plug in the cable to whichever slot before you screw in the board. Dolby Surround sound is an excellent feature and compliments my Logitech z-5500 very well! Hell, I went from an ABIT an52(now out of business) to this, and I see that my internet speeds have even improved. I'm guessing the fact that the drivers I had were like from '05 since they stopped production and i couldn't find drivers for squat.<br /><br />Gigabyte did a great job, but only time will tell.<br /><br />10/10 for now.
B005LAIGSM|3.0|I watched this movie because I liked the two main stars and since they were doing a movie together - I had to watch it! I seen a lot of chick flicks before and this one isn't as good as the others.<br /><br />The story line is pretty good. Leo and Pagie gets into a car accident and Leo is fine, but Pagie has lost her memory. But, she only lost her memory up till a certain point in her life. She doesn't remember Leo, who is her husband. What she does remember is that she just about to go to Law School and she was with her old BF at the time. Pagie gives a shot to live with Leo and not with her parents, which she original wanted to do. But, after Leo convinced her and her parents that it's the better choice to come live with him because she could get her memory back that way. So, Pagie goes lives with Leo. Leo shows Pagie how she was when he was with her and that doesn't go too well. She ends up acting like her old pass self, which Leo has never met. To Leo, this is like a whole different person.<br /><br />Now Leo wants to give this old Pagie a shot. He believes that if he could make the old Pagie fall in love with him, maybe the Pagie he knew will come back out. This doesn't go exactly how he wanted and they end divorced afterwards. They both then try to live their own lives without each other.<br /><br />Eventually, Pagie starts to realized how come she changed so much from the old Pagie that Leo knew. She realized that she hated her parants and that she hated her old BF too. Pagie decides to leave her old life behind and build yet another new life. Leo doesn't knows this and continue on living without her and doing his own thing.<br /><br />This is the kicker. Now, somehow, since this is a love story movie, these two meet each other at the end of the movie again. They decided to give it another shot. Pagie never got her memory back, but still gives hope that it will all work out at the end.<br /><br />I believe this movie had all the right pieces to be a great movie, it just wasn't executed well enough to make me want to give it a higher rating. I didn't believe those two were in love on in their love scenes. These two didn't take me away and want to care for them. I wasn't happy or sad when they were together or when they left. I was confused how they ended up together at the very end. Sure, I was entertained but not too much.<br /><br />So I say, you can watch this movie, but I don't recommend it as a buy.
B003CNQPNS|4.0|Another show from the 80's that was really cool to watch was StreetHawk. This was the only show to really challange Knight Rider. Let's look at the similarities- Jesse Mach was a beat motorcycle cop until a tragic injury got him to work for the government to ride a super-powered motorcyle named \\"StreetHawk\\" where he and a government desk agent, Norman Tuttle work together. Micheal Long had a tragic near death experience which caused him to change his name (and his face) to Micheal Knight. Micheal is drafted in to work with a agency-like government organization known as FLAG (Foundation for Law And Government)to drive a super-powered sportscar named The Knight Industries Two Thousand (K.I.T.T.)Both solve cases and help people, the only difference is that StreetHawk doesn't talk like KITT and Jesse Mach is the secret identity of StreetHawk. I personally think if StreetHawk stayed on long enough, it would have been a better show than Knight Rider. After a while people would have got tired of watching a talking car. This maybe why the new Knight Rider show of 2008 didn't last long. The T.V. movie was great but the show wasn't as good. On StreetHawk, Norman would use a super-computer to help Jesse ride through traffic and tell him where to go when riding the bike. Just image if that show was on today with the internet and all. The writers of the show may want to think about an updated movie version of StreetHawk. It would be really cool by now with the internet. But due to T.V. politics and Monday Night Football at the time the show only lasted one season. Maybe the real reason StreetHawk got canceled because deep down inside the writers of Knight Rider knew StreetHawk was the only show to challange the popular show back then.

B000RZIGVS|3.0|The product itself is fine.  The discs work and they contain what they should. The packaging they come in however, couldn't be more cheap.  The discs are stored in a flimsy green plastic, open faced cases that hold two discs each.  The cases are are then stacked and taped together, the tape being the only thing that keeps the discs together as a set.  Plus the clips that hold the discs to the cases are difficult to get the discs out of and more often than not just break off leaving you with no way to keep the discs in the case.  My recommendation is do not pay retail price for this set and purchase your own cases to store the discs in.
0345803485|1.0|After all the hype, I decided to go get the infamous \\"50 Shades of Grey.\\" I lasted only 40 pages before chucking in the garbage. It was horribly written, with the main character droning on & on about her inner feelings & biting her stupid bottom lip.  It's just a glorified harlequin romance with some soft porn, totally God awful.<br /><br />Get yourself a good book, like The Hunger Games, and don't bother with this trite, poorly written excuse for a book.

B005HI4LMS|4.0|\\"Tucker & Dale vs Evil\\" is a comedy and horror and - believe me or not - romance rolled into one. The Canadian-American film is an instant cult classic like the 80s Sam Raimi films starring great Bruce Campbell. It has interesting characters, clever (and crazy) jokes and capable acting, but its approach to the subject matter is rather an orthodox one.<br /><br />The film, first-time directed and co-written by Eli Craig, is about Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine), two good-natured guys mistaken for \\"cannibalistic mountain people\\" by college students. When Dale saves Allison (Katrina Bowden), who fell into the river, these students, who must have seen \\"Wrong Turn\\" and \\"The Hills Have Eyes,\\" jump to the conclusion: she is being kidnapped! Led by Chad (Jesse Moss), who obviously has some reason to be enthusiastic, the students attempt to \\"rescue\\" Allison. Of course, their mission goes terribly wrong.<br /><br />Part satire and part slapstick, \\"Tucker & Dale vs Evil\\" makes a good use of familiar horror movie elements - a rundown cabin in the woods, a chainsaw-wielding killer, etc. - and turn them into blood-soaked gags. Those jokes may lose their humor if overdone, but the film quickly moves on before this happens, wrapping the story up in a more conventional but satisfactory way.<br /><br />To me, the most impressive thing about the film is characters, especially Tucker and Dale, a horror version of Laurel and Hardy. Well-meaning Allison and her therapy session is also nice.

B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I am very excited to see this on kindle and think it should also be extended to all android devices. The gameplay is as smooth as my itouch, but I found one major flaw, major to me at least. It tells me notifications are not supported on my devise, when all of my other kindle specific apps send me notifications no problem. Maybe you should have tinkered with them to make sure they worked on the devise you specifically released this game on.
B0070TDERU|5.0|This series is well acted and the setting and costumes accurate. The pace keeps you engrossed....never dull.  I am looking forward to the next season.
B005NQ5LSC|3.0|An \\"Ip Man\\" film without Donnie Yen? You may be thinking such a project will end up with terrible results. In fact, flawed as it is, \\"Ip Man: The Legend is Born\\" is not that bad, thanks to the capable cast including Dennis To and Fan Siu-wong, as well as supports from familiar faces from Hong Kong cinema such as Yuen Biao, Lam Suet and Sammo Hung in a cameo role.<br /><br />In \\"Ip Man: The Legend is Born,\\" Dennis To (also known as Yu-Hang To) plays the legendary martial arts fighter and master of Bruce Lee. The film chronicles his young days in early 20th century Foshan, where he meets his future wife Cheung Wing-shing (Huang Yi), and Hong Kong, where he learns a new fighting style from another Wing Chun master (played by Ip Chun, Ip Man's real-life son).<br /><br />Dennis To (with physical resemblance to Donnie Yen) is credible as young Ip Man. Action sequences are competent, but not as innovative as those of other two \\"Ip Man\\" movies starring Donnie Yen, who always adds something new to the choreography. One exception is a brief but impressive sparring scene by Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao (both blindfolded), but the rest of the martial arts stunts lacks style or power Donnie Yen might have brought in.<br /><br />The story is weak and sometimes incomprehensible, and the production design looks not very authentic. I don't mind these things anyway because what I want is action. \\"Ip Man: The Legend is Born\\" tries its best, but after our watching the two Donnie Yen features, the new film's action is just adequate.

B0034G4P4Y|3.0|Stunning and fast moving, this movie really takes off. It captures the characters well but I have to admit it was a Sunday paper cartoon that I vaguely remember and seeing it didn't jog much memory. Still, I will get a chance to watch it as much as I like and perhaps I will see much more that I may have missed on the first viewing. I do feel this movie is directed at a younger audience between 10 and 15 years of age.
0756405890|5.0|One word:<br /><br />EPIC!<br /><br />This came as a recommendation through ARMADILLOCON, a local SFF literary con held yearly here in Austin. And, so, I've started this new thing where most of my audio book listens are adult SFF (my original love), and most of my paper/ebook reads are kid and teen books. So I opted for this as my next audiobook listen, and was hooked from the first page.<br /><br />Five reasons to pick this book up TODAY:<br /><br />1) Like I mentioned, I listened to this on audio. If it says anything about how much I enjoyed the book, it was 25 hours long. As soon as I finished it, I bought and downloaded the sequel which is 45 hours long.<br /><br />2) The book is truly episodic. And yet, it hooked me completely. It's told as a story, and I found myself sucked right in, feeling like I was right there in the inn as it unfolded.<br /><br />3) I love that the main character, Kvothe, is so talented and yet so imperfect. He's not proud of his mistakes, but he's also not afraid to admit to them, and he shows them to the reader in the most humorous (or sometimes the most touching) ways.<br /><br />4) The character interplay is beautifully done. Kvothe meets so many different people and finds himself in so many different situations, and in each one, the relationships with the people he meets are constructed and displayed so well. It's fun and light and dark and deep, and everything I'd like to be able to do in my writing.<br /><br />5) The world Patrick Rothfuss has created is a world I can totally lose myself in. I'm about halfway through the sequel, and I'm already waiting for book 3 so I can spend just a little bit more time in this world. Everything from the idioms to the monetary system to the rankings of musicians and the songs are well thought out, and even though amazing details are given to describe and show all these things, never does it feel burdensome or clunky.<br /><br />Overall, this is a book I highly recommend to anyone who loves adult fantasy and science fiction. This is fantasy at its very best. No, it's not a kids' book. And sure, the material is fine suited for teens, but this is truly an epic fantasy and is a true pleasure for those who love that sort of thing.<br /><br />From Amazon:<br /><br />This is the riveting first-person narrative of Kvothe, a young man who grows to be one of the most notorious magicians his world has ever seen. From his childhood in a troupe of traveling players, to years spent as a near-feral orphan in a crime-riddled city, to his daringly brazen yet successful bid to enter a legendary school of magic, The Name of the Wind is a masterpiece that transports readers into the body and mind of a wizard.<br /><br />Source of book: Purchased audiobook from Audible.comfantasy and science fiction.

B000AOJ9X0|5.0|I am constantly amazed by Buddy Guy.  Having just seen him performing live at the age of 76, he was around 70 when he recorded this.  But the bluesman is truly timeless - no joke.  Instead of tossing off cliches and 3 chords, the man is giving us INCREDIBLE music.  The soulfulness (it's more soul than raw blues) of the album is Amazing.  But of course, the collaborations with Carlos Santana, Tracy Chapman, John Mayer, etc gives this album an extra polish.<br /><br />I especially like that this is a BUDDY GUY album - not some hodge podge of \\"star duets\\" or jams.  This is really good stuff.  Smouldering!<br /><br />Can't help the superlatives, but the man lives up to his legend.  And there are so few living legends left in the world of music, let alone from Buddy Guy's era.  Here's to Buddy giving us more years of music.
1609984021|4.0|I read Little Women as a girl and loved it so I was excited to have the opportunity to review an audio production of the book. However, I was quite surprised when the audio book abruptly ended in the middle of the story. I discovered that Little Women was originally two volumes: Little Women and Good Wives. They were first published together as one book titled Little Women in 1880. Most versions of Little Women published today are both volumes together in one book. This audio recording is just the first volume. Because what most people read as Little Women is actually both volumes, I feel like there should have been some indication on the box somewhere that this audio book does not include the second volume.<br /><br />(I don't want to spoil it for anyone who may not have read it yet so I'll say this - remember the Friends episode when Rachel convinces Joey to read Little Women? And he has to put the book in the freezer because of one particularly sad part? This audiobook ends before that sad part happens.)<br /><br />Even though this book was written more than one-hundred years ago, it still has relevance today. I think that the four March girls and Marmee have some good lessons to teach young girls that are timeless. Reading it now as a mother myself, I marveled at Marmee's patience and wisdom. I could learn a lot from her! I was very impressed at how independent and free-thinking the girls and their mother were given the time period the book was written in and took place. (Of course, Louisa May Alcott was a Unitarian so I shouldn't have been surprised at that.)<br /><br />Lorelei King narrated this audio book. I thought she did a great job for the most part. The two voices I didn't like were Beth and Amy's. I thought Beth's was too breathy and Amy's was too babyish - they didn't sound realistic to me. Overall, I enjoyed this audio production. My biggest complaint is that it left unexpectedly hanging at the end.

1439102813|5.0|I am not going into the details of the style of writting or details of the book like most reviewers do, I just want to say it was a very inciteful book for someone dealing with a loved one with Alzheimers. She describes the different feelings of Alice, family and friends. While I knew of the prgression to expect it would be helpful to those not familiar with this horrid condition. I highly recommend it and will donate it to our Church library for our parish nurse to use.

B0078YXF4Y|2.0|This moving was very slow, you had to watch very closely or you would miss the story line.  No surprises for me.  Granted, I did not know about the movie, if I had, I would not have rented it.  The description of the movie before renting was not efficient to describe the movie.
0312370849|5.0|I loved this novel because it really showed the power of love -- young sisterly love and romantic love.  We meet Sarah, a 10-year old girl, as her story is told in her words during the Holocaust. We meet Julia, an adult woman inexplicably and strongly drawn to Sarah and her story.  What results is a cleansing experience for Julia and the birth of two new loves.  I loved these characters, who were aptly drawn with just the right amount of description and character development.  This novel will hold your attention without screaming \\"don't put me down!\\" -- an interesting and very satisfying read.
B0058Z4NR8|3.0|I listened to an interview with the authors on NPR and right away I had to have it.<br /><br />Their main thesis is a wealth-of-nations thing where the nations that are well off have inclusive institutions and other nations have extractive institutions.<br /><br />It sounded great. I had to agree with some of it, and there were new historical anecdotes.<br /><br />But as I read on I began to feel like I had been suckered.  It was actually a libertarian tract intent on pushing property rights and denigrating the usual suspects--like when I thought Kiss of the Spider Woman was going to be science fiction.<br /><br />However, you'll probably want to read it for yourself.  If you do, just keep asking yourself a few questions: Why do they keep saying the same things over and over? Why isn't anything falsifiable? Why aren't there any statistics? Why are so many things that ought to be supported by evidence rather stated as facts?<br /><br />They go to some trouble to denigrate Guns, Germs, and Steel, but it's a better book and if you haven't read it, it would profit you more than this one.
0756991145|3.0|Set in the civil war on the Isle of Bougainville (near Papua New Guinea), this book is narrated by 14 year old Matilda. At first she is only affected by the mass exodus of her teachers...until local eccentric Mr Watts steps in as a volunteer. The only white man left, he focusses his students' minds on Dickens' 'Great Expectations'; and invites their parents to school to share their thoughts on life.<br />As the fighting starts to touch the village, Mr Watts' storytelling, based around Great Expectations, temporarily- and improbably- holds off the soldiers. But Matilda has to face dark times...<br />I really enjoyed the ending of the book, thought Jones brought it together well in a satisfying way. But the main body of the book failed to grab me. Maybe it would be better targetted at the adolescent reader. I didn't find Matilda at all convincing and even when certain events happen I didn't experience the jolt I would have expected.

B0041KKYGU|3.0|i never thought cd was anything too look at but then again, i'm a female. one thing i do think she excels at is comedic acting. she is freaking hi-larious in this film. justin timberlake is just as good in his role. the casting was spot on for every character.<br /><br />the overall message however is extremely immoral which made it fall flat in the end. this woman does all sorts of really mean and crappy things (albeit funny) but is never called on it. ever. the annoying but innocent coworker gets the shaft. i ended up feeling sorry for her.<br /><br />not a good message for the young folks.

B00005JKLZ|4.0|This movie is sort of fun during the first hour, but the ending is just so disappointing. It would have been better to have followed the story a little more closely. The vampire super-intellectual monster guy (Irons) was a curve ball that was totally out of place. The film clearly suffers from losing it's director before it was completed, since the new director did not do much more than just blow everything up and roll the credits. Taking the story into causality does not do justice to the original H.G. Wells novel. There are plenty of time travel stories out there; if you're going to do Wells, do it accurately, not as a revisionist story.<br /><br />The second major problem with the film is the casting of the protagonist, and it sort of fails clear to the end. Guy Pearce is a good actor, but he does certain roles really well, not others not so well. This was not a good role for him; he's not believable as an engineer or physicist, let alone a tinkerer. Where Pearce works really well is wearing a uniform (a character of a character). He doesn't pull off a believable character on his own very well.<br /><br />The main reason I watch this film every so often is for a very exotic Samantha Mumba--who has, sadly, not done another film. She was a natural choice for a tropical native girl. And, I thought the village on the cliff was more interesting than the temple-like structure of the original film.<br /><br />I found the special effects to be sub-par but effective. The Morlocks were better as slower-moving bipeds rather than beastly creatures that run and jump like tigers. The original film (and novel) was quite scary with slow-moving Morlocks, so there was no need to make them fast-moving, hot-blooded beasts.<br /><br />Fans will want to be sure to read Stephen Baxter's novel, \\"The Time Ships\\", for a further treatment of this character.
B007SGM084|5.0|Think about it folks.. you have a paperback or a hard cover book.. or something digital.. hmmm which one will last longer?  which one is more mobile?  which one is more convenient?  That's why the digital versions are more expensive than what's originally published.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Even as a female this show still appealed to me. There is tons of violence, nudity (both male and female), and lots of coarse language, but none of that bothered me in the slightest. The story line is very engaging and doesn't leave for a dull moment. Spartacus from the second episode in, draws in the viewer and keeps them engaged all the way to the end. Personally, I was admittedly almost turned off from this show just by the first episode. It was over the top with the cheesy graphics ( much like the movie 300), and so much slow motion that i seriously wanted to bang my head against a wall. The story though, was good enough i decided to go for a second episode to see if it got any better, and boy did it! The actors are some of the best I've seen in awhile. The show delves deep into the human soul, bringing about all forms of manipulation, debauchery, love, heartache, loss, devotion, and hope. The story is amazing, and the characters so real like that i would almost believe them real. I highly recommend this show if you like a good action-based series.

You will be hooked and be like me......dying for the next one! Hurry up and write!

0061969656|4.0|In the sixth book of Bernard Cornwell's Saxon Tales, he makes it clear with the title that this is the most important book of the series, as it's the one where Alfred the Great finally passes from this world, leaving this torn country with an uncertain future, and it will be up to his successor to decide what to do.    King Alfred dreamed of a united England, but now as he lies on his death bed, time is running out and this reality seems like it won't be happening anytime soon.  The Danes to the north are still not giving up, controlling a considerable proportion of the country and hungry for more.  It comes down to who has the more soldiers and the stronger alliances.  Also, even though Alfred's son Edward is the heir apparent, there are some other Saxons who have aims of taking the throne.  The Saxon-born, Viking-raised Uhtred who still believes strongly in the Norse gods will be the leader to once again make things happen; he has already sacrificed much for Alfred, and now finally receives a just reward, but he will have to fight to keep it from the attacking Danes, as well as swear fealty to the new king, Edward.    Fans will quickly gobble up Death of Kings, as they pay witness to the passing of an important character that was inevitably going to happen, but the good news is that Cornwell makes it clear in his afterword that while Alfred's part in this story may now be over, there is still more to tell, and Uhtred still has an important part to play.

0451450523|5.0|Every once in a while a book will come along and get written and be released to the world and become something so special and unique that it will stand the tests of time, whether it was published last year, or fifty years ago, or a hundred years ago.  In the magical fairytale style of The Princess Bride, The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle is certainly one of those ethereal books that generation after generation will read and enjoy for years to come.    \\"The unicorn lived in a lilac wood, and she lived all alone. She was very old, though she did not know it, and she was no longer the careless color of sea foam but rather the color of snow falling on a moonlit night.\\"  What she doesn't know, but eventually discovers is that she is the last unicorn on earth.  These magical beasts once roamed free and helped and healed those around them, but now she is the only one left.  And even though she is old, she is not very wise and soon finds herself a member of Mummy Fortuna's Midnight Carnival with no chance of escape.  But then a most unique individual comes along, named Schmendrick the Magician, whose magical powers work most infrequently, and only when he really needs them to; and he frees the last unicorn.  Molly Grue also joins the unusual travelers, who still has faith in fables and believes in legends, even though she has met a suspicious Robin Hood character and his band of overly-merry men.  They journey far and wide across the lands, have many adventures in search of the other unicorns, and end up at the withered castle of King Haggard, where the Red Bull lies in wait for the last unicorn.    Many complimentary words can be said about this book, but still they will not do it complete justice, as it just transcends so many levels and ages, making us all, perhaps just for a moment, believe in these wondrous beasts.  For the new anniversary edition, a quote on the front of the book from Patrick Rothfuss, author of The Name of the Wind, says it best: \\"The Last Unicornis the best book I have ever read.  You need to read it.  If you've already read it, you need to read it again.\\"    Originally written on February 13, 2012 ©Alex C. Telander.

1400079276|5.0|Internationally bestselling author Haruki Murakami is well known for his use of the fantastic in his novels, to the point where they could quite easily be classed as fantasy or science fiction books; at the very least the literary world likes to brand them as works of \\"magical realism.\\"  Kafka on the Shore is an excellent example of this and a good book to start on for those not too familiar with his work, as the world is well grounded before the fantastic appears in the story, broken up into shortish chapters so the reader doesn't become lost.  The book also features one of the darkest and most horrific scenes involving cats that I've ever read.    There are two storylines in Kafka on the Shore.  One is of Kafka Tamura, who is sick of the pathetic excuse for parenting from his celebrity father, and runs away from home, embarking on his own adventure, meeting special and unusual people only Murakami could create.  He is in search of the identity of his lost sister, and looking to find out who his real mother is.  Kafka ends up working at a small library, where there is a middle-aged lady who could well be his mother, as well as a transsexual librarian who becomes a good and close friend.    And then there is Nakata, an old simple man who seems to be losing his marbles, but actually knows what he's talking about and has his own journey to go on and complete.  He can also talk to cats.  After dealing with a problem he heads on his journey that skillfully brings him into the Kafka storyline, but it is not until near the end of the book that the whole story is revealed and realized.  While the story continues on a little too long, even though the story feels complete, Kafka on the Shore is a great example of the fantastic writer that is Haruki Murakami.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Before I bought all 3 books, I was hesitant at first due to some of the reviews.  I don't know anything about BDSM so I wasn't sure about reading them.  SOme of the other reviews stated they were unnerving and disturbing.  Others said it was disappointing and they couldn't finish the first book due to using the same words or phrases over and over again.<br /><br />I went ahead and bought and read all 3 books within a weeks time.  Yes, I will agree that the author does overly use a lot of words and phrases, however, the premise of the entire story (if you don't know what true BDSM is), was amazing!  It's a great story about love and personal struggles with excitement, drama and of course some nice love scenes.  I've recommended this series to several people who have loved them so far!
1451627289|5.0|In Stephen King's latest tome, weighing in at almost 850 pages, the master of horror takes on a whole new sub-genre that he hasn't really dealt with before: time travel. What's interesting is while playing around with time travel can be a lot of fun for a while, King sticks to simple rules, and has more fun in making 11/22/63 more of an excellent work of historical fiction.  The date -- November 11th, 1963 -- is one burned in many people's minds, especially if they were alive and old enough at the time to remember where they were the day President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas.    Jake Epping is a thirty-five year old high school teacher living in Lisbon Falls, Maine.  He enjoys his simple life, conveying to kids not just the beauty of the English language, but discussing and enlightening the teenagers with some of the great works of literature.  In the opening of 11/22/63, the reader learns about Harry Dunning's past life.  Dunning is an adult student who got his high school diploma a while ago; Jake still has that very special essay Dunning wrote.  It wasn't grammatically correct, and was filled with spelling errors; but it was also the story of the day Dunning's father came home drunk, when he was a child, and brutally murdered his mother, sister and brother with a hammer, while Dunning barely made it out alive with his life, suffering a smashed leg.    It was a moving story that Jake has never forgotten.  He enjoys his days after school going to see his friend Al, who owns a local diner, where he enjoys one of the most delicious burgers on the planet, and the amazing thing about it is he hasn't raised his prices in decades.  A customer can still enjoy a burger with fries for the ridiculously cheap price of under $3.  It seems like something Jake should be suspicious about, but the burgers taste too damn good.  The following day Jake meets up with Al again and finds him to be a changed man, incredibly aged overnight and he looks like he's dying; that's when Al tells him his story.    In the back of his diner is a portal to 1958.  Al himself has been back a number of times, and each time he comes back through it to the present, everything resets.  He's narrowed everything down to one important event he believes will change everything: the assassination of JFK.  He tried once, spending five years back then, but it didn't work.  Now it's up to Jake.  And just to prove that anything is possible, Jake's first mission is going to be to go back and stop Dunning's father from killing his family.    11/22/63 isn't a time travel science fiction novel, it's a historical fiction novel that features time travel; kind of like how The Time Traveler's Wife was a love story involving time travel.  And while the time travel is an entertaining facet of this novel, it is the moving story of the past, of the 1950s and early `60s, the lives of some incredible characters, and the work of one man's detailed effort to prevent one of the most infamous moments in American history.  King has outdone himself with some immense research, immersing the reader in the feel of this time period, in the minutiae of everyday life for some people living in Texas.  And as the reader reads further into the book, he or she can't not notice the details of this world, and how different it is to our modern one.  The result is a moving story with powerful characters and an insight into a way of life many of us have never experienced, making it one of King's most important works of his career.

0470601787|1.0|This book is all about how the author handled different situations. If you are looking for his auto-biography than this is it. The content is redundant, chaotic,very poorly organized and limited in its usefullness. Take advantage of amazon's offer to review the text, that will clue you in somewhat. If amazon had a lower rating than 1 I would give it. This is the most misrepresented, disappointing book I have ever purchased.
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|. . . cause it's not, It's a sequal. It's pretty bitchin'! When I watched it again after seeing it in the theater, I liked it much better. The songs are catchy and the plot is. . . ok. I would have liked it better if there was more emphasis on environmental concern, like in the first one but this was cute. I especially LOOOOOOOOOOVE Erik's opera: E.G. Daly is an awesomeness incarnate voice actor.

B004LROUW2|4.0|Bestselling Japanese author Haruki Murakami returns with his next encapsulating novel, and this one's a long one.  Originally released as three separate serialized books in Japan, 1Q84 has been released as a 944-page behemoth in the US.  It is the year 1984 and the main character, Aomame makes the decision and exits a taxicab on a gridlocked freeway and goes down an emergency escape staircase and finds herself transported to an alternate world of sorts, though it is still very similar to our own; she comes to call it 1Q84, where \\"Q\\" is Japanese for ?.    Aomame is a special kind of person; technically an assassin who has developed a way of stabbing a person at a specific point in the back of the neck with a small ice-pick type implement that immediately kills the person and makes it almost impossible to rule as anything other than a heart attack.  Aomame's targets are vicious, cruel man who have been bad to their spouses or children or other people for a long time and don't deserve to live in this world.    Then there is the other main character, a writer named Tengo, who is rewriting a most unusual novella penned by a seventeen year-old girl with the goal of having it win a literary prize and become a bestseller.  It is a most unique tale about these \\"little people\\" who create an air chrysalis, which is the title of the book.  Only, once the book becomes hugely successful, Tengo learns more about the origin of the story from the author, as well as the fact that these little people may very well be real in this 1Q84.    Aomame doesn't notice much different with the world of 1Q84, except that the police wear different uniforms and carry automatic machines guns, and also come nightfall there are two moons that rise up: one that looks just like ours, and another smaller misshapen one that rises shortly after it.  This is also a world where the little people exist too, though only Tengo knows about that.  And yet, under Murakami's skillful hand, the two are destined tomeet and be together, after their previous involvement when they were children; it will take time, but the question remains whether it will be soon enough before the little people carry out their own special plan.    1Q84 has many of the elements that Murakami fans have come to expect from him, with his unique characters that draw you in, a crazy world that makes you feel like you're playing a Japanese horror game in some ways, and a writing style that will sweep you along.  A weak point with the book is that while it was originally three books, it could've used some editing, which is always a risk with long works that span multiple volumes, and it slows the pace, detracting from the story.  Nevertheless, 1Q84 is a darkly enchanting novel that will suck you in and not let you go until you are satiated at the end, where a number of questions are answered, though of course, not all, for something must be left to the imagination, otherwise it wouldn't be a true Murakami novel.

B0049P1VHS|4.0|First, I've never read the comics (can't get into b/w graphic novels). Second, the only downfall for me is how short this series is.<br />Now that all that is out of the way, I'll get to why I enjoyed this (possibly too much?).<br />When that whole zombie craze came out a few years back (I was a short while from graduating high school in '06 then), I was very interested in *most* of the zombie-killing flicks (there were a couple that seemed lackluster), and when I saw the trailer for this show, it got me hooked. When I watched it, it completely caught me off-guard for one reason.<br />There wasn't so much gun craze as there was emotion in every episode. It seemed to come in somewhat equaled doses of humanistic emotions and creative kills with a pretty decent storyline with the added perk of a desolated area (zombie-filled dystopia, anyone?) that feels both isolated and give reason to be paranoid before every turn.<br />There's also a nice diversity of characters (though a couple of them don't like \\"diversity\\" if you know what I mean) with intertwining backgrounds that add to the suspenses and shock throughout this show.<br />Creativity, diversity, humanity, all adding to total insanity I very well enjoyed. Can't for season 2.
B0053JJLLC|3.0|Found as an incomplete manuscript on the late Michael Crichton's computer, Micro is an example of the old style of Crichton's work, with a great extension of cutting edge science, pushing it into the field of science fiction.  In some of Crichton's more recent novels there has been an overbearing philosophy and biased political angle; fortunately, there is little of this in Micro, though his \\"corrupt\\" characters are thin and painfully obvious.  Richard Preston, author of The Hot Zone and The Demon in the Freezer, was brought in by the publisher to complete the manuscript, and he does a good job of making the whole novel feel seamless, working off of Crichton's outlines, notes and research.    Micro opens with the scene of three unknown bodies found in a business office in Honolulu; cause of death is uncertain at first, and then attributed to a number of micro cuts and lacerations over the whole body, including, when it is investigated, inside the body on tissues and organs.  Cut to Nanigen Technologies, an up and coming company with a number of secret projects going on.  Seven graduate students are picked from MIT to become assistants for the company located in Hawaii, but stumble onto some details they shouldn't know anything about.  Before they know it, they find themselves shrunk down to just inches in size and abandoned in a rain forest arboretum, left to die.  The question is whether they can first keep themselves alive at this size, with everything out to get them, and then get themselves back to normal size and stop the people behind all this.    Micro definitely has its high points, and while the characters can seem predictable and shallow, overall it's an entertaining novel that doesn't hold up to any of Crichton's greats, like Jurassic Park and Congo, but is nevertheless a fun last book from this bestselling author.

B005TMSN4E|2.0|This product works as promised, more or less, but is fundamentally problematic with shorter focal length lenses. The crop factor of the CX sensor on the 1 series makes using F-mount lenses great for telephoto or macro work, but at wide angle focal lengths with large apertures, I've realized that using F-mount lenses with a 1 series camera doesn't really make much sense.<br /><br />I bought this adapter because I wanted to use fast F-mount primes to get some nice bokeh effects, which are not really possible with the 1NIKKOR lenses currently available (as of April 2012). However, having tried it with the Nikon F-mount 50mm and 35mm 1.8g lenses, I was disappointed with the results. With the aperture wide open, images are fairly blurry and there appears to be severe chromatic aberration (to the extent that the built-in CA algorithms in Lightroom 4 can't even clean it up). Additionally, focusing is very slow, often inaccurate, and only works in single-point single-servo mode.<br /><br />But worst of all, even with a 35mm, the crop factor multiplier means you're working well into the telephoto range, so you have to stand WAY back from your subject. For the kinds of picture taking I wanted to do (portraits and up-close shots of things like food, drink, and plant life, with lots of background blur), this is at best awkward and frequently impossible. (I find myself bumping my back against walls!) Sure, it may be possible to get in closer with a 24mm or 28mm lens, but suddenly we're talking about *really* expensive lenses at that point ($800-2000), which also would add a lot of heft to a camera whose very raison d'être is to be portable.<br /><br />This *adapter* alone is roughly half the price of Nikon's entry-level DSLR. You'd get much better results with that and a 35mm 1.8g lens for the type of photography I describe above. Save the V1 for popping into your backpack or purse for shots of opportunity while out and about. However, until Nikon comes out with some fast primes native to the 1NIKKOR system (they have been promised, but no release dates yet), for bokeh-filled shots in the wide-angle or normal ranges I'm afraid a DSLR is your only option at the moment.s native to the 1NIKKOR system (they have been promised, but no release dates yet), for bokeh-filled shots in the wide-angle or normal ranges I'm afraid a DSLR is your only option at the moment.
0345803485|1.0|I have never written a 1 star review, but I just had to chime in on this when I heard that they are talking about making a movie about it.<br />I am NOT a book snob and have no problem reading \\"easy\\" books for pure enjoyment, but this was just too poorly written. I am so surprised that book clubs are reading it and raving about it. Really?<br />I could not believe that Grey would not be bored to death with that much naivety. Perhaps a quick fling for the shock value he would get from her, but she bored me to death and I wasn't stuck with her for days on end.<br />Others have said everything that I have thought about it, so I won't waste your time repeating it.<br />My vote is no. Don't waste your money.
B001E45XT4|5.0|AMAZING headphones for the price. Good sound quality, great mic reception, nice easy intergrated volume wheel, and they are very durable. I knock them around quite a bit and the only thing that finally killed them was me swinging them by the cord at a rabid fox that entered my yard going after my dog. (Don't worry no animals were harmed; I missed and they hit a concrete wall). Going to buy 2 more pairs, a replacement.... and a backup in case I have any more Steve Irwin encounters.<br /><br />(GREAT at scaring off wild animals btw)

0307957934|4.0|I have enjoyed Robert Harris's writing since Fatherland more than a few years ago.  And there has not been one book of his I have been disappointed in.  HE chooses subjects that interest me, and this book is no different.<br /><br />Being familiar with Long Term Capital Management and how this company ruled the financial world until the unexpected collapse in the late 90's, this book touches on some familiar themes.  Brilliant physical scientist using his talents to design a computer program that will take advantage of modern trading technology.  Hubris in never expecting anything could go wrong (i.e. The Black Swan event).  Making money from betting and never from actual hard work.<br /><br />From the first few pages, Harris writes a book which enthralled me, when the scientist that is the protagonist of the story is robbed, apparently.  The book weaves a interesting (and fairly realistic scenario) into a book that captures the worst of human emotions (at least of one the Deadly Sins: Greed).<br /><br />The book is a thriller, and like his other books, Harris writes with a cinematic flair.  He is an excellent story teller.  I don't believe this is his best effort, but it is still a very entertaining read and worthwhile read.  Like most writers in this genre, if you read a thriller and learn something along the way, all the better. The book certainly captured my interest from beginning to the explosive end.
B006YG9HJE|5.0|Would highly recommend 'Nikita' to anyone looking for a fast-paced, intelligent, action-packed TV show that is enhanced by a stellar cast. I've been watching 'Nikita' since it originally aired & have totally enjoyed it. This is definitely one of the most underrated programs currently on TV.<br /><br />The 2nd season has shown a lot of maturity from the 1st & has consistantly been interesting, well written, & well acted, especially by Maggie Q, who is the best part of the entire series. 'Nikita' goes beyond the typical gov't assassin/James Bond plots & story lines, & goes for a well developed story that has viewers interested in the characters, how each episode will turn out, & keeps you guessing until the end. 'Nikita' doesn't rely on cheap, gratuitous violence, nudity, or any raunchy visuals to keep viewers watching. Instead it works at being an intelligent, well crafted program that offers people what they truly want to see.<br /><br />'Nikita' is one of those rare gems you find on TV, but its network doesn't support it & the show's plagued by low viewership. CW really needs to get its act together & understand that it has a great program on its hands. There's tons of potential with this show as far as where the story can go, character development, & so forth. High praise for 'Nikita'. Hope to see a 3rd season.

This book is no different than the others, only this time we get some cocky dude who sold a movie called \\"Blank Check\\" telling us why we have to write \\"EVERY\\" movie using the same methods and \\"GASP\\" they're all \\"HIS\\" methods.  Yawn.<br /><br />Truth is this -- All of these books, and I mean all of them, are telling you ways to write for Hollywood.  To sell that multi-million dollar picture.  That's all well and good, but as each one of these books clearly lay out, usually in condescending ways, you'll never be able to do such a thing.  It's too hard to break in and accomplish anything substantial in this industry.  So, again, why are we buying these books?  Why are we throwing all of our hearts and souls into this material?  We've all been told we'll never make it, but if you buy \\"said\\" book by \\"said\\" author, usually a failed screenwriter, you'll have a better shot of not making it than the guy who didn't buy my book.<br /><br />It's stupid.  It's silly and it's a waste of money.<br /><br />Structure is all well and good, if they taught you \\"real\\" structure.  They don't for the same reasons Magicians don't teach you their magic tricks.  For the same reasons musicians like Edge, Eric Clapton and Dave Genn don't personally sit down and give you guitar lessons.  You'll get the one screenwriter who says something like \\"I'm ready to pass the torch off\\" and he'll then try and relate to you over a chapter or two, but it's right back to the same ol' shenanigans...<br /><br />I'm going to echo what all of these books do.<br /><br />\\"YOU WILL NEVER SELL A SCREENPLAY TO HOLLYWOOD\\"<br /><br />Ever... You have a better chance of winning the power-ball than you do at selling a million dollar script to Hollywood.  You can, however, if you know format, can write/weave a good tale, relate sound dialogue and character on paper sell to an independent company and have your movie made.  That can happen.  Payout isn't much, but if you do enough of it you can have a nice supplemental income.<br /><br />What you must understand is this.  Blake Snyder was born into this industry... 95% of these guys are.  He's not cut from a different cloth than the rest of the industry.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Do NOT believe the hype people of literary taste! I am horrified that I read this tripe, I just kept hoping it would get better. I ordered the Trilogy on a friend on mine's breathless advice, saying that I would not be able to put this book down. She was right I kept on reading, incredulous that the author had duped this many people into thinking this was some sort of masterpiece. If you read the first 2 chapters you've read it all just re-read about 100 times and you've gotten the rest of the book.So many  REPETITIVE lines the author should be made to listen to someone read it to her 50 times. Terrible, terrible writing. Oh, and please do not think its because of the so called \\"erotica\\"  I happen to like good erotica, this is not any where close to good. Give me a break, who says \\"his hand brushed my sex\\"!!  Pass on this folks!
B004EPYZV2|4.0|Yeah, the movie is great.....what ticked me off is Paramount's false advertising on the front and back of the blu-ray packaging in regards to the digital copy working with iTunes.  It clearly says \\"Digital Copy\\" with the words \\"Works with iTunes\\" below it.  So, for those of us who like having the better picture quality of an actual blu-ray disc, but also want a digital copy, we've been used to throwing in a disc and transferring the copy to iTunes.  Well, this new UltraViolet crap from Paramount is exactly that...crap.  By \\"Works with iTunes\\", they really mean it 'works with our app, and our app only, which is available on the iTunes App store'.  There is no way to transfer a digital copy into your iTunes library...unless you rip the DVD.  So...if you want a digital copy, just buy it through iTunes or Amazon.  I won't bother buying another Paramount blu-ray again...I'd rather give Apple my money than get lured in by straight up lies on the packaging.<br /><br />Edit:  It appears Paramount has changed their website, making the digital copy actually available through iTunes or your player of choice...so, up to 4-stars.

Cruelty and brainwashing were norm inside the camps, to the point where even familial relationships were destroyed. In school, they went through daily sessions of \\"self-criticism\\" where they were made to write down everything bad and wrong they'd done against the regime.<br /><br />Dong-hyuki was taught to snitch on everyone, including his family, to escape punishment and to enjoy small \\"rewards\\". The young man, who saw his mother as competition for food, eventually<br />snitched to a guard on his own mother and brother after he learned they were trying to escape the camp. The guard betrayed Shin, and he was subjected to torture. The activist's snitching led to his mother's and brother's assassinations. At first, he felt nothing but anger toward his mother and brother, but later, would endure nightmares and guilt as an adult because of his role in their deaths.<br /><br />Shin through happenstance, learns about life outside of the camp, from cellmates. It's dreams of food and life outside the camp that leads him to risk escaping with a friend named Park. Park is eventually electrocuted against a fence while escaping; Shin escapes.<br /><br />Shin's story is a haunting portrayal of the misery inside North Korea's labor camps.
B000025H0Q|4.0|For fans of Nick Drake, this CD belongs in your collection. In my opinion, it's not his best work (I prefer the more stripped-down tracks that are found on \\"Pink Moon\\") but it's a great and mellow acoustic album nonetheless.
0307269752|5.0|This is an excellent book.  Even though it has many pages, it is so interesting that I could not put it down.  What a great mystery.  Excellent writing style - the author was so gifted.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The first book in the series \\"Hunger Games\\" is excellent. Easy to follow with very few, if any, subplots. Unfortunately, it's also the best book of the series, so enjoy this one as long as you can.
B000026FOA|4.0|For folks looking to discover Nick Drake, I would suggest checking out his album \\"Pick Moon\\" first because there's the most amount of Nick on that record. What do I mean by that? Well, Pink Moon features only Nick Drake; playing all guitars, singing all of the vocals, and playing a little bit of piano, that album doesn't have the orchestration (and while I feel rather neutral about all of that) that seems to hold Nick down a bit. I'm not saying this is a bad album at all, I think it's a solid release. What I'm saying is that I personally prefer Pink Moon the best. Fans of Nick Drake shouldn't miss out on this album because it does contain some really good tracks.
B0018QQQK8|3.0|The story is good, but it's not fantastically interesting or exciting.  It's actually quite predictable.  I was not impressed with the climax, which you could surely see coming... nor the end.  And, I'm not a fan of narratives in which you get long-winded background stories,... I just want action with little background in which I'm told only what is necessary for the story.  Otherwise, it's just boring.  Like a conversation about a subject you don't care about... Stuff you can skip over and still understand the story.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I've been playing this game on my droidx for quite some time. if you change the time on your device to two hours ahead or behind your energy refills. I like it to kill time. don't have to play it every single day. I guess having a life helps with the &quot;annoying&quot; refresh timeframe.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|great game!  i am a newbie and it seems to be fun flinging these birds that are angry! ads not bad<br /><br />,
B005723JSQ|4.0|I enjoyed the book, minus the \\"F\\" word being used a million times.  The story line and character build up was good.  I really enjoyed Poppy and Sam's characters.  The story was HILARIOUS - I had a quite a few good laughs while reading it.  It's a feel-good story.<br /><br />...A good read, minus the unnecessary foul language?  Do people in Britain say the \\"F\\" and \\"Jesus\\" all the time?  Even corporate ppl in their offices?  The foul language is why I have to give this book 4 stars instead of five.
B007WZ7ILK|5.0|The Beach Boys are back ladies and gentlemen. Not just Mike Love and Bruce Johnston, or Brian Wilson and his band. But, Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, Bruce Johnston, and David Marks. The surviving Beach Boys.<br /><br />I listened to their new single, \\"That's Why God Made the Radio\\" yesterday, and I absolutely love it. Not only is it filled with their classic harmonies and music melodies, but it is ten times better than their last number one hit, \\"Kokomo\\".<br /><br />Brian Wilson sings lead on this track, and my goodness is it awesome to hear him harmonizing with the rest of the boys again. I cannot wait to see what the future holds for the group and hope that this will lead to further tours and albums.<br /><br />Never in a million years would I have thought that the Beach Boys (all of them) would get back together and tour. Since the death of Carl Wilson and the numerous lawsuits, I thought it would never happen. But, here they are on their fiftieth anniversary sounded as good as ever and better than anything else on the radio.<br /><br />This song is quickly becoming my favorite Beach Boys song. I just can't stop listening to it.
1401937519|5.0|I love this book and I highly recommend that everyone read it!  Anita's story is impactful and life changing. I gave spoken to several other people who have read Dying to Be Me and they felt the same way.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I read the first book and thought it was great.  Sad but great.  Then got to the second and was beginning to see the downward spiral of death and destruction.  By the third I could barley finish.  I was flabbergasted by all the horrific scenes.  I felt so depressed every time I closed the book. The ending was also quite boring.<br />I would recommend the first but not the last unless you like to read about children and women dying.  Sorry for the spoilers but I think a person should know what they are about to get into in a book.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|its a pretty good game really takes a little bit to get used though. but for free its great ha he
B007V2UGPE|3.0|The game is decent as a distraction but not as a full game. Controls are easy and the art is not as bad as it could be. Sound is meh but there's enough going on that you don't really notice it. The ads and the GLUspam is horrid. I don't want to be a part of a game's community just for a &quot;few&quot; g credits or whatever. The biggest hitch is the performance hit. I am playing on a Nexus S and it plays more like a slide show than a game, thankfully it isn't all the time. I think the performance issue is really the ONLY real problem though.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Love this! Cline made me want to embrace my geek past, with head held high.<br />This book was a fantastic ride. I am a bit worried about how WB plans to make a movie out of this, though. How they'll be able to secure all the rights to all those games, music and movie references will be interesting to watch.
B000M5AJQI|5.0|Product arrived 26 April. This was 6 days ahead of time. Great Service, not the cheapest place to buy movies, but the fastest.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Little annoying having to hit options to exit but otherwise I enjoy it. Like that you can buy or earn acorns.
B0000214F1|1.0|In the hype for this movie they claim it is the most controversial film ever made.  The only controversy I can imagine is whether or not this is the worst movie ever made.  I could only watch about 20 minutes of it.  I have only myself to blame for purchasing it, but my defense mechanisms want to blame another entity for this scam.  Amazon...shame on you.  You should pay us to take this trash out of your inventory!  Ah, just thought of another controversy.  How in hell did Guiccione (or however he spells his name) manage to get marquee names like McDowell, Mirren, Gielgud etc.  associated with this travesty?
B005K17RU0|5.0|great app.  I recommend this for up to date information.  We live in the country and I use it every day. Get the app.
0131103628|5.0|Over a decade ago, I dropped an introductory programming class in C because I couldn't understand this book. I was an absolute beginner, and this book was impenetrable. Now, with the benefit of subsequent experience, this text is clear as day.<br /><br />The K&R is a programming classic, and with good reason. It's a succinct guide, only 274 pages, which clearly illuminates the language without excess verbiage or other distractions which have turned many modern programming texts into 1000 page tomes.<br /><br />Although the C language is clearly described and explained, you'll find precious little hand holding here since this book is written primarily for the programmer who is new to C, and not for the absolute beginning programmer. In fact, you won't even find answers to the exercises in this book. For that you'll need \\"The C Answer Book\\" by Tondo & Gimpel, which not only gives the answers, but, more importantly, explains them.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0131096532 The C Answer Book: Solutions to the Exercises in 'The C Programming Language,' Second Edition]]<br /><br />Nevertheless, for the experienced programmer, or the highly motivated beginner, this book delivers, and its diligent study is well rewarded. Be aware, however, that maximum benefit from this book can only be derived by completing all the exercises which are an integral part of the text's tutorial approach.<br /><br />Once you've studied the text, completed all the exercises, and understood the answers, you'll be well on your way to the mastery of C. I therefore give this book my highest possible recommendation.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|The title explains all. I got this game because I was glad to have a bigger screen to play on. However, I cannot get into the app on my kindle fire to play it. PLEASE FIX THIS!
B000MV9026|5.0|We were happy to find this movie at Amazon at a really decent price! We had just bought Happy Feet 2, and wanted to have both movies for the kids. This is definitely a great movie, with lots of humor and good clean fun; however, adults can find a lot of hidden humor in it, too. The music and \\"dancing\\" are wonderful! Amazon also did their usual great job with price, and it arrived quickly and in excellent condition.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have tried to use other Bible apps before and this one is, by far, the easiest to navigate. I also love the ability to change to different versions, and bookmark certain verses.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good way to pass the time. been easy so far. looking forward to opening new games,  points are easy to rack up
B007N85POS|3.0|That's not proportional for a mobile game...<br />I don't see any reason to pay so much for a mobile game, even if it's the mighty Angry Birds Rio...
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|It's somewhat difficult to follow the story line but intriguing.  It is a must-read after having read the two previous books.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|pretty awesome. keeps me entertained for hours. great for long trips or on a plane! I would recommend it to you!
B003ICWTR4|5.0|what a great concert a must have if you love bruce<br />clearity and sound the best ever....buy it you wont be dissappointed
098357670X|5.0|I think its a must for anyone interested in making caricatures. It covers the basics from what to look for in your subject, how to draw the different features and organize them,and much more.
B000PWQPAC|5.0|I really like the movie.  I found the plot interesting and I'm happy to see SOC continue in some form.  I hope they make more movies and another series.  I own the SOC and 2nd gig full series.  I watch them once a year, and they still are fun to watch.  You pick up on new things each time you watch them, if you pay attention.  Looking up the story online can yield insights too.<br /><br />Note: I would watch this in English first, if I were you.  I tried the Japanese first and subtle plot points were hard to follow.  I watch it with a friend, which helped.  We BOTH want to watch it again sometime soon.
1401937519|5.0|Litterary speaking, it is not a great book from first to last page, but that is not why I bought the book. I bought it for the story. And this story is a well written five star experience.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|She does it again. This is another great album From Kelly Clarkson. I got the special edition that has 17 songs on it and i love everyone of them which is very hard to find! I previewed the album on itunes before i bought it and I will say that it is awesome! If you like Kelly Clarkson you must get this album!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this is great!<br />I really love it because its just like the on your I pod or I phone. I say people should get it!
B0075PYG1M|5.0|This is a great album! The aura it gives off is a feeling that you can only get from music such as this!
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|As a rule, I do not like survival movies at all - 127 Hours sucked big time. Bugger all happened and it put me (and everyone else) to sleep. No offense to the guy who's life it is based on. Watching a guy trapped for several hours hallucinating is not my idea of a good film.<br /><br />This movie however is an exception to that rule. I went to the cinema to see something else and got my times wrong. It was wet outside so I couldn't be bothered catching my bus home. This was the only thing playing so I went in. I am so glad I did because it was totally worth it.<br /><br />Liam Neeson just keeps getting better over the years. Some older actors really loose the plot after a while but not this guy. He is brilliant in this movie. I have watched lots of his movies lately and he cant seem to do anything wrong. He is very believable as a grizzled take charge kind of guy, he has a very gripping presence that makes it hard to watch anyone else. He is very commanding on screen & clearly a great leader for this group of lost travellers that crash their plane in a remote wilderness only to be hunted down by a group of large ravenous wolves.<br /><br />Good characters and plenty of action. You will not be disappointed with this film
B007PTJOV0|5.0|can't stop playing this game!!!!! so much fun telling everyone about it once you start it you can't stop yourself
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I just finished watching this movie, and all I can say is Wow!  I've read other reviews that mentioned the deficits of this movie, but honestly, I could not find ANYTHING disappointing in this film.  PS. This is the best Hulk yet!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|entertaining and fun to play. the rewards are fun and challenging to obtain.  the visuals are crisp and clear.  easy and enjoyable to play.
006097625X|4.0|The power of comics is the expressions packets it can deliver in few picture. I started reading about visual communication by reading books from Dan Roam [[ASIN:1591844592 Blah Blah Blah: What To Do When Words Don't Work]]. And later I wanted to move to finer art of bringing more expressions into my drawing. And this book on understanding comics gives a such a cool rollerskating ride into the science ( its art, but the author does the heavy lifting of making it easily understood ) of drawing and cartoons that I couldn't let it go. Awesome read. Thank you for the effort Scott.  Highly recommended for beginners of comics artists as well as any one who wants to communicate with team visually.
0743437497|4.0|I decided to return to this book about 20 years after I read it at first, my review will be from that standpoint..<br />  I was shocked by some of the nuance I just didnt feel at the time. Perhaps my perceptions of the characters were colored by the movie by Kubrick, but I feel the characters are so much better fleshed out.  In particular Halloran and Wendy just seemed way more vibrant especially compared to the movie version.  This is a great effort by Mr. King to do his take on the classic \\"haunted mansion\\" setting.  It does not dissappoint in any of the phases of execution.  What I love is how Mr. king can use the Hotel to give you a taste of particular times, as it feels it all blends together at the Overlook.  He does a great job handling all the diverse elements to make a pleasing blend.  As a re-read, it holds up very well, as one of my old favorites I enjoyed the scenarios I recalled, but with some added feel to the characters some years of growing up added.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I see people giving 3 stars because they had to free up space on their kindle to download or because it doesn't  give notification when it is their turn- boo hoo! sounds like #firstworldproblems. this game works great and connects to show FB friends who play. Great fun! much easier to draw on a larger kindle screen than a phone.
0385737955|5.0|I loved reading every word and every page of The Maze Runner, I know a lot of bloggers say something like this but its so true for me about this book.  I listened and read this book at the same time and it had me sucked into the story so much that I got goosebumps reading parts of it.<br /><br />The Maze Runners plot is so solid and so detailed that it seems that its a movie being played out inside your head as you read.  I loved the characters in this story so much that I couldn't help but cheer them on or scream at them at some points as well.<br /><br />The main part of this book is about the boys stuck inside of a court yard I guess you would call it and all around them on the outside of these huge doors is a crazy maze that they have to try to figure out so they can try to get back to their life's.  The thing is they don't remember their life's!  Then one day a girl shows up and all of the sudden everything is turned upside down!<br /><br />This story is jam packed full of twists and turns and keeps you  right on the edge of your seat the whole time.  I couldn't stop reading/listening till I knew what was going to happen to my favorite characters.<br /><br />I will say my favorite characters (since I know I can't pick one) would have to be Chuck, Newt, and Minho.  I love how brave Newt and Minho are and I love how Chuck was like the little brother in The Maze Runner.  I really enjoyed the part where Chuck played tricks on the other boys.<br /><br />Also, in this story I loved how each boy had their own job and how organized the group was. Each group in the living area had their own tasks every day, even the runners and each group had their own names as well.  Like I said, this book is so detailed but in that perfect way that keeps you wanting more.<br /><br />If you haven't read this book its a must! I couldn't put it down and if a dystopian book is what you are looking for this is an amazing one!<br /><br />I can't wait to start the next book in this series and I already have it on audio, so I'll be listening to it as soon as I can!  Make sure you are on the look out for my review for The Scorch Trials very soon!!!d I already have it on audio, so I'll be listening to it as soon as I can!  Make sure you are on the look out for my review for The Scorch Trials very soon!!!

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is a terrific historical soap opera, focusing on the \\"upstairs\\" and \\"downstairs\\" of a noble family (the Crawleys) and their servants.  It is set in the decade before WWI, and, for the second season, the years of the war and the immediate aftermath.  The acting is for the most part excellent, and the cinematography is exceptional.  There are even some scenes from the fighting front.  The British can still make great television dramas, though they can't do much else any more!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so much fun I cant put it down. My friend recommended it to me and I recommend it to you. It's a lot of fun,  I. never thought one app could have so many games. :-)
B005UDD1R6|1.0|Lame, horrible volume control. Everything else is simply just average.  There wouldnt be much point in this application unless you liked downloading things that take up memory that are utterly worse than the original app.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the second book in the trilogy and the plot just keeps on coming.  I wondered why it was listed aa a book for young people and then realized that it was classified as such because it had no explicit sex scenes and no foul language.  You don't need these if you have a great plat and this one certainly does.  Couldn't put it down and reading it with other relatives and following it on Facebook with them.  If you read no other book this year, read this one AFTER first reading the Hunger Games (the first book).  Gotta read the third book now...
B001993Y2C|2.0|First off, for all you frakking Toaster lovers out there, do not buy either the \\"Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (with Collectible Cylon) on Blu-ray or DVD.  This is not a review of the TV show itself, which is a shining example of science-fiction at its best, nor is this a review of Amazon (they were perfect as always), but this is a review of the packaging in which Universal Studios atrociously decided to place this angel of a series.  The only reason I gave this product 2 stars instead of 1 is simply because the boxed set is visually quite cool; it would look excellent on display in the living room.  Unfortunately, appearance is the only thing going for the packaging.  The box is immediately difficult to open to access the individual seasons, and once it is fully open the individual seasons have to be removed at an awkward angle that requires a gentle hand in order to not tear the cardboard.  All the disks are housed not in the typical plastic cases that suspend the disks and prevent their delicate surfaces from being scratched, but they are tightly squeezed in CARDBOARD sleeves.  Removing the disks a few times will scratch them and eventually render them useless.  Also, the disks were out of order: 1, 4, 3...  That is inexcusable.  There is no episode guide, which is a pure lack of foresight on Universal, and to top it all off, The collectible cylon's right foot was broken off.  It seems as if they put all of their energy into designing an awesome looking box, then said, \\"whatever,\\" to everything else.  So, to reiterate, this is an awesome show, but DO NOT buy either the Blu-ray or DVD versions that come WITH the Collectible Cylon, the packaging from Universal Studios is horible.  INSTEAD, buy the newer Blu-ray or DVD versions that come in the smaller silver/grey boxes WITHOUT the cylon.  From what I have read of these, the packaging is much improved and simplified, and an episode guide is included.  One last note, Amazon is golden.  The package arrived so well packed I could not imagine a human baby being better protected.  I hope this clears things up about what to buy.<br /><br />P.S. I would like to add that since buying and returning this item, I have bought \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" on Blu-ray per each individual season. Each season was well packaged in traditional plastic holders that suspend the discs and I was able to watch each disc with plenty of time to check everything for errors (in case I had to return the set).  It was also much cheaper.  Each season I bought was only about $20.00, and since there are only four seasons I spent far less than I would have for the entire series in one boxed set.  So, bottom line, buy each season individually.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is so much fun. it reminds me of mario bros. I recommend it. its fun for all ages
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I've been watching for the Fire version for months! I don't know what took so long, but I'm happy it's here!
0671449028|5.0|Every review here is the same thing: \\"I read this book to my child every night\\".  There's a reason for that.  It's short, it's fun, the pictures are colorful and engaging, and reading it makes you feel better.<br /><br />It's not perfect: one of the words, \\"somebody\\", doesn't quite scan quite right rhythmically. I also scratch my head about why (SPOILER!) they exercise after they take a bath.<br /><br />Having said that, this book makes my life better, and makes my daughter happy.  Buy it right now.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Not particularly inspiring or clever, but easy to read escapist nonsense.  It's Twilight plus a little bondage and minus the fangs.  Is it great literature - absolutely not!  Is it a harmless way to while away a couple of hours - absolutely!<br /><br />The self-made multi-millionaire with the tortured past and the innocent young girl who saves him - yeah, total crap!  They'll probably make it into a movie.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|this ap in no way is good for anyone any age.  all you do is shoot birds from barriers. not a nice thing to instill in children. I would not give a penny for this time waster.

B000JBWWRY|5.0|i bought this movie for my soon to be 3 year old niece for her bday on april 28 and i got the item within 5 days of ordering. the quality of the movie is great. the only thing was that the disc was sliding around in the case but no harm was done. i am amazed with how short of time it took to recieve it. thank you so much for the movie. i couldnt find it anywhere else but here. i know she will have a huge smile on her face when she sees it. THANK YOU SO MUCH!

B004LWZW7E|5.0|Well this movie told a very old yet ALIVE tail of how our legal system really works to this date.  Just change out \\"TIME\\" for currency and this is as real as you can get it.<br /><br />I though it was a good plot it kept you busy till the end and didn't really slow down for the pause and bathroom break.  I think we could have had alittle better back story on this but I think it might have ruined the plot if they gave more away.  I good movie is a movie you can talk about for at least 2 days.

0091922348|5.0|I bought this book because I was cooking from Ottolenghi's Plenty, which I love for its creative combinations of vegetables, herbs, and spices.  This second book, based on dishes prepared at the authors' London restaurant, also named Ottolenghi, is equally superb.  I started with the broccoli salad because I adore broccoli and because the author noted that restaurant customers picketed when it was removed from the menu.  I love it!  Parboiled and charred broccoli dressed with garlic and pepper and the oil they're cooked in.  Just exquisite!<br /><br />I have owned and cooked from many notable cookbooks over the years, and this is the first, along with Plenty, that really enchants my primal tastebuds.  One can really taste what one is eating, and appreciate the different ingredients. The recipes are stunningly creative. I am just fascinated by this book!<br /><br />Some reviewers complain about the recipes being \\"fiddly\\" or full of difficult to locate ingredients. One reviewer said she found the recipes almost intimidating.  I think they're fun...and one can always punt.<br /><br />To those for whom photos make a cookbook--these are gorgeous and arty and sparkly, and some can make one drool.

B007MNV5WU|5.0|I now have all the ad-free angry birds apps and this one is just as fun as all of the others. Most enjoyable on the Kindle Fire (bigger screen) but playing them on the Motorola Photon 4G is awesome too.  Don't mute the volume unless you have to (i.e. at the library or other quiet place) because the noises that some of these birds make are just as entertaining as playing the game.  Downloading and installing from the Amazon App Store was easy.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|It was a good cost havent watched it yet  bet it will be good i like movies i bet i will buy more movies.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|This game was REALLY fun. I loved it, and you don't need direct Wi-Fi (at least I think you don't) for it. However, LOVED is past tense. It stopped working. I'd click on it to get to the game but it stopped and just took me right back to wherever I was before. For instance, if I was on home and it was in my carousal, I'd click on it... it'd say FOX tm, but then it went right back home (I have a Kindle Fire.). If this doesn't fix soon I am afraid I will have to uninstal it. *sigh* until then... I want it to recover.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is a nice light game that easy to play and understand. good way to wind down and kick back
B0018QQQK8|4.0|Good book! I didn't like how it ended...didn't give much detail about the climax of the story but overall pretty good
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I enjoy this game. The only real issue I have with it is that without spending real money it will take a lot longer to complete quests.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|I was going to edit this to tone down the snark factor, but it still felt right the next day, so I am keeping it.<br />Edited for additional info/warnings about the storyline.<br /><br />5 stars. This book was no less than amazing~<br />But first a PSA then the rave :)<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of Fifty as it reads like an homage to the best of that series except it is very well written.<br /><br />Note to those who hate erotica, are disgusted by the Fifty series, think Fifty was a psychopath because he was possessive, controlling or sexually dominant and/or those who could not embrace the lead characters in that series because they both had \\"issues\\" and you felt that sent a bad message or they just irritated you or you found yourself badmouthing them for one reason or another:<br />Please do not read this book!<br /><br />Because:<br />You will likely find all kinds of things to dislike about this book as well and will likely trash it in your reviews also. So again, I would like to encourage you not to read it in the first place (really tempted to add the word, \\"duh\\" here). Even if this book becomes sooooo popular that you feel \\"compelled\\" to read it because of the \\"hype\\". Even then. Don't do it. Trust me.<br />I know, I know...<br />it's burning its way up the Amazon charts as we speak.<br />But stay calm. Control yourself.<br />Don't let your twitchy finger hit that one-click just yet!<br /><br />You know, I'm trying to help you avoid that thing you did with Fifty when you read it and HATED it- exactly the way you knew you were going to when you read the other reviews that described, in detail, all the kinds of things you would hate about it ahead of time... before you read it... in advance. You know(?), right before you proceeded to read the book anyway then wrote a four hundred word diatribe regarding all the things you disliked about it.<br /><br />So let me be clear: My warning is for the readers who made the decision to read the Fifty series based on 5-star reviews and popularity who moved out of their genre, taste or reading level to do that.<br />Then trashed it.<br /><br />Trashing a book because it is out of your taste range and deals with subject matter you would normally find toxic or unappealing seems like redonk behavior to me.<br /><br />  ********************************************************<br /><br />Okay, that said, let's move on the raving portion of our program :)<br /><br />As I mentioned, Bared to You is an amazing read. It's emotionally gripping and very sensual.<br />It is clearly a nod to Fifty and distills that series (which was hugely flawed as it was written by an amateur, neophyte author) and re-works it into a polished, well-paced, engaging story with a similar, but unique storyline.<br /><br />The writing here is excellent.<br />Not because it's poetic or lush, but because it is clean and efficient and didn't get in my way, ever. The story and characters are the stars of the show.<br />They are riveting.<br /><br />The narrative is about two very flawed, emotionally scarred people, both victims of childhood sexual abuse, and explores their process of working out the emotional and relational \\"issues\\" that arise as they participate in this highly-intense, sexual relationship with one another. The characters feel co-dependent at times and things often feel dysfunctional. It's totally appropriate to the material, but things are rather dramatic and charged as this couple work toward their very tentative and at-risk HEA (or rather, their HFN as we await the sequel). Both characters are so well-drawn I was rooting for both of them from jump street.<br /><br />If you need your characters to be good boys and girls, to remain emotionally stable throughout the narrative and to never pose a risk to the other at any time or ever engage in unstable behavior, stay away.<br /><br />*spoiler-ish comments below, but only mildly so and may be important for you to know in advance*<br /><br />If abit of stalker-ish behavior, obsessive behavior, grabbing, shaking or carrying off another person or one giving the other a mighty slap once is gonna make you bonkers, leave it on the shelf.<br /><br />That said, the characters do not tie each other up (he may tell her to hold onto something and not let go a few times, but he never binds her) and they do not physically punish one another (well, except the mighty slap). They also know that they need therapy/intervention to get through their turmoil as a couple and individually as survivors of abuse and they get that.<br /><br />*end spoilers*<br /><br />However, once again, if there is anything beyond a repetition of words and poorly constructed sentences and inner goddesses that you did not love about the Fifty series, then stay the hell away from this one.<br />Just sayin'.<br /><br />Can't wait for the next book!bit of stalker-ish behavior, obsessive behavior, grabbing, shaking or carrying off another person or one giving the other a mighty slap once is gonna make you bonkers, leave it on the shelf.<br /><br />That said, the characters do not tie each other up (he may tell her to hold onto something and not let go a few times, but he never binds her) and they do not physically punish one another (well, except the mighty slap).

B005ZUR724|5.0|This game blows my mind and gets me all wet. only problem is that fighting monsters doesn't do much for your Exp. Eventually quests will run out and you'll have to fight for hours but over all I love it!
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I really enjoy fun.'s ability to take depressing or terrible concepts and turn them into a beautifully written and performed work of art. The songs are extremely enjoyable to work and sing along to, and the songs stay in your head for hours.<br /><br />If you haven't checked out fun. yet I highly recommend it. If you like alternative rock,  you'll love fun.

B005USZYDU|5.0|I love this book! Grisham has gone over the top. Good read, don't want to put it down. It's actually a believable circumstance. Can't wait to read the next in the series!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|For me it flowed with the rest of the books. Its a book ment for preteens and teenagers so you cant expect a epic fight seen or a explicit sexual scene. That would make it a adult book so reviews that take credit from the book because there wasnt enough sex or gore is ridiculous. There is sex just not descriptive sex which makes it something I would let my neice read. I appreciate Meyer's consideration when writing this book. Making it more kid friendly. There REALLY is way to much sex in the media lately and I appreciate the consideration when writing for her intended audiance.It was a decent book. Worth the read
1439192812|5.0|Dawkins' latest book is aimed at a \\"younger\\" audience, but at 65 I found the book informative and enjoyable reading. Over the years I have forgotten many things, and science has made giant strides. The book was just plain fun!
B0053O89IS|5.0|The seventh season of \\"Bones\\" finds forensic anthropologist Dr. Temperance \\"Bones\\" Brennan and her FBI partner Seeley Booth adjusting to a significant change in their relationship: the pending birth of a child, conceived late last season in a moment of shared grief over the death of a colleague.  Bones remains stoically on the job at the Jeffersonian Institute and in the field despite her advancing pregnancy, while Booth will become increasingly frantic in his often misguided efforts to protect her.  Series fans will be treated to the full humor of a lively debate over where to live and how to raise their child.  The blessed event itself will have all the suspense that awkward timing in the middle of a tense case can give it.<br /><br />The changes will ripple through the Jeffersonian forensic lab.  Dr. Sweets gets increased field duty as a substitute partner for Booth, and cannot help psychoanalyzing everything.  Bones' best friend Angela will attempt to prepare her for working motherhood, while Dr. Saroyan will try to keep the lab functioning while minding an unending parade of interns.  The entire Jeffersonian team will be involved in a chilling season-ending cliff-hanger episode.<br /><br />\\"Bones\\" contines to feature a crime of the week, to be solved through a combination of exotic forensics work by the lab rats and Booth's old-fashioned police work.  However, the best part of the series is the fun interaction of the Jeffersonian staff and the \\"opposites attract\\" relationship of Bones and Booth.  The seventh season is highly recommended to its fans.
B003QS9SGA|4.0|So I'm sure this movie is great but one minute and 10 seconds into it the picture got all jumbled and all I could do is hear the audio. Disappointing because I paid to watch this and really want to see it. :(
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love solitaire and this is a good version with plenty of options. I admit to wishing it kept track of my high scores,  but for a free game you really can't complain. I spend quite a bit of time playing and trying to beat my completion time. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys solitaire.
B002SAUCBC|1.0|Longest book ever!!! Should have known by the title. After the first 100 pages I skipped to the end and still didn't miss anything.
0743497465|5.0|Dan Brown's thorough research style shows itself in this book, much as it has in his other books. He details out the science in such a way as to make the reader ask, \\"How'd he know that?\\" Great research, that's how. His fictional science sounds just as believable, too.<br /><br />What's more, the plots were believable, rich, and complex, and the multiple interlocking plots left me guessing all the way to the end. This book is definitely a \\"page turner.\\"<br /><br />The ending is rich and satisfying, not something thrown together because the author got tired of writing at the end, or had no ending at all.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />Thanks, Dan.
B0002BO05S|5.0|The first time I saw this film was when I was a young girl.  It moved me then, as well.  I've been wanting it for many years and I'm thrilled to have it now. Can't go wrong with Max Von Sydow, anyway.  Greatest Story Ever Told. Truly.

B004AYCWY4|4.0|This book has a lot of great information. Richard Dawkins is always extremely articulate and I learned a lot from reading this book. However, I wish he was more mindful of his audience. The average joe isn't likely to whip open a book like this for some fun reading, yet I feel like when I was reading it that that's who Richard Dawkins was targeting as an audience. Having a biology background sometimes I found myself wishing he would get to the point and quit reusing simple metaphors and examples that are commonly known. Yet if his purpose was to target the average person genuinely interested yet unlearned in this discipline of science, then he entirely achieved his goal. Great book, even though he sometimes gets caught up on religion as is typical with the man but otherwise an excellent read.
B005D0RDIE|5.0|This review is to help those people out that are having problems with the audio on the DVD. When you want to play the concert footage and if you don't have your DVD player hooked up via HDMI or other digital source you're gonna need to either hit your audio selection button on your remote control, or go to the set up menu and select the stereo option to be able to hear the concert audio. The DVD is automaticly set to play in DTS 5.1 which can not be heard if you're using RCA cables, or if you're using a DVD player that is built in to your TV. HTH
B005FPT51K|2.0|I bought this camera so when I had to travel for work I could peek in on my little man at night. However, the networking set up for viewing outside your home network for this application is a nightmare! It was pretty easy to get it to work on the home network, but that (in my opinion) is only getting half use out of this expensive monitor.  I had to contact iBaby for support and my network provider for help with port forwarding (which they charge you for tech support).  Finally I just gave up.  It shouldn't be this difficult!  On top of all that, the application crashes too often and is not reliable in any way as a singular monitor device for your child.  You can't know when it might just stop working in the middle of the night.<br /><br />So- I have returned this item.  The camera had a good picture, but the networking set up and application crashing is too horrible to make this a usable product.  Until these 2 items are better I will just settle for a standard video monitor that I can count on to work.<br /><br />Pro:<br />- good video picture<br /><br />Con:<br />- terrible application - crashes all the time<br />- difficult (impossible) network set up for viewing off the home network (i.e. when traveling)
B006NXIDMU|4.0|I found this book to be a very enjoying and captivating read. The first person writing style was different and refreshing. It broke down a wall between the main character and the reader, allowing the reader to delve inside the character's head creating a completely different experience to other works of fiction. It made the characters seem more real and allowed the reader to connect with all characters, as if one were actually witnessing the hunger games. I encourage everyone to read this book, and I am already diving into the sequel with high hopes and expectations.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it us fun and my kid love it to I love how it donest show bad stuff for the kids
B007ATHNJA|2.0|When Nerone's costume looks like something Joanne Worley might have worn on Laugh-In, you know you are in trouble. I suppose the idea was to make him resemble a bird of prey, but for me at least it just made him look silly. Philippe Jaroussky gives a fine performance, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't concentrate on his singing. I just kept waiting for him to lay an egg. For the most part, the sets and costumes are not just tasteless but cheap. Nero's guards look like a couple of leather queens who just returned from Folsom Fair.<br /><br />In fact the whole production seems to suggest that Nero's Rome was an enormous leather dungeon in which the various characters engage in sado-masochistic games with each other. That could in fact be a valid interpretation of this most morally subversive of all operas. Visconti, who understood the Italian Renaissance, might have been able to pull it off. But this production looks more like a road tour of the Addams Family. You have to close your eyes even to begin appreciating the opulence of the score and the wit of the libretto. This is one of the greatest operas ever written, but the first time viewer would be pardoned for not recognizing it as such.<br /><br />Apart from Jaroussky and Danielle De Niese, the singers are seldom more than adequate. The nurses, who steal the show in other DVDs of the opera, are dull here. As is Ottavia. As is Seneca. Christie's conducting is immaculate, but he cannot redeem the travesty that is taking place on stage. If you want to get a sense of what this opera is about in a fine modern production, I recommend the recent Glyndebourne DVD, in which De Niese also appears as Poppea. The old Peter Hall production with Maria Ewing also holds up well. But avoid this desecration like the plague.
0553386794|5.0|I am an avid reader of science fiction and fantasy (Tolkien, Heinlein, Herbert, Jordan, etc), yet continued to ignore Game of Thrones due to having other books on my bucket list.  When HBO released the series, I ignored that too - until my friends kept informing me of my mistake.<br /><br />I opted for the audiobook, thinking I'd listen to it on the way to and from work.  The narrator, British actor Roy Dotrice is amazing.  His voice adds quite a bit of personality to the characters.  I found myself multiple time sitting in my car, at my destination - glued to the story and unable to leave.<br /><br />Coming off of a re-read of Jordan's Wheel of Time series, Game of Thrones felt light and peppy.  Not in relation to the content and story, but in the manner in which Martin choose words and crafts sentences.  Where Jordan feels like a slow plod through the story, Martin is able to deftly add backstory in a way that reminded me of Tolkien.<br /><br />There is no question that I am dropping everything else, and picking up the second book.  I also started watching the HBO series - but found it a pale shadow compared to the novel.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This is my fab app, no doubt. It works perfectly on my Kindle Fire. I have been downloading videos constantly since I installed it. I am a quilter, and there are so many amazing tutorials on youtube. But on a crowded sewing table there isn't always room to set up a lap top, or at a class or guild meeting wifi isn't always available. But I am always able to view my videos thanks to Freedi. Great app, finally one that does something I need.  Love it! Really extends the functionality of a wifi-dependent device.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved reading this book it was great! This is one of those books that grabs you right from the start, and does let go until the end. I finished this book in a matter of hours and just had to get my hands on the other two.
0307716546|5.0|This is a book for all lovers of quality fiction, nuanced story telling and lyrical writing. Lupton takes the relationship between a mother and daughter and places it at the centre of a tightly written literary thriller.<br /><br />After Grace goes into a school fire to rescue her daughter Jenny what first appears a tragic accident of events is then revealed to be a sinister and deliberate act of what, revenge? Jealousy? Insanity? Grace has little time to find out who set the fire and why. She is trapped, as is Jenny, between this world and the next. Both in a critical and unconscious state. In this 'afterwards' they are able to connect and must play detective. Because only they are able to pass unnoticed through the hospital. Only they are able to put together what happened that day. Only they are able to see that someone is still trying to finish what they started.<br /><br />This story is as much the evolution of a mother/daughter relationship as it is a thriller and how two people come to truly understand and appreciate one another when it matters most.  Which is why it stays with you long after you read it.
0345529057|5.0|So I loved this series when it came out last year on HBO and then invested in this 4-book set. I couldn't have been happier! Cannot BELIEVE that they sold this set for around $20 bucks. I'm on the last book of the series and I haven't had any quality issues at all. Love it, love it, LOVE IT! Thanks for such a SWEET deal.<br /><br />Side-note: The HBO series follows the books to a T! which makes reading these books absolutely addictive. So glad I stumbled on this show so I can enjoy these fabulous books. Each book is at least 800 pages thick, but it isn't thick reading.... it moves so fast. Fantastic value for a fantastic series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is young adult gold! It is the first in an addicting trilogoy. Very ineteresting and entertaining for adults and adolescents. Fill in all the blanks left by the movie. In fact you should probably read it before viewing the film but it doesn't really matter.
B007Q476KU|2.0|Please don't read if you have not seen the movie.<br /><br />I received \\"War Horse\\" as a present and, being the consummate horse lover, was partly excited and partly wary that this movie would be about putting an innocent animal through the depravity of war. My worst fears were realized and surpassed. Unfortunately for the movie, there were so few redeeming  qualities that if I almost couldn't finish it and then when I did, regretted the waste of 2.5 hours. Very bluntly put, it was a very poor attempt at remaking Black Beauty with the backdrop of WWI as the only major difference. A beautiful horse is born, finds a good owner, and then through the cruel twist of fate is passed from owner to owner endlessly, until almost at death's door, he is re-discovered by his original owner and saved. The movie even follows Black Beauty's plot down to killing \\"Ginger\\" and the original owner discovering their long lost horse by cleaning off defining markings (Black Beauty's star, Joey's socks). The movie was so horrifically predictable at every turn that I found myself hoping to be wrong when I, yet again, guessed the cliched scene (the death of the protagonists best friend in the trenches, the death of the big black horse, etc).<br /><br />For more incongruities, the film is set in Europe and yet all the characters speak in english with accents. Are you telling me that french countrymen speak in english with french accents amongst themselves? Or that the german army spoke english with kaiser accents? I understand the difficulty of filming an entire film in a foreign language, but either do it properly with subtitles, or just have the audience accept that the characters are speaking their native tongues without the phony accents. And the girl hiding the horses in her bedroom? Did the germans search the entire house and leave her bedroom alone? And probably the worse Hollywood scene of the film was the grandfather coming all the way from the countryside because he \\"heard of the miracle horse and knew which one it was\\". What did Joey do that made him a miracle? And why could it not have been the big black instead? And how did Joey \\"save his granddaughter's life\\" as he mentioned? And what was the point of killing the granddaughter? These questions steal from the plot and potential of the movie. I could go on and on in a similar vein.<br /><br />When I saw who directly the movie at the end, I was frankly amazed. Spielberg must be losing his touch or perhaps he just no longer gives his audience any credit for the capability of spotting the many,many errors and cliches that are rife within this film. In ending, save yourself some money and read/see the classic \\"Black Beauty\\" of which this movie is a truly a ghastly doppelganger.

031618201X|5.0|Breakfast at the Loontwills' table includes gossip gleaned from the newspaper, as well as a recap of the previous evening's ball, which the young ladies attended. The paper reveals that a gruesome discovery was made in the library at that very same ball by an unnamed young lady. Funny, no one remembers any such incident. No one other than Alexia, that is. For she is the young lady in question, the recipient of an unprovoked attack by a starving vampire. Good thing that Alexia Tarabotti is more than she appears to be. She is, in fact, a preternatural!<br /><br />As if this weren't bad enough, after dispatching said vampire at said ball, Alexia pretends to faint but no one will leave her alone, and then she finds herself under the scrutiny of two of the gentlemen of B.U.R.--the Bureau of Unnatural Registration--who've come to check into things. Alexia gets along very well with Professor Lyall, but Lord Maccon is another matter entirely. They've not been on the best of terms ever since a little matter of a hedgehog...<br /><br />While taking a turn in the park with her best friend, Ivy, Alexia is accosted by an actress with an invitation--to visit a hive! It's not like the vampires to invite anyone in, so Alexia, concerned as to their motivation, seeks counsel from her vampire friend, the flamboyant Lord Akeldama. Lord A is unsure just what is going on with them; he tells her she needs all the knowledge she can acquire before venturing into enemy territory, and the best source for this would be Lord Maccon. \\"Use your... feminine wiles upon him\\" is his suggestion.<br /><br />Mysterious disappearances of the supernatural kind are becoming too commonplace in London, and both sides are concerned. Alexia is determined to get to the bottom of things, which brings her into closer and closer... contact... with Lord Maccon. And some interesting information is... revealed. But in the process, Alexia finds herself dealing with forces that are determined to use the supernatural for their own purposes.<br /><br />Will her inquisitive nature pull Alexia in over her head? And will her stubbornness prevent her from seeing what is beneath her very nose? And will Lord Maccon realize that Alexia is not an alpha female werewolf, but a very strong woman who doesn't play by werewolf rules when it comes to certain matters?<br /><br />Having read the entire Parasol Protectorate series, I admit to being apprehensive concerning the introduction of the manga. However, my fears were proven to be groundless from the beginning, as I plunged into this graphic presentation of the books and found myself instantly transported into Alexia's world.<br /><br />Naturally, not everything was as I saw it in my own mind when I read the books. Alexia is prettier than I think she should be, Lord Maccon fairer and Lord Akeldama more effeminate. But that having been said, I began to enjoy them just the way they're drawn. Especially Lord Maccon (and thank you, dear REM, for those very lovely images of his backside!) I especially enjoyed the chibi wolf scenes--they were totally adorable!<br /><br />REM has done a magnificent job of translating Gail Carriger's words into these very memorable images. I find myself picking up the book and opening it at random and simply re-reading the different scenes. And of course, no one can write Ms. Carriger the way she can. I'm grateful that no attempt was made to find another author for the manga.<br /><br />Alexia is her usual in-your-face self, which I love. Her family is still loony. Professor Lyall is a lamb (not literally, just figuratively). Lord Akeldama is not just colorful, but he is very intelligent, sensitive, and stronger than he looks (don't forget, he is vampire). Lord Maccon--what can I say? The man... er, werewolf... is sex on two legs, and where can I get one, please?<br /><br />All of the spirit of adventure, the wonderful steampunk details so carefully constructed and brought to life, the supernatural mysteries, and thesheer delight that was so characteristic of the books is very much present here. I love the cover, with Alexia's arms protectively about the snarling black wolf. I cannot say enough good things about this book.<br /><br />Whether you read the books first, and then the manga, or the other way around, be sure to read them all. I'm so looking forward to the next manga. I truly hated to see this one end, despite knowing everything that is to come. Watching it unfold before my very eyes--priceless. Dare I hope that a film is in the future? A girl can dream, right?

B006P0FIGU|3.0|I really enjoy period piece movies and the story of the Three Musketeers. My favorite version being the 1993 telling of the story starring  Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Chris O'Donnell, Oliver Platt, and Tim Curry. That version had a sense of fun, whimsical adventure which is lacking in this movie. I was very excited to see this movie because the visuals looked stunning and they certainly are. Although the story does deviate from the classic tale by Alexandre Dumas, most filmed version have taken license with the plot, just not to the extent that this current incarnation of the tale does. Having said that, my complaint is not with the story line itself just some of the mechanization of the plot; namely the use of the airship.<br /><br />I understand the need to suspend disbelief in movies such as this but the inclusion of flying airships made it a bit to difficult for me to do that at times. It just seemed so out of place and it had me rolling my eyes at times. I will say that it is very nicely designed and rendered in the film.<br /><br />My other complaint with the movie is the development of the characters. Generally in the telling of the story the main protagonist is Cardinal Richelieu. However, in this version the \\"bad guy\\" role is spread out among four characters;  Cardinal Richelieu, Captain Rochefort, the Duke of Buckingham and the Countess de Winter. With evil spread across so many characters motivations are a bit diluted. Also, the  Musketeers themselves seem bland and a bit dark and depressing for my tastes.<br /><br />Now for the positives. This movie is a feast for the eyes! The CGI in this movie is stunning and spectacular. The sets and the costumes are great and the movie really transports you to another place and time and I do like that aspect of the movie. Freddie Fox gives a very humorous and over-the-top performance of a spoiled fashion obsessed King Louis XIII. Juno Temple is equally charming and delightful as Queen Anne. The sword fights and the action scenes are also exciting and well filmed.<br /><br />Although the movie is uneven and I had trouble with parts of the film it is not a total loss for me.d the action scenes are also exciting and well filmed.<br /><br />Although the movie is uneven and I had trouble with parts of the film it is not a total loss for me.

B007V2UGPE|5.0|if you don't know who to listen to listen to this. this game is fun and has pretty good graphics. a little blood and is a little hard to control at first but when you get the hang of it the fun is endless. all who give this 1 star have not played this fun filled game.

0545265355|5.0|After watching the movie Hunger Game, I wanted to read all the books.  I found that three libraries in town had a lengthy waiting lists. I went to my local book store to purchase them and they were out of stock.  Instead of placing my name on the waiting list for new shipments to arrive, I decided to go on-line and order my books through Amazon.Com.<br /><br />Ordering my book save me time and money by not having to drive 28 miles round trip from the book store if I had added my name on the waiting list and then waited for that phone call that it was ready to be picked up.  Amazing Amazon to the rescue.  Since it took me only 5 days to read the trilogy, I now loan my books to friends and told them about your speedy service. They also decided to order their copies through your site.  Your faithful member, Joanna.

031603441X|5.0|Reading Life by Keith Richards I was impressed not only with his memory but the lack of activity at which all the rumors hint.  It was incredibly readable and enjoyable.  His insights on life will be interesting not only to fans of the Stones but anyone.

0765356147|5.0|The first two books in this series were great.  I was very excited to see how Sanderson would end what I believe is one of the best fantasy series I've ever read.  He did not disappoint.  In Hero of Ages, Sanderson took almost every single minor detail and innocent clue from the first two books and wrapped them up into an extremely satisfying and extremely unpredictable conclusion.  In the Mistborn triology Brandon Sanderson shows off a skill in writing that I've seen from very few other authors.  The books are so well thought out, planned, and paced that it almost makes it seem that you are reading an actual account of things that really happened instead of reading a fantasy novel.  Sanderson is without a doubt one of my new favorite authors.  I'm looking forward to reading the rest of his work.
B002NEFL8W|5.0|I absolutely love having this grip. I have larger hands and the camera just sits so much better in both orientations. The only problem I have is that I became so used to using the multi-directional pad on the camera body, that it's difficult for my to change focus points while holding in portrait orientation. This issue is, of course, addressed in the 5D MIII, but until I can make that upgrade, I will have to live with the old-school, dual wheel adjustment method. I do wish there was a weather-sealing strip along the connection point to the camera base to keep dust out, but it hasn't been a major problem so far. Another issue is that the camera lasts so long on dual batteries, that I have forgotten backup batteries several times.<br /><br />Highly recommended. I'm trying to force my apprentice to buy one when he gets his own 7D.
0312330537|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. It was full of excitment and adventure.  The plot and story has many exciting twists and turns and other stories within the book.  I loved the bits of wisdom at the end of each chapter as the main character reflects on the past adventure and what he has learned and how its changes his thoughts and life.  Its a wonderful escape to a bewildering and exciting country and adventure!
B007CKNX28|3.0|As a huge fan of the White Stripes I was anxiously awaiting this album, and after seeing his performance on Saturday Night Live I couldn't wait to get my hands on it.  Well, I wanted to give myself two full days of listening before writing a review so I could shed myself of any expectations/first impressions.<br /><br />That being said I have to say the first seven tracks are amazing.  \\"Sixteen Saltines\\", \\"Love Interruption\\", \\"Blunderbuss\\", and \\"Hypocritical Kiss\\" are by far my favorites on the album.  However, after that it sounds more like a musician trying to find his solo sound.  I appreciate what he's trying to do in these songs, but it sounds like they're missing something.<br /><br />If this would have been a seven track album I would have given it 5/5, but I had to drop down to 3 for the second half.  I'm anxious to see what he does in the future as he further matures his solo sound.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|Product works as advertised. I had another bottle cutter that was worthless.<br />Amazingly easy and swift.  I haven't done 9 bottles like other reviewer, but so far, so good.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|To be honest, at first, I didn't care for all the hype of the walking dead, it sounded like every other zombie film ever made, and then I actually watched it, and it blew my mind. The whole concept is astoundingly shot where you start to think about what ifs... some scenes make you want to puke, others pull on your heart strings it is a fantastic series and with actors that fit the comic to the point its creepy. I bought this after I found I liked it, and worried that it might not be worth it, I found it totally is. Granted the first season is only 6 episodes but there is so much bonus footage I don't feel ripped off at all. Great deal, and the spammer who said the section where they chop the guy up, isn't there, it absolutely is, so he or she got a defective purchase, or is just being a noob. Though I would go with the second, I have never once regretted a buy on Amazon. Buy it, it is a steal!

B0000A0DRY|5.0|Jefferson Airplane's second studio album was recorded October 31 - November 22, 1966 in RCA Victor's Music Center, Hollywood, California and released in February 1967 in both mono and stereo versions. This is the stereo version with six bonus songs (actually 7 as one's a hidden bonus song). This was Grace Slick and Spencer Dryden's first album with the band. The Grateful Dead's Jerry Garcia was responsible for the album title as well as appearing on several of the songs although producer Rick Jarrard denies this. Given the fact that members of the Airplane say he was on there, he's on outtakes, and you can clearly hear his early '67 sound. Jerry Garcia plays electric on Today, acoustic on Comin' Back To Me and Plastic Fantastic Lover. The Grateful Dead also recorded their first album about a month later in the same studio with the same engineer who also produced the Dead's first album. The album, Surrealistic Pillow, represents the counterculture movement of the 1960's but has held up surprisingly well and much of it is still feels very relevant today.<br /><br />The albums starts off with Marty Balin/Jorma Kaukonen's She Has Funny Cars complete with a driving beat, great vocals, sharp guitars and Jack Casady's wonderful fuzz bass. Somebody To Love is a song that Grace brought with her from her last band The Great Society which would become one of the Airplane's biggest hits still turning up on the radio today. My Best Friend was written by Skip Spence who left and would help form Moby Grape. Marty Balin/Paul Kantner turn in a beautiful song called Today which gives way to Marty Balin's wonderful Comin' Back To Me with Grace contributing a pretty recorder part to the song. Marty Balin's 3/5 of a Mile in 10 Seconds starts the second half of the album off on a flying start. Paul Kantner turns in one of my favorites of his with D.C.B.A. -25. How Do You Feel features nice group vocals with Grace turning in another nice recorder part. While I do like later Airplane albums too, I do wish they would've included more of the acoustic/recorder elements we hear here. Speaking of acoustic, Jorma's Embryonic Journey is nothing short of amazing! Grace turns in White Rabbit inspired by Alice In Wonderland and...well...other things. It has a nice electric Spanish feel and would become the band's other best known song. Marty's Plastic Fantastic Lover starts with a slashing acoustic guitar before giving way to a driving beat.<br /><br />The bonus songs here have mostly appeared elsewhere but actually do fit well here as they're from the same sessions. In The Morning, J.P.P. McStep B. Blues (both with Jerry Garcia) and Go To Her appeared on 1974's Early Flight. Come Back Baby is quite good but not as drawn out as it would be later on. The mono single versions of Somebody To Love and White Rabbit are next with an instrumental version of D.C.B.A.-25 as a hidden bonus track. I've noticed that some people have commented on the sound quality of this edition but it sounds very good to me. The original album production always had a bit of echo and the instruments were probably recorded mostly live as they were back then with the vocals then overdubbed. This isn't quite as noticeable on vinyl but stands out more on cd because of higher resolution. This was probably recorded on either a two track machine or three track at most, which limits what can be done, restoration wise.s too, I do wish they would've included more of the acoustic/recorder elements we hear here.

B004EPYZV2|4.0|MIGP is my favorite mission impossible movie barely going beyond MI3.  I really wasn't expecting it but I was pleasantly surprised with the action and the acting.<br />If you liked the movie the blu ray is definitely the way to go.  Top quality here.<br />The video looks great with a very sharp, clear, and deep picture with only a scene or two of light fuzz.  I would give video a 9/10.  The audio work is amazing as well.  The dialogue comes in crystal clear and the there are quite a few moments in the movie that gives your bass a workout.  The audio direction is fantastic.  Just listen when tom is chasing the bad guy through the sandstorm.  That really stood out to me. A 10/10 for me for the audio.<br />I can't really say that I was impressed with the amount of special features that the movie offers, however.  There are only a few features that explain a bit on how different parts of the movie were made.  What is here, however is quite good and interesting to watch if you're a fan of the movie.  I just wanted more.  I didn't find a commentary track either which bummed me out.<br />In short, I would recommend this blu ray to anyone who enjoyed the movie.  It has an amazing audio/video presentation that is worth owning.  I just wish it had more features.
B0014JGDUC|4.0|This will definitely keep my feet cool and dry this summer. I wore it for a week when it was in the 80s to give it a test run. A few things first. These definitely run larger. Probably 1/2 to 3/4 of a size larger. So, if you're in between sizes, go a size down. Keep in mind, if you're not going to be wearing socks, you'll definitely want to size down if you're in between sizes.<br /><br />Another issue is that after 3 days of wearing these (12 hour days in a kitchen), the top left part of my left foot was becoming extra sensitive due to scraping.<br /><br />I decided to punch the holes on the side to keep my feet ventilated. Without the holes there, my foot was getting really hot & sweaty. With the holes in place, it made a world of difference!<br /><br />Grease & water weren't an issue. The grip was very comparable to your average restaurant shoes. The only time I had issues was when the entire floor was completely soaked. But then again, that's with most shoes.
B002RI9S2Y|5.0|i absolutely LOVE this book!!i could NOT stop reading this!i finished in less than 1 hour! THAT'S how consuming this is! i highly recommend this to everyone that likes fiction and adventure( ^0^)

B000SEGQNS|3.0|Pictures inside the kindle book are pretty blur, that make it impossible to read some important text. Please put clearer pictures. We don't care the download size the book to be a little bigger.<br /><br />The content also need UPDATE. Taglines have disappeared from many sites. All web pages in the book changed their look dramatically; some even changed owners. We need a updated book for today's new styles.
B006O5Y75Y|5.0|Initially, this movie did not hold much interest for me.  I was never a huge fan of planet of the apes.  This movies story line and special effects quickly made me do a 180 on my opinion.  Very well done and I was riveted until the credits rolled.
B002EAKWEI|5.0|Great dvd to have, you will not be disappointed. If your a fan of Sherlock Holmes you will love this dvd box set.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I think the book is well written. I do not like the story as a whole or the plot. I think it is cruel. I am afraid many teens will read it and it is sad. It is definetly not the next \\"Harry Potter\\" and I am not a fan of Harry Potter.

B0015AARJI|5.0|As always, I order a new PS3 controller every 6 to 7 months. Not because they break down but after months of use, any left over grease on my fingers (or friends) ends up making the controller a bit waxy to feel, even after cleaning.<br /><br />So I bought a new PS3 controller, without noticing the seller name I figured all of them were of the same type. This is not to be held true however.<br />Today I received a PS3 Dualshock 3 controller from A THIRD PARTY SOURCE. That seller was Exporter and the product is clearly a rip off of Sony PS3's dualshock controllers.<br /><br />The box the controller resides in clearely looks like one but if you notice the controller and text on the box it is not an official controller.<br />What the controller looks like:<br />No SONY logo on controller<br />No Playstation logo on middle PS Button (instead it has P3)<br />The Square, Triangle, Circle, and X buttons are all coming out too far<br />The entire thing looks like cheap plastic<br /><br />Do NOT buy from Exporter if you're looking for official products.<br /><br />##############<br /><br />Alright, aside from my rant the Dualshock 3 controllers always have and always will be the best way to game on your PS3 system. Not only are they still relatively light, even with that rumble pack in there, but they allow you to have a whole new sense while your gaming. That feeling of live feedback while you game will always keep you on the edge of your seat. And for those of you that dont enjoy that little buzz, you can actually turn off that via the settings on your PS3.
0345803485|3.0|I enjoyed the book, which offered passion, seduction, and the taboo; yet I wasn't completely enveloped by it. I recommend a thrilling book that not only has wild romance and intense emotion, but also some facets such as espionage, and the struggle of mankind and power. I suggest A Rendezvous with Destiny, by Julian X.

B004SUWR2C|1.0|bought this app for $.49 and its terrible. Did the registration and it won't recognize me. Music is loud and annoying. Can't do anything except play the game alone. Deleted it and gave $.49 to chatity.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I bought The Hunger Games Trilogy after watching the first movie. The movie was pretty good all around, so I thought that the book might help me get a deeper insight into the whole world and it did.<br /><br />All three books are incredibly addicting. I couldn't stop reading and having the trilogy in one e-book makes it so that as soon as you finish one you can immediately turn the page to start the next one (I can't even think what those who read the books whenever they were originally published felt, as waiting a year to know what happens next would tear me apart).<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend them. They are a fantastic story for teenagers and young adults.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Fun brings back the super Mario experience almost! Its free so why mot!!<br />Try it if you remember a quarter in the machine and play Mario all night at the local 7-11 for one quarter!!!!!! Ah the good old days!!

B007TMON8M|5.0|best app ever.  i loved this game on my cousins ipad.  im thrilled that i can get it on my kindle now
0061914177|1.0|I have no idea who this book was intended for. Is this book an autobiography, or intended for entrepreneurs and small-business owners? One-third to one-half of the book was self-congratulatory and long-winded. The latter half of the book was very generalized and commonsense. The book does not provide detail. You are better off reading Scott Fox's book called Internet Riches or other books mentioned by another Amazon reader by the name of Jeff Lippincott from Princeton, New Jersey. He gives detailed reviews - you should read his bio. I have read at least two dozen books that Jeff has reviewed (he knows what he is talking about), that I don't need to waste my time writing detailed reviews. Crush It! is overrated and those 5 star reviews are so bogus you can not rely on the Amazon's rating system anymore, to bad.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is extremely addictive. I often find myself spending hours at a time playing on this game. if I were to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate it a 9 because some of the times on there are awkward like 3:30am on a Wednesday morning
B005C9YZIW|5.0|If you have a Blu-ray player, this is well worth the money, I bought the original 4 disc set on HDDVD, when it 1st came out, so I misses it when my HDDVD went out, because I payed $99 for it. It was nice to find a 6 disc set at a very reasonable price. I enjoy this set.'<br /><br />Michael

B007IX383I|5.0|Perfect Music! The last 2 anathema albums have been flawless. This band has reached a new creative peak and hopefully it will stay that way for a while. Not one bad moment on this album imo.
1466401885|5.0|This story ensnared my emotions. I willingly went on an emotional roller coaster ride with both of the main characters, Abby and Travis. I thought the situations and feelings they experienced rang true. I kept fearing that I wouldn't get my happy ending, as this couple had the odds stacked against them. I was surprised to feel that I would still love the book even if there was a tragic ending, because I had so enjoyed the journey. I can't say that about many books I've read, where the happy ending is a forgone conclusion and that's the only way I would want it. I just finished the 50 Shades trilogy, and although I really enjoyed them, I liked this book even more. For me, the descriptions of Abby and Travis's deep emotional as well as physical connection resonated deep within me. Beautiful Disaster is a book I will re-read and savor again!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is awesome I'm owning it rite now I am officially addicted to this game. 1 on my list of games
0545265355|5.0|Bought this set right after movie came out. Nice set for all 3 books. Hardcover. Colorful book coat. Like it
B007MJKOY4|1.0|The story is necessarily simplified but most of the changes do not make sense. It is not clear why some elements from the book are retained and some not, because the storyline is fragmented and difficult to follow. Very bad direction and editing.
B007SGM084|1.0|Why is it cheaper to purchase each book separately for the Kindle than it is to buy the package?  Granted it's just a few cents but it's still cheaper.  I also agree with some others who thinks it's too expensive for a download.
B002JF1N0A|5.0|For someone who has a great fascination for the theory of evolution (despite being a Software Engineer) I realized that it's unacceptable, not to mention a little hypocritical that I had yet not read On the Origin of Species by the great man Charles Darwin. Yes I had devoted a lot of time to learn the theory which is how I was captivated by the simple elegance of the theory, but I needed to read the original work itself. After all, I believe, nay, I am sure of it, that this is one of the most profound ideas in the history of mankind and I was curious what the actual work was like. I was pretty sure it was going to be a lot complex.<br /><br />I was in for a surprise though.<br /><br />For one of the greatest books ever written, On the Origin of Species is also remarkably simple. So much so that I am pretty sure any fifteen year old kid who has had a reasonable education should not have a problem understanding it. Darwin never goes into complex stuff, instead he tries to explain with evidence the phenomena you see all around you. It's simple, it's also enjoyable.<br /><br />Also, contrary to popular belief there is very little about human evolution in it as well. If fact, there is only one line, but I also think it is the best line in the whole book;<br /><br />\\"Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.\\"<br /><br />Cheeky, witty and brilliant.<br /><br />I highly recommend everyone read this book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|so fun would love to get higher level in this game. would recommend it to anyone. the video in the movie is hilarous
B007V2UGPE|5.0|It is a very fun game, but items get really expensive really fast. Otherwise I have no problems with this game.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|If you like Mario. you will love this game. As soon as I started playing it I was hooked. I cant put it down. The graphics are worthy of any video game
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love this addiction<br />every one should try it get addicted and play I love it see you all in Oregon on the home front.Ps do not get dysintary on the way and die
B0044DEAUA|5.0|This is quite a nice product. My friend at the other end feedback to me that my sound is very clear and he did not noticed that I was using the speakerphone. The microphone is a directional one. The best postion when mounting the device is to align the microphone hole with your mouth. The sound from other directions are attenuated somehow. This is a useful design consideration which make your voice clear in a noisy environment.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|I would love it if u could control yourself more and u didn't have to actually buy stuff to win or at least easier
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|real fun game until the timers set to days rather than minutes and your &quot;energy &quot; wont refill unless the game is open (which it didn't require before)
0307279189|5.0|I'm glad this book was recommended to me.  There was a thrill and feeling of personal adventure that went along with reading about the feats of endurance undertaken with the ultra-distance races described.  It made me want to run and although I think that I'll always plod along at short distances the book is an inspiration at keeping me out there pounding the pavement.  Dream along with other readers and runners as the author delves deep into the mystique and history of distance running.  Learn about shoes, injuries, and the personalities behind some of the greatest races ever performed.  Even if you are not a runner you will probably find the book interesting and a page turner.
B003TJR2HS|1.0|Worked a few times use then stopped working. Very delicate product. For me it wasn't worth it - not a very durable product so I returned it. Too bad because I really liked it when it worked.

0385534639|1.0|This book was selected as my book group book and I was prepared to like it since I generally like the genre.  It was very slow, boring and confusing.  I did not like the way the book jumped from story to story and time to time.  While this worked for \\"A Visit from the Goon Squad\\", in this case it didn't, probably because the chapters weren't long enough.  The characters were poorly developed, the love story was not interesting, and the ending was vague.  How much better it would have been if A.H. and Prospero had been ancient historical characters, like druids or philosophers.  This would have given them more depth and mystery.
B001VNB54A|5.0|I'm a HUGE Band Of Brothers fan and, at first, I was a little disappointed with the different format used with The Pacific.  It seemed difficult to really get to know the characters as we could with Band of Brothers.  But, after watching the series I place it as my second all-time favorite movie.  A very close second to Band of Brothers.
0345803485|1.0|Cliches run rampant and being controlled is not my fantasy no matter how good looking someone is. This creepy man was horribly molested at 16 and because he was a boy at 16 and forced to be a submissive by his mothers friend it seems some people think that is okay. I find despicable. I couldn't even finish it as it left me feeling horribly disgusted.

B001DJLD1M|5.0|The newest edition contains 4 seperately labeled DVD's in a nice plastic case.  Much better I would think than the non labeled double sided versions of the past.<br /><br />All of them functioned perfectly and are the wide screen setup.  There are a few extra commentaries along with scene features that some might enjoy.  I just wanted the movies, so there is not much else to say.  A great price for an even greater legendary series.<br /><br />kd

B005ZOBNOI|2.0|Boy, do I have a feeling I'm going to provoke a lot of anger among the Nerdfighter community with this. All I ask is that you hear me out.<br /><br />I've read all of John Green's full-length, independently written novels (opting to skip all the collaborations and side projects). I find him to be a mostly charming, witty writer, but I've never obsessed over him the way his impressive legion of fans (called Nerdfighters) have. Clearly, I've enjoyed him enough to keep checking in every time he's published a new book, but there have been enough flaws or annoyances to keep me a little jaded about the experience. The Fault in Our Stars may have officially tipped the scales against Green for me. It's the first time I've really found myself irritated by a Green novel.<br /><br />I'm going to insert a disclaimer here before anyone tries to accuse me of lacking sensitivity for people who are terminally ill. Both of my parents have had, or still have, cancer at the time of this writing. My partner lost his mother to cancer. I also had a beloved aunt who spent the first twenty-three years of my life fighting recurrences of cancer before succumbing (in fact, I was never actually supposed to meet her, since she was given roughly six months to live upon her initial diagnosis--which was six years before I was even born). I've worn a Live Strong bracelet on my wrist every day for the last seven years to remind me of their struggles and the importance of really living every single day. Furthermore, I count [[ASIN:0571198775 Wit: A Play]] among my favorite books and Terms of Endearment reduced me to emotional rubble (seriously, I can't even watch it. I cried so hard I made ludicrous, hiccupy snuffling noises that made me glad no one was there to witness it).<br /><br />So please believe me when I say that when I found the protagonists (Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters) of The Fault in Our Stars irritating, it had nothing to do with their illnesses and everything to do with the way Green constructed their personalities. I'll get to my problems with the plot itself at the end.<br /><br />Green has an upstanding history of creating lovable nerds. He is an author who really understands and celebrates the underdog--the so-called \\"losers\\" of the world. It's why his fan community is known as Nerdfighters (not to mention why he has such a massive fan community at all). He's subverting the paradigm that being intelligent or \\"weird\\" is wrong (if Glee were capable of consistent storytelling it would be spreading the same message on TV every week). But here's the thing: in all of his other books I've believed in his over-articulate outcasts without an incredible suspension of disbelief. I don't believe in Hazel and Augustus the same way. Their dialogue is at best contrived, at worst cloying and, well, ridiculous.<br /><br />I chalk this down to the fact that Hazel and Augustus are worth more to Green as Metaphors than as characters. Everything they do has to be Significant and Important and Meaningful. The main plotpoint, where they embark on a quest to find the author of Hazel's favorite book (which famously lacks closure) so they can find out what happens after the last sentence, is a rather obvious metaphor for their fear of death. For goodness' sake, Hazel can't even eat breakfast without opining about how eggs are the victims of typecasting. \\"I mean seriously,\\" she intones, \\"How did scrambled eggs get stuck with breakfast exclusivity? You can put bacon on a sandwich without anyone freaking out. But the moment your sandwich has an egg, boom, it's a breakfast sandwich ... I don't want to have 'breakfast for dinner' ... I want to have scrambled eggs for dinner without this ridiculous construction that a scrambled egg-inclusive meal is breakfast even when it occurs at dinnertime.\\"* Do you get it, you guys? THE EGG IS A METAPHOR. I just blew your mind, didn't I? It's OK, take a second if you need to.<br /><br />Augustus is, if possible, even moreobviously cratered with Metaphors. His desire to die heroically is repeatedly signified by his obsession with sacrificing his virtual life in video games instead of winning the game (then, irritatingly, Green feels the need to explain it toward the end anyway Just In Case You Missed It). He's the kind of guy who likes to keep an unlit cigarette between his lips, and will gladly explain it's metaphorical significance to you if you ask politely (\\"You put the killing thing right between your teeth, but you don't give it the power to do its killing.\\"), prompting Hazel to remark that he chooses his behaviors based on their metaphorical resonance and Fall Irrevocably In Love With Him.<br /><br />And there's the other problem I have with Augustus and Hazel: their romance feels like a plot construction far more than it feels like a natural stars-crossed Passion For The Ages. In Green's other books, I believed that Miles fell for self-destructive Alaska, I believed that Margo Roth Spiegelman captivated Quentin Jacobsen enough to make him search for her after she disappeared (in [[ASIN:0142402516 Looking for Alaska]] and [[ASIN:014241493X Paper Towns]] respectively). There was something about their force-of-nature presence that made it believable that someone like Miles or Quentin would be lured in. But Augustus Waters just shows up in Hazel's cancer support group and stares at her like Creepy McCreeperson and she just swoons at him. I'm sorry, that's almost as bad as Bella Swan falling in love with Edward Cullen even though he apparently hates her and is stalking her outside her bedroom window. Green attempts to play it cool by having Hazel recognize that she'd be creeped out if it were an ugly guy staring at her, but that doesn't make their love affair any less sudden or any less inexplicable. The plot won't work if they aren't in love, so reason be damned, and there it is: love at first sight.<br /><br />And that brings us to my problems with the plot itself.<br /><br />Observation: repeatedly beginning lines of dialogue in which your characters are supposed to make an Important Observation about Life As We All Know It with \\"Observation: ...\\" gets old, especially when the Observation(:) is as trite as \\"standing in line is a form of oppression.\\" Observation: Random Acts of Capitalization don't make your writing endearing or quirky. Please To Stop.<br /><br />Nevermind the fact that all the peripheral characters are completely flat (definitely an accusation I never expected to make about John Green)--if they don't matter to the author, why should they matter to us? That the plot is dully predictable is a greater offense to me. The \\"plot twist\\" recurrence, the acceptance of fate, the lessons learned by the protagonist at the end ... you see it all coming a mile away.<br /><br />The strength of The Fault in Our Stars is that it refuses to offer false comfort regarding a subject matter that does not have any happy ending: we are all going to die, but we live our lives pretending that words like \\"forever\\" or \\"always\\" have meaning (think of Isaac's subplot in re: the latter word). I suspect this is a new concept for many people; maybe that's why it resonates with so many readers. Perhaps I'm more morbid than your average person, but it was nothing new for me. And it's been done better (the aforementioned Wit for one). The Fault in Our Stars wants to have it both ways: it wants to reflect the harsh realities of impermanence and death, but it wants to leave the reader feeling good in the end. Consider that the book Hazel loves so much is lauded for remaining honest through its complete lack of closure, but Green provides us with a full denouement and conclusion. It derides cheap sentimentality, then uses it as a crutch to make the reader Feel Something. In the end you just can't have it both ways, and that's why The Fault in Our Stars is a failure to me.<br /><br />Grade: D+<br /><br />*\\"breakfast exlusivity?\\" WHO TALKS LIKE THAT?! You can tell me that these kids have been forced into early adulthood due to their circumstances until you're blue in the face and I won't buy it.

B000031WX2|5.0|Death is one of my most influential bands of all time. Chuck's writing ability is just simply outstanding. This CD in particular has really good tracks, from number 1 to 8. You can listen to this album all the way through and every song is filled with pure Death emotion and heavy guitar riffs. You can hear the whole band like you should. I've been playing bass for 7 years in a Metal band and we actually based our instrument volume in recording sessions off of this album. Simply amazing CD i recommend buying this to anyone that enjoys Metal, not just Death metal. The lyrics to Chuck's songs are amazing  pieces of literature in my opinion. You read a few songs, you will find out that Chuck's lyrics are probably some of the best. I love this album and i was pleased to find it a decent price so i can add it to my collection.

Here they delve into the Jazz genre which, in its many forms since the advent of R&R in the mid-1950s, was never a genre which saw a single routinely climb into the higher regions of the various Pop charts, unlike Country and R&B which boasted frequent cross-overs from their devoted charts.<br /><br />But every now and then a pure Jazz tune would score high, as  evidenced by hits by the likes of: bongo player/percussionist Mongo Santamaria, pianists Andr&eacute; Previn, Ray Bryant and Count Basie, organists Jimmy Smith, Richard \\"Groove\\" Holmes and Jimmy McGriff, saxophonists Moe Koffman, Stan Getz, Julian \\"Cannonball\\" Adderley, Les Elgart and Johnny Dankworth, guitarist Charlie Byrd, drummer Cozy Cole, and trombonist Chris Barber.<br /><br />Add to that illustrious group the name of pianist Dave Brubeck who, leading his quartet (bassist Eugene Wright, alto saxophonist Paul Desmond and drummer Joe Morello), recorded this great album at Columbia's 30th Street Studios in New York in June, July and August of 1959 and when it was released it not only drew high praise from the usual Jazz publications, but struck a chord with a buying public that spread way beyond the small but devoted Jazz fan base. So much so that, in 1961, Columbia release Take Five - done in 5/4 time - as a single b/w Blue Rondo A La Turk (Columbia 41479) and saw it go as high as # 25 Billboard Pop Hot 100 that September.<br /><br />That tune in fact, with its clever solos by members of the Quartet, led to a whole new appreciation of Jazz amongst non-traditional audiences, with many more hits to follow by the artists mentioned above. And you'll love Paul Desmond's sax on Everybody's Jumpin' as well as the magic of Wright and Morello.<br /><br />The sound quality is excellent, there are liner notes by Dave Brubeck and renowned British Jazz pianist/historian, the late Steve Race, and the price is right.<br /><br />Dave, now 92, and Eugene \\"The Senator\\" Wright, now 89, are both still with us, while Paul Desmond passed away at age 53 on May 30, 1977 from lung cancer, and Joe Morello at age 82 on March 12, 2011, apparently from natural causes.

I didn't read a single synopsis. I just kept stumbling upon the title and in a moment of (drunken) nonchalance, I downloaded it to my Kindle. I'm very glad I did. It was a very fun story to read. I, for one, really, thoroughly enjoyed the power dynamic between Ana and Christian. I was very disappointed, when I reached the end (which was very abrupt, in my opinion), that there was not more to read.<br /><br />Say what you will about the sex, the bondage, the writing, etc. Compare to whoever you like.

B006UG90RM|4.0|I like the album; it's a good comeback and a solid, not spectacular effort. It's everything the fans should expect from Van Halen, and looking back at the band's history, it's a wonder any new music was ever released. I've always loved VH, but my expectations have been tempered by all the negative press and infighting, so I'm pleasantly surprised how good this really is. I'm selfish; I don't want the band to change from their glory years. I just want to hear some rock and roll.<br /><br />Sonically, ADKOT is completely awesome and a return to form. DLR is hyperkinetic fun. His range has decreased, but he's still funny and an undeniable showman. Eddie and Alex sound as good as ever, rehab must have been good for them. I miss Michael Anthony's harmonies more than his bass. My favorite rockers on the album are Bullethead, Chinatown, and Big River, but Stay Frosty is my favorite cut. Frosty is a song only the DLR-led VH could write and perform, no other band could. It's fun, silly, and still rocks. Beats Workin' is a worthy anthem and aptly describes their whole philosophy.<br /><br />If this is an attempt to recreate their 1978-84 magic, it doesn't absolutely succeed but is still close enough to qualify as kick-ass rock and roll. Real rock has been painfully absent for a long time. \\"Chant it like a Mantra.\\" Thanks Guys!

B007IX383I|5.0|Weather Systems is a phenomenal album.  Is it better than We're Here Because We're Here?  I can't say.  The album as a whole is truly something awesome to be experienced.  Weather Systems features lots of incredibly beautiful guitar handpicking on tracks like Untouchable Pt 1, Gathering Of The Clouds, Lightning Song and Sunlight.  Other highlights include Untouchable pt. 2 (a sort of mellow cover of Untouchable Pt. 1), The Beginning and The End and the closing track Internal Landscapes which leaves the listener in a deep sense of peace.<br /><br />The album's weakest moment, in my opinion, is the first part of The Storm Before The Calm.  It just sounds like something off of a bad pop song.  The second part of the song thankfully redeems this flaw with sweeping vocals and enchanting orchestral movements.<br /><br />Overall, this album is really good and totally worth your money.  If you liked We're Here Because We're Here, there is no reason you wouldn't like this.  It may be a little different, and it may take some getting used to, but it's still a solid Anathema release.

B004FRX0MY|2.0|UPDATE September 25, 2013: Since first using this with my old (and long gone) Droid X this software has deteriorated in one big way. On my Samsung Galaxy Note II I just discovered that this software downloads your music to the phone's internal memory and there is no workaround. So my new 64gb card is next to useless when I am purchasing MP3 albums from Amazon (which also sold me the 64gb SD card.) This is truly a brain dead piece of software for folks who frequently purchase MP3 albums. Factor that into your decision to download this and purchase MP3 music from Amazon. It's a no-win situation.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />No doubt this is a convenient application and has made my Droid X my best friend (not to mention my dramatically increased number of purchases of MP3 albums from Amazon!)<br /><br />What I love most: cloud storage, and the fact that any MP3 music purchased from Amazon is stored for free, regardless of how much space it takes up. I also love the fact that whenever I purchase a new album it's immediately available to play from the cloud or to download directly to my Droid X.<br /><br />Now for the bad: if I am playing music for hours my device will freeze and I have to force the application to close. And when I say my device freezes, I mean everything until I get a pop-up informing me of such and asking if I want to wait, cancel or force it closed.<br /><br />Another issue I have is when I am downloading MP3 albums that come as disc 1 and 2 (or more), each virtual disc names the tracks with a number, then title. So when they download, virtual disc 1, track 1 downloads, then virtual disc 2, track 1 follows, and so on for every track. The track list is seriously out of order. This is a problem Amazon needs to resolve, even if it means a different naming convention for tracks from multiple virtual discs (i.e., disc 1 would be A-1-track name, and disc 2 would be B-1-track name or some similar scheme. It is not insurmountable.<br /><br />As for accessing my music from the cloud - I have scant luck playing songs from the cloud when I am driving and it's hit or miss at home unless I have WiFi turned on, so I am forced to play from songs stored on my device when I am not near WiFi. I have more music stored in the cloud than my phone will hold, which is why it can be a pain, but I think that may be a limitation of my provider (Verizon) instead of any shortcoming with Amazon. Just be aware that it can be an issue of the underlying technology, including your service provider's infrastructure.<br /><br />Despite my complaints, I have reached the point where I cannot live without the app, so I guess liking it is optional.ing my music from the cloud - I have scant luck playing songs from the cloud when I am driving and it's hit or miss at home unless I have WiFi turned on, so I am forced to play from songs stored on my device when I am not near WiFi.

B006P8KKYW|5.0|Haven't seen the movie yet, but got the soundtrack about the same time I started reading the book. Like the trilogy, the music keeps drawing me in despite the extremely disturbing subject matter. The music isn't unpleasant in the same way, but it stirs up recollections of and emotions provoked by the novel that could drive one to despair without a solid faith in the better side of humanity. On the other hand, the music is full of repeated motifs that create familiarity over the 3-hour journey and has sonic textures that will make synth heads perk up their ears. Gets better with each listen.

6305882592|5.0|Harold and Maude is a hilariously dark, well-shot excursion into figuring out how to live. Wes Anderson borrowed basically his entire style from this movie. The dark tinge, the slow motion, the brilliantly choreographed indie soundtrack. The two leads in this film are pitch-perfect, particularly a young and beguiling Bud Cort whose suicide attempts are movie comic gold (a weird sentence, I know). Take one instance when his mother organizes a blind date. Mommy dearest and the date are foregrounded in the ornate dining room as Harold wanders around in the yard beyond, covering himself in gauze and gasoline and apparently lighting himself ablaze. The date reacts with appropriate horror just as Harold emerges to shake her hand. The scene doesn't sound funny on paper, but it is a gut-splitter. So too, Harold floating in a pool, Harold methodically loading a handgun as his Mom fills out dating paperwork for her pious preferences. And who can forget Harold and Maude meandering from funeral to funeral? Maude is a free-spirit, an ancient whimsical creation despite horrors of her past explained in a flash late in the film. She is a perfect counterpart to Harold. They are arguably the best on-screen couple in history. The only scene that is a bit too wacky is the scene in which Harold eludes his war-hawk uncle by seemingly murdering Maude (this is never mentioned again and seems slightly cartoonish that he got away with it scott-free). This minor snafu aside, the film is a wonder, beautiful and grim in equal measure.  Any fan of Wes Anderson owes it to themselves to see it, and see it more than once.
0449000729|5.0|My interest in historical fiction developed while we lived in Ireland and made many visits to Europe.  My first reading of Sarum, about 25 years ago, was a result of a visit to the area; and I still consider it the best book I've ever read.  The characters and history came alive for me.  I particularly enjoyed following family lines generation after generation from the ice age to the present.  Learning how the landscape and the people developed and changed is fascinating.  Rutherford has a wonderful way of describing their lives and their motivations.<br /><br />Since that time, I've read several other Rutherford books as well as books by Auel, Follet, & Michener.  Each one was interesting and informative, but Sarum remains my all-time favorite.  Perhaps because it was my first historical fiction and made me fall in love with history.

0765316994|5.0|REDSHIRTS' premise, on the face of it, is comedic. It makes me remember the exchange from Big Bang Theory, that we know we're not in the Matrix because the food would taste better. In this case, we know we're not in the real world because the guy in the red shirt ALWAYS dies on the away mission.<br /><br />It's a fun, fast, satisfying read - but then, something happens. The ending, much as in life, is NOT the ending. Three Codas examine the other side of the story, the effect of the fictional world on the real world. How fiction informs it, reforms it, improves it. It's in the Codas that REDSHIRTS becomes more than a nifty logic puzzle with pulse guns. In the end, it's a thank you to the people who imagine - and who share their imaginings with a world in need of them. While they're not our creators (probably!) they do more for us than they, or we, can ever know.

0061777269|5.0|A very comprehensive account of Near Death Experiences and the science behind it. Dr. Van Lommel, who is well respected in the field of cardiology and the field of NDE's, digs deep here and presents a solid, convincing argument for life beyond death.<br /><br />Even though the book features a large section on science, it's written for the layman, ie. anyone with basic common sense should be able to grasp the arguments presented here.<br /><br />The book is well written and presented, to the point and deserves to be taken seriously. For NDE newcomers, this book would be a great place to start. I've read a substantial amount of NDE literature and can safely say that this book is one of the best on NDE's. Highly recommended.

0439023513|5.0|SPOILERS AHEAD!!!<br /><br />Like many others, I absolutely loved the first two books. While reading Mockingjay I was at first very put off by how the book was unfolding- slow, jumpy, Katniss- our super strong hero- becoming a pawn and sedated over and over. It's not how we want our hero to be. But what can we realistically expect from a hero who has lived through the trauma and violence that she has? Her behavior, and that of the other characters, brought back very real memories for me. A close relative of mine was sent to Iraq while he was in the Army. When he came back, many of his behaviors (nightmares, blackouts, hallucinations, etc.) are what Katniss and the other characters experience in the book. I realized that the book, and the actions of the characters, makes sense. This is what happens when people are put through unspeakable horrors. That's the point of the book, to make us feel uncomfortable and put off. We are meant to be nauseated by war. We are meant to abhor violence. It's meant to make us take a serious, hard look at the world.<br /><br />I personally think Suzanne Collins was brilliant in how she did this- we all fell in love with Katniss, and we want her to be happy and have the fairy tale ending. So at the end when her world is destroyed, we should be mad at what happened to her and why it happens. Not the author!! There was no chance for a happy ending once she volunteered. No one walking into that situation can be happy. That's why we find out how all the other tributes were living lives of psychological torment. It has taken my relative almost 10 years to start to put some of his life back together. This is reality. There are no happy endings in war. There are just endings, and you have to try to move on. You can find peace, but it takes time, and you can never go back to who you were.<br /><br />In the end, Katniss ended up trying to put war behind her, and in doing so she embraced love. This is symbolized by who she ends up with. It's the only possible outcome, the only choice, considering all she went through. Gale and Peeta represent two different lives, two different futures, war and love. It makes sense why Katniss gets mad at Gale. She is repelled from the fight in him because she can't handle being associated with any more death. I really commend Suzanne Collins for writing it the way she did. So while I am still feeling sick over it, I am also really impressed with it. Thank you for the wake up call. Hopefully it will help our children learn that war only destroys, and we have to find a better way if we are to survive.

B0007Y08IS|2.0|Team America: World Police (2004) is Trey Parker and Matt Stone's ambitious attempt to create an R-rated comedy composed of puppets and marionettes. Like the South Park Movie, Team America is a satire on American politics. And like that movie, it is simply not funny. In most cases, it's not even good.<br /><br />That's not to say Parker and Stone don't deserve credit for trying something new. In fact, Team America tries to be everything: a satire on the Don Simpson/Jerry Bruckheimer blockbusters, a swipe at the bloated action epics of Michael Bay, a comical reflection of jingoistic patriotism from Bush-Era America and a vilification of liberal Hollywood celebrities. And yet, with the exception of the first, TA fails in its supposedly satirical message and delivery of jokes.<br /><br />Many fans have compared Trey Parker and Matt Stone to the iconoclastic comedy troupe Monty Python. I beg to differ. Python were a group of sophisticated intellectuals whose mixture of cerebral humor, political incorrectness and witty dialogue helped produce seething, intelligent and increasingly relevant television episodes and movie satires. Parker and Stone are two practical jokers who think that going after virtually everybody is equivalent to smart satire. No, it does not, especially in a frustratingly haphazard movie like this.<br /><br />And what a frustratingly haphazard movie this is; an audacious idea that falters in uneven execution. The opening sequence, where Team America assault the terrorists and, in turn, annihilate Paris, is extremely funny and perfectly executed, both exciting in its action and mocking of the Bruckheimer productions that Parker and Stone are going after. The sequence where Gary tries to uncover terrorist information in Cairo and is caught in a car chase between the terrorists and Team America is both a loving homage to the Mos Eisley scene from [[ASIN:B0006VIE4C Star Wars]] and an effective jab at the gung-ho American politics of movies like [[ASIN:B0002WZTOI Top Gun]] and the [[ASIN:B0015XHP4A Rambo]] movies.<br /><br />And yet even with these two or three great sequences, the movie doesn't work. Team America is an irritating blend of unfunny jokes (\\"Matt Damon\\", showing loyalties via oral sex, the body part speech in the end), uninteresting puppeteering, mediocre screenwriting (you know this movie's in trouble when it needs to sing about Michael Bay to kill some time) and the longest vomiting scene of all time, which would be funny if it wasn't so tedious. Oh and there's a puppet sex scene. Ha ha ha. Not.<br /><br />This also leads to another problem with TA: the liberal Hollywood celebrities. Why are they in the movie? Why are they portrayed as villains? To be made fun of? That's it? That's not satire; that's grade school mockery. Instead of just mentioning it, why didn't Parker and Stone use Sean Penn's visit to Iraq as a political motivation for aligning themselves with Jong II? That would have given the movie's satirical message a greater edge and the movie more bite. And, sure, there is a subplot where Gary idolizes Alec Baldwin and is shocked to see him revile Team America as the scum of the earth. But it's never fully realized. The actor caricatures seem to exist to be made fun of and that's it. Just because you poke fun at something doesn't mean it is good satire. Yes, it's funny. Ha ha ha. But as satire, it's childish.<br /><br />It's unfortunate that so much talent was wasted on such a feeble movie. Besides Parker and Stone, the movie was photographed by Bill Pope, who did cinematography for [[ASIN:B000ICXQOM Army of Darkness]](1993) and the [[ASIN:B000OPPBEQ Matrix]] movies and the music was composed by Harry Gregson-Williams, who is also the conductor of several Metal Gear Solid video games; to speak little of the puppet operators, who had their talents squandered due to a lackluster script.<br /><br />TA deserves praise for being bold and trying to be creative. It's just too bad that the script couldn't deliver the goods. For a pair of supposedly iconoclastic comedy writers, it's depressing that the best jokes Parker and Stone could come up with involve hammers, oral sex and vomiting. If you want better satires, you're better off checking [[ASIN:B000055Y0X Dr. Strangelove, Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (Special Edition)]] (1964), [[ASIN:B001LMU19G The Exterminating Angel (The Criterion Collection)]] (1962), [[ASIN:B00006RCNV The King of Comedy]] (1983) and [[ASIN:6305922756 This is Spinal Tap (Special Edition)]] (1984). This movie will pass as a nice time-waster but nothing more.<br /><br />Recommendation to avoid.ldn't deliver the goods.

B005LAIGPA|2.0|\\"If we're gonna keep going and we're getting stronger we need rules.\\" After three friends find a strange place the acquire superpowers. At first they just begin to mess around with their new powers and mess with people. When the begin to grow stronger they are forced to decide weather to use them for good or evil. I was actually looking forward to this movie. The preview made it seem a little \\"X-Men\\" like and I though it would be a neat idea. Almost from the beginning I was disappointed. I do however think that this is a movie meant for teenagers and not for me a 33 year old. To me this was a cross between a ton of different movies, most notably \\"Hancock\\" and \\"Superman 3\\", but really almost a blender full of movies. My biggest problem with this one is that it had no plot at all. This is pretty much a reality show about kids with superpowers. If scenes like the kids messing with some lady's car by moving it to another parking spot or eating chips without touching them with their hands is what you are looking for then this is for you. On a side note I think that the fake-documentary genre has run its course and needs to stop. Overall, a plot less movie that I think is geared toward teens, not for me. I give it a C+.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have read over 800 books via Kindle and yes, I have a life. Just prefer reading to TV. Travel, several homes, etc. and always on the go. I am mesmerized by this series. Forget the reviewer who said \\"not alpha\\"---this really is a romance, with deep psychological issues a la Mad Men, flawed characters, and extremely erotic/romantic from a certain point of view. The \\"heroine\\" is believable in an unbelievable way, compassionate to a flaw, and very sexy. Christian, well, he is imaginative and that is being kind, and like the others, flawed. The trust the two inspire to achieve and SPOILER ALERT, eventually do, is amazing. Yes, I am a weeper and on the 3rd volume I did shed tears. Could not put down this book. Highly recommend for those of you who want a bit of knowledge/excitement in your love life (I did learn a few things...). Wonderful distraction if you're caught up in the minutiae of life and need a holiday sans family, friends, etc. Definitely a read you should do alone. Can't wait for the next book by this very talented author.
B000002GC2|4.0|Quincy Jones' The Dude is a smooth jazz/r&b classic featuring the debut of vocalist James Ingram.  Mr. Ingram shines on the album's two big singles, \\"Just Once\\" which peaked at number 17 and \\"One Hundred Ways\\" which topped out at number 14.  Mr. Ingram's vocals on \\"Just Once\\" turn what could be a cheesy, syrupy song into tender, touching ballad.  He also appears on the super funky title track.  Though Mr. Ingram sings the best known songs on the album, it's r&b chanteuse Patti Austin who takes the lion share of the vocals.  She shines brightest on the Stevie Wonder penned \\"Betcha Wouldn't Hurt Me\\" giving a smooth and sultry performance.  The sole instrumental on the album is \\"Velas\\" which features some soft and sweet harmonica work from Toots Thielemans.

B0064MT1U8|4.0|Shakespeare In Love pulled off a major upset at the 1998 Academy Awards when it beat out Saving Private Ryan for Best Picture.  This is probably due to the Miramax machine pumping major dollars behind the film's Oscar campaign, but in watching the film again almost fifteen years later, I think it is has held up better than Ryan.  While there's no denying the brilliance of Stephen Spielberg's directing (the opening D-Day invasion is a visual masterpiece), I found the rest of the movie to somewhat boring.  Shakespeare In Love on the other hand is charming and funny.  Gwyneth Paltrow won a deserved Best Actress Oscar portraying Viola, the daughter of wealthy merchant who loves the theater and desperately wants to act, but cannot as woman are not allowed on the stage.  She poses as a man and wins a part in William Shakespeare's (Joseph Fiennes) new play, Romeo & Juliet.  Mr. Fiennes is great as Will and the supporting cast including a sniveling Geoffrey Rush, a foppish Colin Firth, Tom Wilkerson and an Academy Award winning turn by Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth is first rate.  Even Ben Affleck is great in his brief role as an actor in the troupe.  All in all Shakespeare In Love is worth a first or repeated viewing.

B0079R8IYW|3.0|I recently bought the Kindle Fire, along with a CaseCrown cover ([[ASIN:B005TN0MMO CaseCrown Bold Standby Case (Green) for Amazon Kindle Fire Tablet]] is supposed to be green, but it's more like lime green, but that's a separate item to review!).  That cover uses a strap to hold the case closed, so I wanted to see how this compares.<br /><br />Okay, sure enough, the cover comes with magnets!  It also uses a slip-in method with a left side tuck to secure the Kindle Fire into the cover (compared to the CaseCrown cover, which uses 6 sturdy bracepoints.  The cover does comes with a slot that allows it to be held in the side stand mode.  The synthetic leather really seems like leather to me, even the smell, which surprised me.<br /><br />I had two minor complaints.  One is that it doesn't close perfectly flat.  The magnets do hold it in place, but there's a fold on the front cover, and it seems to be constantly slightly folded to me, especially my wife's iPad cover, which has a more solid feel to the magnetic closure.  The second issue, however, is slightly more of an issue, and it's that you have to tuck the cover into a notch to hold it in the stand position.  Why is this a concern?  Well, 1. You can't do this one handed.  2. It doesn't hold well, and moving it around can dislodge it.<br /><br />Overall, I do like this cover,  If they put a slightly stronger magnet, as well as use a different method to hold the cover together in the stand position, and this could have easily been a 5 star product, especially for its recommended price.<br /><br />UPDATE 04/29/2012:  Now that I've used it more, I have to downgrade this from 4 stars to 3.  The cover makes it hard to tap the edge of the Kindle Fire.  This is especially true for some apps that require hitting the very bottom of the screen to open up the submenu (probably because there are no standard Android buttons on the Fire).  Anyway, this has become too inconvenient for me, so I've switched back to my CaseCrown cover as my main one.

B006VA57CY|5.0|Beautiful costuming and setting, perfect casting, this series has it all. I came by it belatedly, watching both seasons from beginning to end over the course of a week. It has been mentioned that the pre-World War I /turn of the century era lacks much representation: this certainly fills that void and then some. There seems to be a sort of sad fatalism: heading toward aristocratic displacement (the family), the desperation of suitable matches, the law of entailment dictating relative-strangers become heirs, the inevitable involvement of England in the war, and the inevitability of loss of life as many aquaintances join the allied forces. While this could have easily shifted into a sacharin set of love stories or a dry portrayal of heartless upper class entitlement, somehow the stories manage to be poignant and realistic both for upstairs residents and the downstairs residents who spend their lives serving them.I look forward to a third season.

B0018QQQK8|3.0|The Lucky One is a classic Nicolas Sparks novel, enjoyable to read with an unforeseen twist. Not the most romantic book per-say; it encourages the reader to look beyond questionable appearances (motives) to understand how someone's past has determined their future.
0525478817|4.0|The Fault in Our Stars is a beautifully written, imagined, and casted novel. (Casted...is that a word? Eh, who cares.)<br />  The story follows sixteen-year-old \\"Just Hazel\\" Hazel Grace Lancaster, who was only thirteen when she was diagnosed with Stage IV thyroid cancer. But some (imaginary, btw) drug gave Hazel a few more years.<br />  When Hazel's mother declares her \\"depressed\\", she's forced into joining a Cancer Kid Support Group. There, she meets the gorgeous, smart and always funny, Augustus Waters. From this day onward, Hazel's (broken record of a) life is completely changed. For the first time, she has a friend. Someone to talk to about the complexities of life and (my favorite!) books.<br />  Okay, summary over. Seriously, you too lazy to read the synopsis that is literally a scroll away? Jeez.<br />  Hazel is a very lovable, funny character. Despite her illness, she has an optimistic outlook on life that's as refreshing and humorous as it is heartbreaking. Her character is beautifully depicted. She isn't so...perfect (is that the word I'm looking for?), she has actual issues aside from being a loner and boyfriendless. She's as real as they come people.<br />  Same goes for Augustus. He's an amazing character. And, like most of Green's characters, is definitely one you want on your side! He's Hazel's perfect counterpart; they're like matching puzzle pieces.<br />  Oh, and don't you dare let me forget Isaac! He is so funny! His dialogue is some of the most hilarious, like, ever.<br />  Many people, I'm sure, hate the ending. (Or, hey, now that I've said something are reconsidering and going, \\"Thanks, Sierra. I so hate the ending now! You...word that rhymes with itch!) I, being the awesomesause person I so am, loved the ending. It was so bittersweet, you just have to love it! And you want to know why? (Brace yourself. Not a spoiler though. Those suck eggs.) Because \\"real life\\" isn't perfect, and I praise John Green for, not only knowing that, but having the guts to write it.<br />  We all know that, too much in YA books, the characters end up with perfect lives, problems solved--the endings so unrealistic, you wish they'd get hit by a bus for karmic payback and whatnot. The Fault in Our Stars defies that, and wraps up with a perfectly beautiful ending, that makes the whole book mean something.

0449011917|3.0|I came late to the \\"A Song of Fire and Ice\\" series and have listened to them rather than read them.  (So many books, so little time.) I adore Roy Dotrice's narration and marvel at the many accents he masters.  In A FEAST FOR CROWS, though, he slips a bit. Perhaps on ice because winter came a little earlier than expected?  Or perhaps his attention wandered while reading this frequently--Dare I say?--boring entry in the series.  For instance: Mr. Dotrice frequently mispronounces Brienne's name as Briann or Brianna, and Petyr is suddenly pronounced Peter.  He also doesn't use the wonderfully drawling and subtly insulting voice that so perfectly portrays Petyr Baelish.  Now maybe I missed an explanation in the narration for these changes but I don't think so.<br /><br />The biggest slip--and not slight--was the author's.  The third series' entry wasn't quite as exciting as the previous two, and A FEAST FOR CROWS significantly less interesting and exciting.  Maybe it's just the \\"sagging middle\\" curse that afflicts many novelists, whether they write a single novel or a series.  I pray to all the old gods and new that's all it is.  I'm about to begin A DANCE WITH DRAGONS, and have high hopes for it and the sixth entry soon to follow.  And for a rousing, heart-stopping finish in the seventh book where Lord Petyr will, hopefully, get the reward he so richly deserves.
0307591549|1.0|This book is a manifesto for maintaing the status quo.  The thesis is based on the belief that industrial production is a necessary function of human society and that by changing mentalities and habits in order to make the worker \\"happier\\", it (production) can marginally be increased.  This is no different than a pill... Mr. Archor fails to identify the pathology of psychosis.  He assumes that the unfortunate reality of individual unhappiness is inherent - that the negative mentalities, destructive and perverse dispositions are the problems not symptoms.  I wonder if he thinks that if everyone read his book and magically all became \\"happy\\" (despite their truly meaningless labor, spiritual depravity and detached, mediated aberration ironically referred to as life) that a better humanity would prevail. This book is Huxley's idea of soma; its not promoting creativeness, individuality, and actual happiness. It might as well be titled, \\"how to increase robotic functioning\\", or \\"happy sheep make better food\\".  Maybe the reason people aren't happy with their jobs, are depressed, pessimistic etc. is because being a facet of production and having your very existence negotiated and judged by its economic fecundity is fundamentally alienating.  The tone of this book is regurgitated, simplistic, mechanical and short.  I don't care that the author went to harvard however badly he seemingly wants me to;  somehow he apparently didn't learn how to write in his ten years there... reference scientific experiment, personal anecdote, individual application, repeat.  There are lots of really amazing topics presented in this book but mostly glossed over so as to fit in 209 pages.  I understand it's primarily marketed to the advertising executive who's flight is delayed, sitting in the La Guardia barns and noble but don't make it so obvious.  Bright cover, big letters, few pages - I knew happiness would be in there! At least there wasn't a huge picture of the author in his harvard t-shirton the cover. I'd ask for my money back but I'd rather the author use it to buy and read any Erich Fromm work.<br /><br />One last note: what I dislike most about this book is the disservice done to the real sources of the most artistic, inventive, genius revolutionaries of history.  The greatest works of music, art and literature were not born from casual contentment and perfunctory joy; and their creators were not the good little producers that this book espouses for. Degenerate anger, hopeless depression, suffering and sadness awaken the inspiration for revolution and change. I'm not saying that everyone should want to be depressed, but more so just that its o.k. if we are; being dissatisfied with this artificial global culture is natural and trying to be happy about it isn't going to make it or us better.
0741470314|5.0|This book brought tears to my eyes.  It reminded me of how easy it is for a person, especially a kind, gentle and gifted person, who wanted nothing more from the world but to be accepted and treated with dignity, to become villianized and ridiculed because he seemed \\"a little different\\".  Well here's a wake-up call - Michael was different. How could he not be?  He had been in the spotlight, entertainig the world since he was a mere child.  Entertaining was what he knew. But even with that reality, there was something greater about him that was inherently his; the ability to love unconditionally and be compassionate. He was different in that he had been born with many gifts: talent beyond the norm, true compassion and commitment, and a gentle nature, the latter of which caused him to become an easy target. Once the media latched onto him, they never let him go and much of society blindly followed suit.<br /><br />Reading this book will allow the veil to be lifted so that the truth can be seen. For anyone who harbors even an inkling of doubt that what the media told you was a bit one-sided, reading this book will certainly allow you to realize that not only was it a bit off center but a total fabrication; so grossly so that in my eyes, is at least partially to blame for Michael not being with us today.<br /><br />I applaud you, Dr. Moriarity for the courage and insight to write this book and hope that many will read it.  Not just fans of Michael Jackson but fans of humanity who live under the premise that ALL people are created equal and should be afforded the absolute right to live their lives and raise their children with dignity and grace.  ALL people.<br /><br />I am one who have always loved Michael Jackson and always will.  I believe that this book will bring many others over to this side; the side that's \\"all for love\\".

B002PJ8AE2|5.0|My daughters love Barbie everything. We have every Barbie vehicle that's been on the market over the past 3 or 4 years and this one is hands down the best. It is very study and high quality for a Barbie vehicle. The doors open and close and it's very realistic. Very fun to play  with.

B007WAICPQ|5.0|yet another excellent episode. (this one is the best of season 2 so far). this series is among the best of the best out there. easily on par with james bond, alias, 24. superb action spy flick. perfectly entertaining. great acting and action from the amazing cast led by Maggie Q. genius story telling led by Craig S. THANK YOU ALL! keep it up. we need to see way way more than just 2 seasons.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Other than sometimes (depending on version) requiring internet connection and lacking a cross-referencing to reference books, it does everything you could want. There are almost too many versions available to even fully evaluate.
B004EPZ070|5.0|Loved this movie.  Do not understand negative reviews.  Cast was awesome.  Very authentic characters all were excellent and story is very believable.  Looking forward to sequel with original cast.  Locations were great!
B00722ZIBA|5.0|When I first heard this band it was while listening to a jazz station on iTunes. I flew over here to Amazon to buy it, and it's a great group of tunes. If you like jazz, soul and funk this is your album! I've had it for a week and have listened to it every day.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this game is so much fun! it's entertaining and keeps you coming back. the quick energy drain is often very annoying and makes you have to put the game down for a long time before energy is full again but that's not that bad. my big complaint is that it periodically freezes up and some buildings and animals reset to 250 hours or something equally ridiculous. the developer really needs to fix that glitch!!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Great way to pass the time. It is really fun. The graphics are good. Plus it is free. You can't get much better than that.

B007Q476KU|3.0|I am not a fan of Spielburg movies.  I had recently finished a good book on WWI and thought the movie would be fun.  I should have read the plot first.  This movie was too \\"feel good\\" for my tastes.  It also seemed to need to be shortened some.  The ending reminded me of Gone with the Wind. I would skip unless you are a horse person.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This is a good app to read and understand the thing that you are reading and get to know it better.
0345803485|1.0|Though I found this book tolerable I am sickened by what this author has done to the BDSM community. I quote; Anastasia: \\" I have had my eyes opened and glimpsed the extent of his depravity, and i now know he's not capable of love...\\". This author has now labeled the entire BDSM community as depraved?! Speaking as someone who has intimate knowledge of this particular lifestyle, those who practice domination and submission often have a far deeper connection to each other filled with love, respect, and trust that those who are vanilla do not. I am completely offended by this book and how it is portraying D/s practices to the public.
B0020TS5LK|5.0|This is by far THE best vampire film ever made. Any vamp movie that came out after this I would always wish (and still do) Blade would make an appearance so he could shut things down. But, just a dream.
B007UYZDZ6|5.0|When you beging watching this, and you see that Detective Slaughter is actually Adam Baldwin, and he and Castle are going to be teamed up, you know this is going to be a great episode, which it was. Baldwin gets to play a character very similar to Jayne, except more intelligent, and Fillion/Baldwin feed off each other perfectly. It is a hilarious episode to say the least. Outside of that, the episode follows the trademark Castle formula, so no surprises there. The interplay with Castle and everybody else as they exhibit jealousy over Castle teaming up with Slaughter is perfectly awesome and funny. The only thing that was missing was somewhere in the show where Slaughter could have said, \\"You're beginning to damage my calm\\", lol. You're gonna watch it anyway, so i wont spoil the story for you, but this was probably my favorite episode of the season so far.<br /><br />Enjoy!
0345803485|2.0|Saw it as a very successful book, thought it would be a fun read, but god no. I will always read the reviews from now on. I hated it.
055358894X|5.0|This is the most entertaining fantasy I've read this year and probably the best  from a writer new to me that I've read in years.<br /><br />Locke Lamora is a scam artist. An expert con-man. He and his band of _Gentleman Bastards_ prey on the rich in the city of Camorr (clearly styled after Venice). The stakes however soon grow higher and their plots spin out of control when they get tangled up in the schemes of the Grey King.<br /><br />Lynch has a great balance between character, plot and background. The fantasy world feels solid even though very little of it is really detailed and the background we do get springs naturally from the story and while the plot starts slowly it is put to good effect in establishing the closeness of the _family_ that the Gentleman Bastards have formed amongst themselves.<br /><br />Lynch is not sentimental with his characters. They suffer and some of them die. They're also not pure heroes in any way. The nobles, the merchants and the thieves are all guilty of something. The world he creates is dangerous. Magic is deadly as is alchemy in it's own way.<br /><br />I'd call this one a must read and I'm already hunting down the sequel.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|I didn't really know what to expect from this game as I'm not really into the tower defense genre. I was surprised to find that it's quite fun.<br /><br />It starts out easy but by the 9th wave or so it was (at least for me) quite challenging. Early upgrades are easy enough to get, but soon become quite expensive. Fortunately even if you fail a level you still get a small amount of the points you accumulate to spend on the upgrades, so if you are stuck, often a few retries will get you to the point where you can get a helpful upgrade.<br /><br />I mistakenly used a couple of valuable resources too early in the game (charms and a revive) - save those for later when it gets difficult! The revive is really not important early on since the worst that happens if you die is you have to restart the level (I thought I'd have to start from the beginning). Trying to find a working strategy for some of these levels is quite fun.<br /><br />Gameplay is mostly smooth on my Fire - it does lag a bit when action gets heavy but still completely playable. It has exited unexpectedly a couple times but no big trouble.<br /><br />Yes, it's always prompting you to buy glu credits but that's easy enough to ignore. And while that may speed your path to upgrades, there's still lots of fun to be had without buying them (you can get a good number for free in gameplay).<br /><br />I had downrated the game because of some bugs, but glu support helped with my lost glu credits, and the current version works a lot better, so I've been able to finish the game and have restored my original rating.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is an amazing blend between newer social games and the classic Oregon Trail game that I grew up with. I love that there are still multiple choice random events, creatures to shoot at and even diseases that you have to cure pioneers of. However, I do wish it didn't have 'energy' to spend, as it is extremely prohibitive to extended gameplay.

B0000029GA|5.0|One hip hops most prized possesions is masterfully created.clocking in about 40 minutes(yes i know short but sweet) will leave you wanting more but it is what it is..Nas will always be top 5 mc dead or alive despite never living up to this top 10 classic hip hop album of all time, but it was written, stillmatic,the lost tapes, and untitled are classic in there own right, just didn't have the impact or influence like illmatic.Nas street telling stories never bore you throughtout this brilliant listen.dj preimier,pete rock,large professor,q-tip contribute with the beats.This is nas at his most focused, most poetic moment in his career.There are absoloutely no weak tracks just pure boom bap hip hop at it's finest.Favorite tracks include n.y. state of mind,the world is yours,memory lane,represent, one love. Other classic gems from 1994 Are biggie-ready to die,common-resurrection,gang starr-hard to earn,method man-tical,outkast-southernplayalistic,bone thugs-creepin on a come up,pete rock & cl smooth-main ingriedient,jeru the damaja-sun rises in the east.go pick up these right now they will not disapoint.90's hip hop>>>>>>>2000's/2010's rappers and albums
0783240236|5.0|Norman Bates would have felt right at home in that gothic horror of a schoolhouse. And I can't help but think of Edward Gorey's macabre creation, The Gashleycrumb Tinies, whenever I see this movie. Something about mad ravens and terrified children, I suppose...
B000002B1M|5.0|It aches me to hear Nas fans cry and moan over illmatic, shut up already he has other great cd's like this,stillmatic,the lost tapes,untitled and god's son.No Nas is truly wack except for nastradamus  & street's disciple.I Am/Hip hop is day were just ok nothing special.Anyways Nas was only 22 when this dropped and still hungry as you can tell with tracks like the message,i gave you power,take it in blood,the set up,shootouts.Production is a little more polished for commercial appeal but that was the goal in mind for Nas because he was still in the projects after low selling illmatic.He came he saw and conquered the mission objective with it was written going 2x platinum in the U.S & debuting at #1 on the billboard music charts for 4 weeks.The only flaws on this album in my opinion are watch dem Ninjas, Bad produced dr.dre track nas is coming and that's about it.Nas story telling abilities get deeper and complex which may take more then one listen.So go get one of 1996 best hip hop albums.Lyrics=A+ Production=B Subject matter=B+ Entertainment=B+
B007VGXS8M|1.0|I should have paid more attention to the reviews. I was able to open this app on my kindle fire one time. Now the screen won't work, it's<br /> always frozen. My kids are very disappointed.
B005VR9328|5.0|Well being that we are fed and brainwashed by clown,uninspiring,uncreative,corny rap acts like lil wayne,drake,nicki minaj,officer rick ross,young cheesy,soulja boy,roscoe dash,diggy simmons,wale,wiz khalifa etc... You can't help but appreciate this breath of fresh air. All that brag what you have rap gets tiring.But this can be cherished forever.This is some of the roots best work along with illadeph halflife (best album by them period),Things fall apart,How i got over. My only complaint is it's short length and sleep plus the last four insrumental tracks are filler and waste of space. My top tracks are one time, lighthouse, make my, i remember,tip the scale.If you like deep thought provoking storytelling lyrics then pick this up asap.Keep hip hop alive forget that mainstream mtv/bet stuff they show nowadays.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I think the game is very fun..you will enjoy it ...the game will keep you busy cute for kids as well
B0079R8KO0|4.0|I am very pleased with this product overall.  It is very sturdy, and works exactly like it was supposed to.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it came with the wrong instructions.  This case is made so you can stand the kindle up sideways without holding it for ease of viewing, but the instructions were for a different case that folded differently than this one to make the stand.

B006X415GK|4.0|Monster High is a toyline full of gorgeous dolls, and this greyscale version of Frankie is no exception. She comes with a swim-suit, sarong, shoes, jewelry, and stand (no other accessories). Seeing as she's the daughter of Frankenstein's monster and his bride, she has neckbolts and painted stitches on her face and body. Her shoes, earrings, and bracelet are designed to look like bolts; the shoes are exceptionally detailed and creative. Her face is painted nicely, one eye darker than the other to represent her normal green and blue eyes. The greyscale looks terrific on this doll and her box.<br /><br />This doll has articulation in her knees, hips, neck, shoulders, elbows, and wrists; giving her a wonderful range of motion in her arms and the ability to 'hold' small objects. Her hands and arms can be taken off for ease of putting on her clothes; I found this difficult to do on the doll I recieved. I had to pull fairly hard to get one hand off, and it slipped snugly back in.<br /><br />It is fairly easy to slip the doll onto her stand and pose her. She can also stand unassisted if you keep her legs straight.<br /><br />The only issue I had with my doll is her hair. Her gelled bob was haphazarly cut and styled; random chuncks of the hair were too long in the back, and one piece was gelled smushed and tangled in the front. I was able to fix her hair by rinsing it in warm water with conditioner to get the gel out, cutting it and putting in a little smoothing gel to straighten the smooshed hair in front. Now she looks exactly like the box art.<br /><br />I have read on Monster High doll communities that the dolls made in Indonesia have their hair glued in instead of rooted, and this glue seeps out through the doll's hair over time. I will edit this review if this happens with my doll.<br /><br />I have taken off one star for the sorry state my doll's hair came in, but I still recommend her as a nice toy or display piece. (She was $10 after shipping when I ordered her.) Just be prepared to give a little TLC if you are buying online!st be prepared to give a little TLC if you are buying online!

B007Q2N0HA|5.0|I love reading Sylvia Day historicals and contemporaries because I always find them to be realistic and I can connect with the H/h on some level.  However, Bared to You took me to a whole new level of connection.  Both Eva and Gideon (apparently) suffered sexual abuse...but you don't have to have gone through such a trama to relate to them.  When Eva just comes out with her thoughts about jealousy, low self esteem and insecurity, I could totally relate.  Ms. Day, through Eva, gave voice to the insecurities that most of us keep burried for fear of not being accepted or chasing our significant others away. Likewise, Gideon was a hero that I could actually put real life names and faces to of male friends, ex-lovers and my husband...never realizing that they are in love and vulnerable until it hits them like a ton of bricks!  I promise everyone who has been in love will absolutely enjoy reading this book!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app. it is so cool. 101 games is so cool. I can play all the games I want.
B003GFIWGK|5.0|Very nice edition, with all you could ask for.  There are a few errors here and there - it seemed more were towards the end than the beginning.  And of course the stories themselves are fantastic.
1451627289|5.0|This is an excellent novel!  Many people say SK is only a horror writer.<br />I have never believed that was his only voice, and this book proves it!
1451648537|5.0|Isaacson writes a very readable biography.  He paces it well, and provides interesting details without overly focusing on any particular tangent.  Jobs is a fascinating subject -- and he does not come out smelling of roses from this book.  In fact, he comes across quite negatively.  But it is a testament to both Jobs himself and to Isaacson that the book remains compelling from the first to the last page.
B007M7NTPW|4.0|The picture quality was good however I feel the prices should be cut in half for tv episodes. I have also watched a couple other programs and have not had any issues while viewing them. I also feel it would be nice if they could set up a program like netflix for unlimited viewing.

0345803493|5.0|I really became interested in the characters in the first book, and this second novel built upon the first. I was not disappointed in this novel, as it just got better and better. We learn much more about Christen Grey's past and what makes him tick, and still see it all through Ana's eyes. Mysteries and suspense unfolds, as does the couple's desire for each other. It truly keeps you interested in what's happening, and has a much better developed plot than the first novel. I for one, am going straight into the third novel.
B0055SWM08|5.0|awesome game relaxing but still challenging. cant seem to put it down. could easily spend an afternoon on this one

B000JQU1VS|5.0|This is the collection immediately following Holmes' return after Moriarty dragged him to his death over those falls in \\"The Final Problem\\".  At the beginning of the first story, Holmes returns and explains his miraculous escape to Watson, and of course begs his forgiveness!  Then it's back to the plot.  With tales such as the Dancing Men, the Six Napoleons, and the Golden Pince-Nez, this is Doyle at his typical best.  Well worth a read, if only to discover who really done it!
B006M7JCC2|4.0|Believing that this book is true, it is quite a remarkable eye opener.  I think I have a problem that there was not too much of a mention of meeting someone greater than ourselves in the NDE.  The Greater One being God, but this NDE expresses that there is God in all of us, which I believe is true. I also have a problem that some old friends weren't as important as maybe they couldn't quite fit the new person the author had become, for maybe they needed her most.  Those that know or think they know, I don't think should be the ones that are the new friends, for they already get it, don't they?  But truly a good read, well written and like I mentioned truly makes you want to take a better look at ourselves.

However, after I downloaded and opened it, I was told I needed to download 80 MB of programming in order to run this game on my Kindle Fire.

Published in 2001, and read by nearly everyone since, I came upon the book in a used bookstore. I loved the smell of used books, the feel of them--they're always better if they have signs of history: writings in the margins, wears and tears, here and there. This one was in good shape, meaning the reader before me had not left any discernible markings.<br /><br />I picked out the book because I needed something and wasn't quite sure where to look. All I could remember was someone telling me once upon a time that it was about a person alone in a boat with a tiger. Honestly, I thought that it was one of those clever post-modern books. Something I would try to write when I was 23 and considered myself an \\"artist.\\"<br /><br />But no, the book is about a person on a boat stranded in the Pacific, and despite the absurdity, the person is caught with a tiger. And despite the odds, the book is all about the physicality and realism of the situation.<br /><br />The book is brutal, physical, detailed look at the will to survive. And yet because the protagonist is deep and spiritual, his journey to survive is also deep and spiritual. The author demonstrates the infiniteness of the natural world and the wonder of existence in the minute details of Pi Patel's tale of survival. In the effort to survive, every detail of the book takes on new significance.<br /><br />The form of the book also says quite a lot about the state of modern best sellers. I'm told from the outset that quite a lot of important newspapers and magazines liked the book. How on earth did the Economist come to review the book? That's my question. It's a magazine about economics and politics for cripes sake.<br /><br />I couldn't imagine a better traveling book. I wasn't traveling when I read the book, but the book itself has motivated me to do more traveling. It also makes you treasure life, family, God, the food in front of you, and to behold the wonder of the natural world around you.<br /><br />Which parts did I like the best? Without giving too much away, the beginning--Yann Martel's story of the origin of the book, the moments that they character has alone with the tiger of course, the excitement of the island, and the ambiguous ending.<br /><br />I'll admit it. I'm not smart enough to know what the ending means. \\"And so it is with God\\" remains a cryptic line in my mind. I will leave it to you to explain it to me.<br /><br />I think that reading group guides at the end of books are hilarious--they are meant to appeal to those readers out there who are not cynical about group reading (never tried a book club--but will one day). And yet, despite my cynicism I am baffled by the simple complexity of the questions.<br /><br />Is Life of Pi a tragedy, romance, or comedy? It has aspects of all of them for sure--but it has a happy ending without ever having to be a romance or a comedy. A spiritual triumph-book! It cannot be called a comedy. Even the most absurd parts of the book happen in utmost seriousness. What laughs we receive only relieve us from the horror of the protagonist's tale. Romance--between a boy and a tiger? Sort of. Pi really did love his tiger friend, didn't he? And the protagonist appears like a jealous lover at the end (hopefully, that didn't give away too much).<br /><br />Aw, life is nothing but hellos and goodbyes. So until next time, I say to you, whoever may read this: good journey.God, the food in front of you, and to behold the wonder of the natural world around you.<br /><br />Which parts did I like the best?

0307477479|5.0|I urge you to read this book! I recommend it all the time - to students, other writers, a near-stranger in a bar at the Waldorf Astoria last week. There are several good reasons why I shouldn't have liked the book, i.e. I'm bored with the music business and I loathe PowerPoint presentations, but this book adds up to far more than the sum of its parts. Ms. Egan seems incapable of writing a bad sentence. This is a deeply compassionate, beautiful \\"novel\\" -- not to be missed.
B005LAIH3G|4.0|First of all if you heard the critics you heard the idiots who like it when a show is rebooted for the 3 and 4th time. This show is outside of normal film making and presents a cool contrast to the normal run of the mill movie shows these days. Actors did a great job. Will definately by the BD DVD when it comes out.

This one is no exception.<br /><br />Get one - get them all.  Leave them out for your teens to read.

It really stoked up a firestorm about Asian parenting.  I hear another interesting read is [[ASIN:1594203334 Bringing Up Bebe: One American Mother Discovers the Wisdom of French Parenting]], although I haven't had a chance to read it yet.  I recommend Battle Hymn to anyone who wants to appreciate their parents.  Reading this will make you thankful your parents weren't so bad!

B0074V3712|4.0|Wilson soon identifies the creation myth as \\"the Darwinian device for survival,\\" and in doing so he's actually taking a giant step in the right direction. However, he doesn't recognize the similarity of all creation myths. Instead he adopts Walter Burkert's explanations of sacrifice as emerging from \\"the hunt,\\" as though we're the only creatures that hunt, or the only creatures that hunt socially. But virtually all creation myths have a hero at the nexus who is sacrificed in order that \\"the world\\" can come into being. They may describe this world differently, but that's always related to local conditions. What's important is that in myths there is seldom a direct reference to the violence associated with this sacrifice. It survives only in myth's co-traveler: ritual. But why is it that Wilson seems blind to this unifying theme behind all myth? Could it be that he, as we, simply resist the notion that human culture is always and only founded on murder? This would, no doubt, be a bad reflection on *us* as a species immersed in a universe with no teleological principle, since we not only haven't transcended the founding murder, but fail to even recognize it when the evidence is everywhere.<br /><br />But how else than a peculiar universal amnesia could we, together, \\"arrive at the place where we began, and recognize it for the first time?\\"

B003Y5H5HY|5.0|First let me safely say this is a fantastic film. I saw the 2009 version and loved it. This 2011 version, though different, is just as excellent and is actually in many ways more faithful to the book. It is written, acted and directed brilliantly.<br /><br />Here is my beef:<br />The movie looks horrible. It was shot on a high tech digital camcorder, a Red 4k using Zeiss lenses. You would think this would mean something, and it does, a washed out lifeless, colorless, contrastless blah. This made the movie so hard to watch. This is such a well made film, whoops, I mean \\"video\\" that it is such a waste that it was shot on this immature medium. If this video had been shot on \\"real film\\" it would have been wonderful and rich with every scene complimenting in luxurious richness the power of the performances. But this was not to be.<br /><br />I have seen the Red digi cams on other movies and the same problems abound. However I have seen movies and programs shot with the Arri digital cameras and they are astoundingly rich and lovely. So what is wrong with the Reds and why do they suck? It is just such a shame that directors are jumping on the digital bandwagon before the medium has solved all its dynamic range issues. As a result be prepared to see a lot of great movies that are really ugly.
0345803485|1.0|I give this book a 4 out of 10 at best. The concept is so far fetched (Yes, I realize I am reading a fiction book) but its not even remotely believeable. You have a 21 year old character, who is inexperienced sexually and has no personality who meets a \\"perfect\\" man. This perfect man \\"falls\\" for her but at the same time gets off by hurting her, literally. It was not my favorite book. It seemed repetitive. I just don't recommend it personally.

I think that's a bit much for a weather app...However, as for the actual app itself, it's very accurate and is pretty much the same thing you see on the Weather Channel wrapped up in an app. The only reason I deleted this app is because of its permissions.

0930073193|4.0|Economics in One Lesson might be Hazlitt's most famous work, largely thanks to its readability and enduring relevance.<br /><br />The book is divided into thirty-five short chapters, about four and a half pages each.  The first and last chapters state and re-state, respectively, the \\"lesson\\" for which the book is named: that when making economic decisions, we must \\"consider what their effect would be in the long run on all groups,\\" rather than focusing only on particular groups, at a particular time.  The point is to think through the full, long-term implications of any particular policy, for all groups, everywhere, particularly the \\"invisible\\" implications.<br /><br />Hazlitt's writing style is perfectly readable for the non-economist, and some of his linguistic innovations are downright brilliant.  I will be using \\"multiple economic personality disorder,\\" for example, and \\"wageer,\\" much more often.  The parable of the broken window is also quite useful, and even more beautiful returning to it a second time, after having finished the book.<br /><br />The Lesson is also enduringly relevant.  It was first published in 1946, and last revised in 1978, but many passages seem like they could have been plucked from this morning's Wall Street Journal.  Chapters like \\"Saving the X Industry,\\" \\"The Drive for Exports,\\" \\"How the Price System Works,\\" \\"Minimum Wage Laws,\\" \\"The Function of Profits,\\" and \\"The Assault on Saving,\\" among others, seem eerily contemporary.<br /><br />Hazlitt must have felt the same d&eacute;j&agrave; vu when he last revised this book.  He observes in the final chapter of this edition (published in 1979) that virtually none of the lessons from the first edition (published in 1946) had been absorbed by policymakers in the intervening decades.  That policymakers seem to have absorbed so little (even as some have over-absorbed some of it, e.g. on taxes) since 1979 makes me all the more suspicious that The Lesson will continue to relevant decades from now.<br /><br />Still, other discussions are dated, and some seem backwards.  For example, while the logic underlying Hazlitt's concerns about tariffs, rent controls, the \\"fetish\\" of full employment, the danger of inflation, and so on still seems largely correct, today these issues are at best relatively unimportant, and at worst the opposite of what most need attention right now.  Tariffs have fallen dramatically since World War II, for example, rent is if anything too high, hardly anybody is actually opposed to labor-saving technological advances any more, inflation is almost certainly less important than an economy in its third straight year of 8%+ unemployment, and so on.<br /><br />More fundamentally, Hazlitt's arguments are almost entirely unempirical.  He seems content throughout The Lesson to base his opinions merely on logic, common sense, and a few assumptions, rather than the sort of careful empirical work that have since added considerable nuance to economist' understanding of minimum wage laws, the role savings, inflation rates, etc.<br /><br />Also, in a few places The Lesson's readability comes at the expense of accuracy.  Too often Hazlitt uses a term like \\"only,\\" \\"virtually all,\\" or some other superlative, where the truth is really much more subtle and nuanced.  His fear of inflation and praise for savings, for example, seem limitless, in contrast to his more balanced approach to unions.<br /><br />In Hazlitt's defense, he probably over-stated some of his points for effect (Paul Krugman does the same thing), especially towards the end of the book.  I suspect his true opinions were far more skeptical and nuanced than his most hyperbolic sentences make it seem.<br /><br />All things considered, I strongly recommend Economics in One Lesson.  Virtually every chapter is at least somewhat relevant today, if not highly so, an impressive feat for a book last revised 34 years ago.  And I suspect that \\"multiple economic personality disorder\\" will eventually make even the least relevant chapters important once again.<br /><br />Hazlitt's opinions deserve to be questioned, criticized, and perhaps even been refuted, but \\"the lesson, and the underlying logic on which it is based, deserves to be taken quite seriously.<br /><br />I suggest reading the first and last chapters, then taking a look at the table of contents, and reading whatever piques your interest.relevant chapters important once again.<br /><br />Hazlitt's opinions deserve to be questioned, criticized, and perhaps even been refuted, but \\"the lesson, and the underlying logic on which it is based, deserves to be taken quite seriously.<br /><br />I suggest reading the first and last chapters, then taking a look at the table of contents, and reading whatever piques your interest.

0545265355|5.0|I bought this book set for my teenage daughter and husband to read, after they saw the movie.  My daughter had already read the first book, Hunger Games.  I decided to pick it up too one day.  I loved the imaginative story and the writing is fabulous.  I couldn't put it down.  I quickly caught up to my husband and had to share the last book.  Two bookmarks where in it, which worked fine for a couple of days...until I had to leave for a business trip.  My husband got custody of the book and I can't wait to get back home to finish it up.  My daughter read the third book in a single day because she just could not put it down.  If you like science fantasy or fantasy books, you will love this one!

1615243496|4.0|Nice edition of Frankenstein for your collection. It is a good quality leatherette that feels nice, but it is not leather.  The leatherette is very thin and will wear off the corners and binding.  The paper is medium weight.  The font is large size.  The binding is not very strong. The cloth ribbon is the extra narrow. It might actually be considered a wide thread rather than a ribbon. It is much narrower than the one pictured. The book is comparable in quality to the Barnes and Noble leather series...but with much bigger font.

0345803485|1.0|I cannot believe the crazy hype around this book. I would give it zero stars if it were possible. The narrator is annoying as can be, going on and on about her stupid inner goddess. The dialogue is totally unbelievable (the term \\"laters\\" is supposed to be romantic?). About a fourth of the book is made up of stupid emails, including subjects, date fields and signatures. There is no plot at all. I think she graduated from college, went to Christian's house a few times, went home to visit her mom, and had dinner with Christian's family. Honestly, there is no action at all, except for the completely over the top sex scenes. This book makes Twilight look like great literature.
B001EUK35C|4.0|I really enjoyed the film 'Koyaanisqatsi' which is the first in the trilogy. The music was fascinating and I became a fan of Philip Glass. 'Powaqqatsi' was a nice mix of world music-inspired score with Glass' typical style. While not my favorite stand-alone album, it has some beautiful tracks. I really like the 'Anthem' theme, as well as 'The Unutterable.'
1439127700|5.0|I've only read through page 77, so I will add to this review in a few days.<br /><br />My short take is that it projects more depth, broader vision, greater detail, clearer prose and more interesting insights than Profiles in Courage.<br /><br />The unpublicized relationship between Hoover and Truman, both concerned about avoiding wide-spread starvation in Europe in the wake of WWII reflects a non-partisan and unbiased relationship that simply isn't around any more. At the time, it was the biggest issue on the table.<br /><br />I have no greater ambition today than expressed by Hoover to Truman about efforts to reorganize the Executive Branch in the post-war era: \\"Our job is to make every Government activity that now exists work efficiently.\\" My vote in the upcoming election will be driven by this shared hope, not the usual drivel one expects from campaigners. Hoover disappeared during the FDR era, allegedly as the main cause of the Depression and certainly its symbol for many, but Truman reinstated him. A profile in courage, indeed.<br /><br />The second chapter reflects Truman's adoration of Eisenhower, in uniform and out...until Ike declared himself a Republican to keep isolationists (Taft) out of the White House. This is another theme we're about to revisit in the looming foreign policy debate.<br /><br />The theme of this book is that former Presidents stick together to protect The Office. I still think the title should be The Presidents' Club, with the apostrophe.<br /><br />(May 2, 2012) I've now finished the book and don't have a lot to add except on a philosophical level. The U.S. presidency isn't really duplicated anywhere that comes to mind, but the elevation is short-termed, no more than 8 years. After that we see a more human side of their character that doesn't differ from many others we either know personally or read about. The book does not answer (nor purport to) why anyone would seek the office. Yes, I suppose the reasons are complex but ambition--and occasionally accident--tops the list. It is naive to think any candidate simply wants to help make the world a better place. This book suggests that presidents after they leave office are pretty much like anyone else who once occupied a seat of great power. In the end, they're human after all.<br /><br />Brent Scowcroft's name keeps popping up. Makes me wonder if he ever dispensed bad advice?
B005J29HCQ|4.0|You can't argue with the genius of the tunes on \\"Smile\\". As a \\"regular\\" album, this does indeed qualify as a classic. But I'm taking a star away on this 2-CD version for the second disc, which is comprised of very questionable \\"alternate\\" versions, outtakes, and VERY annoying studio chatter. Maybe the completists have wet dreams about these sort of bonus tracks, but I find it very annoying to listen to. Once was enough for me. But the first disc here is the gem, and that's the one that I find myself enjoying very much. Disc 2? That's going to be gathering dust in my house.
B002VJ0576|3.0|Is it horrible?  Oh yes, but that's what makes it so much fun to watch.  I found myself in stitches at some of the scenes like Watson trying to come up with a way to explain that they were chased by a dinosaur.  So many times I found myself saying \\"Oh come ON!  You can not be seriously doing this!\\"<br /><br />I must buy this so I can watch the bad movie Gareth David Lloyd did back to back with Shark Attack 3 - Megladon, which was the really bad movie John Barrowman did.<br /><br />Have fun with the awfulness, people, and wonder what bet Gareth lost to agree to be in this film.

0345803485|5.0|I thought that I would read the first few chapters just before going to bed. Boy, was that a mistake. I've pretty much blown off of everything that I've had to do for the last 18 hours in order to read this book, and I was not disappointed. I didn't think that I would be able to appreciate the BSDM, but I thought it was a great addition to the story. The thing to keep in mind is that this is based off a fanfiction that is based off of Twilight, so your expectations can't be that high. The first half of the novel is definitely the sexiest part.<br /><br />Also, take your time with this. The longer you can stretch out the reading experience, the longer you can stretch out your, umm, \\"experience.\\" :D
B003JTHFTS|1.0|The premise of the book was just too ridiculous.  Maybe I didn't give it enough time (34 pages) but a 17 year old with a stammer and a 35 year old rake?  It was just preposterous.  Also, I found reading the text with the stammer was very annoying.  I gave up at about page 35 because the plot was not convincing!

B005OCFHHK|4.0|This DVDs were a pretty good deal. They were relatively cheap and for the most part work well. Unfortunately, my copies would get stuck on certain scenes momentarily on occasion. Thankfully, this never resulted in a crash, but it was mildly annoying. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants Harry Potter movies cheap and does not demand perfect quality.

B006ZZC3D6|4.0|Thought this might last a day or two on my phone, but I LOVE this game. Sure, it gives you what seems to be impossible puzzles to solve, but the nice graphics and for some reason, I really like the music.<br /><br />The only reason I can't give it 5 Stars is the fact that if you skip a puzzle, you get penalized with extra puzzles, which is ok I guess, but my biggest complaint is one you use your 2 or 3 hints, they're gone until the next level. Should have a system like Quell.

B000LJ9ZWO|2.0|Well shot, this 70's sci-fi is okay for what it is, and entertains for what it is, but like all films trying to portray what the future might be like, it has a hard time staying ahead of the curve when viewed by a 21st century audience.<br /><br />Robots and programming thereof work a little differently than portrayed in the film.  The film presents a kind of Cape Kennedy control center for the audience, as we see a massive effort to entertain which, by 1960's and 70's logic, could only be done with a massive number of scientists and engineers controlling the whole thing.  Reality is a little more prosaic, and the techno-references give a smirk here and there as the exposition of the story unfolds.<br /><br />But, the story itself is about technology gone wrong, and is a parable about the dangers of creating something that can think for itself without experiencing that which makes living organisms what they are.<br /><br />I hadn't seen the entire film until recently, and, based on what I saw, I can't say I'm glad I didn't see it, nor am I put out by anything in the film.  It's a sci-fi western with few SFX shots that presents a possible world to adults of the 1970s.  In essence you're seeing a real world Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game that takes a few missteps.<br /><br />Not a bad watch, and innovative at select points, but it is a product of its era.
B001NPJGL0|5.0|I was very skeptical about the pocket-size digital level before ordering.  Now that I have it, though, I couldn't do without it.  I'm a real estate consultant & often need to check slopes, etc. This level fits perfectly in my bag since it doesn't take up much room & works like a charm.  The only potential drawback is that since it's so small, you have to get fairly close to read the digital measure.  I'm buying a few more of these for my clients.
B002L4QP0M|5.0|Jeffrey Archer has been one of the world's best storytellers for over 25 years. This is one of his early stories and a good one. A Matter of Honour is an espionage thriller in the days of the Cold War. Archer weaves a complex and exciting plot which leaves you breathless until nearly the last page.<br /><br />As well as being a best selling author, Archer lived an successful life as a UK Cabinet minister and life peer until this was ended by his conviction and subsequent imprisonment for perjury. Despite all of these traumas his story telling skills have not diminished over the years.<br /><br />His latest book - Sins of the Father in the Clifton Chronicles series (this book contains a sample of the first chapter) - still has his magic touch. While his latest book was released outside the US in mid March it will surprisingly not be released in the US until May 8. It is worth waiting for but the ending will keep you in suspense again until he has written the next book in the series.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|Good Book, love the twists and turns.  Rook is so likeable and Heat, just great.  Would definitely recommend reading.  It's fun and a really quick read because you just don't want to put it down.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|really good, just didn't read all of the reviews first. at first I was confused because the arrow wasn't at the bottom of the screen. but all I had to do was 'install' a game. in the upper right corner of the screen, there is a button. press the button, press install, and you will go to the appstore and go home.
B005LAIH9A|5.0|OK, we all saw AP7, and it sucked.  Granted.  Glad to see they didn't leave the whole series on that note.<br /><br />This movie is possibly the best of all, provided you've watched the original trilogy so you're aware of all the plot lines.  Everything gets both revealed and tied together expertly in this movie.  The main characters end up with who they're supposed to, storylines get closed, and there's plenty of raunchy fun along the way, including the familiar plot of stupidity getting people into trouble and love getting them out.<br /><br />The only way they could continue now would be to continue the story line of Erik from 6.  AP9 could conceivably feature Erik rising to take Dwight's place in the Beta house.  There is no continuation of 7, none of us want to see Nathan or Lube or Rob again.<br /><br />If they tried to come out with another film with the original cast, it would be pointless.  This movie just wraps it all up perfectly.  If you were a fan of the original trilogy, this is a must-see.
B000N5F6OW|1.0|I recently ordered Hatari with John Wayne from Amazon....arrived in good order, but when try to view the movie it played OK for ~1.5 hour then had so much drop outs and sound disturbances that it couldn't be watched for long.  Is there a way to get a replacement CD sent or my money back?
0316010669|3.0|I loved the first few chapters of the book.The story of the artists' judgement over the piece in the museum in a few seconds as against the thorough analysis of the scientists' and lawyers' was a great example of how sometimes decisions based on intuition are more accurate.I love the way Gladwell describes the storytelling problem of people wherein we try and justify things not because they have a justification but because a story makes it more believable. The examples of subjects exhibiting a racial attitude even when they thought otherwise and the explanation of racial attitude coming in two levels: conscious and unconscious was very provoking as well. Another wonderful theory was that of music auditions becoming fairer when a screen was brought in between the panel and the participant. Shutting off too much information by removing one of the senses really does make the other sense better. However, there were some examples in the latter half that seemed somewhat less convincing to me such as the war commander, the Pepsi challenge and the Warren Harding Error. When I read 'The Power of thinking without thinking' on the cover, I was hoping to read about some great instances of this power that throw more light into the art and make the reader more equipped with the decision making process.I was a little disappointed here. The booked lacked a conclusive and convincing end but it was still an enjoyable read with all its research and stories.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|AMAZING - I have read both books 1 and 2 and I am ready for more. The ONLY down side is this... what will I do when I finish book 3??

1596432594|5.0|The first thing you see on the cover is a quote from Feynman's mother Lucille after Omni named him the world's smartest man. \\"If that's the worlds smartest man, god help us.\\"  This graphic novel does a good job of hitting the main parts of Feynman's life.  The authors also take on the challenge of explaining Feynman's very mathematical insights in graphic form.<br /><br />In particular they develop his explanation of how electrons and light interact. This doesn't explain gravity or radioactivity, but it does explain most observable phenomena, all the interactions taking place outside atoms. Our understanding increases and we get extremely good agreement between this QED, Quantum Electrodynamics theory, and experiment. No experiment contradicts it. So it works.  It is very strange, but that makes it intriguing and interesting, even if we don't understand it.  This is the way nature works the predictions agree with experiment, but we don't understand why it works.<br /><br />Light sometimes acts like a wave, other times a particle- a photon, both are found by experiment.  Feynman prefers to use photons. For example take photons passing through a window, and some photons are reflected back.  If you visualize a single pane of glass with photons striking the front surface about 4% of the photons reflect off this surface, the rest of the photons continue thru the glass and hit the back side of the glass and another 4% of the photons are reflected and the rest continue outside of the glass. For a single color of light (from a laser) all the photons are exactly the same-why do a small number reflect?  The 4% is quite predictable, but for individual photons not predictable at all.  Feynman doesn't understand why, doesn't like it, but is fascinated by it. This is where the combination of the artist's graphics with the attached bubble text makes it clearer as an explanation.<br /><br />Another example is a soap bubble or oil on a water surface that show color.  but different parts show different colors. It depends on the thickness of the surface of the soap bubble and when the light reflects off the front surface and the back surface the light that reflects off the back surface has to travel a little bit further to get to your eye.  Different colors of light will interact differently.  If the conditions are right the photons add together and you see that color (constructive interference). If they subtract then that color disappears (destructive interference) and that color disappears.  You see the resultant of the colors that remain.<br /><br />Feynman goes deeper by using vectors to represent each reflection from the front and back surface. He uses a graph with time in the vertical direction and distance travelled in the horizontal direction, and connects the vectors head to tail. This can be done for each possible reflection and each is connected to the last head to tail. The angle and length of each vector contains information, connecting the vectors head to tail keeping their angle the same (most important), and using a final vector to connect the beginning tail to the final head gives the final vector whose length can be considered one side of a square.  The area of the square is just this vector length (the length of a side of the square) times itself, and is the probability of seeing the light beam taking this path.  Adding up all the arrows gives the probability for the beam of light, and it works for electrons, as well as photons.  Light takes the path that requires the least amount of time.  Light is transmitted through glass by photons being absorbed by electrons and reemitted in the same direction. Light is reflected when the photons are absorbed and reemitted in a different direction.  This absorption of a photon and reemission takes time and is why photons seem to travel more slowly through a media such as glass or air.  The velocity of the photon is the same when moving through water, but the interactions with electrons take time so the photons appear to be moving slower because it takes longer to move through the water.<br /><br />If you draw an electron going back in time it describes a positron or antielectron, this is the particle used in PET scans.  Interesting!<br /><br />The examples are much easier to understand when a talented artist has clear graphs accompanying the explanation.  The authors include a very interesting bibliography for continued reading with links to where you can see videos with Feynman talking about a variety of topics.
1401223176|5.0|Can I just say, I am obsessed with Jim Lee's artwork in this??  This is the pinnacle of what I imagine the characters of Batman to look like, sound like, and act.  This was recommended to me by a local comic-book store employee - I bought it on the spot.  I'm relatively new to reading comics, and I told him I enjoyed Batman: The Animated Series.  He immediately recommended I read \\"Hush\\".  And boy, am I glad I did! :)  I've passed this along to my girl-friends, and they loooove it too.  There are strong female characters in this book, and honestly I love how Catwoman is portrayed in this.  She's beautiful, mysterious, and \\"sexy\\" - all done without looking too much like a pin-up girl - it's so awesome how she's drawn and depicted here.  The storyline doesn't fall flat either.  It's very similar to the Long Halloween, only instead of being filled with mobsters, now the \\"freaks\\" have taken the center stage.  He follows the continuity to a tea, and it's fantastic.  I really hope Loeb and Lee do some more stuff together in the future.  I'll be lined up waiting to get it! :)

0060512806|4.0|This is a really good book which gets into facts you do not normally see, however the book is really large and will take a good portion of time to get through. Also has shifting narrator perspective between three characters, two during World War II and one in the present.
B0037YOMWS|3.0|THE AWESOME: Unbounded Potential<br /><br />This *business* calculator can be re-purposed into the most-powerful *scientific* calculator in the history of scientific calculators (excepting graphing calculators, which are more powerful in some respects but also are heftier and tend to emphasize graphing and algebra functions over pure number crunching).<br /><br />The re-purposing is done by re-flashing (re-programming) the device. Web links cannot be included in Amazon reviews. However, the re-purposed calculator goes by the name of WP-34s (after the initials of the authors of the replacement software: Walter B & Paul Dale). Sourceforge hosts the project WP-34s, so check the info out there.<br /><br />The WP-34s improves upon the HP-41C/HP-42S and the newer HP-33s/HP-35s. It's rather ironic that a *financial* calculator sold by HP can be reprogrammed into a far more powerful *scientific* calculator than HP's own HP-35s, using software written entirely by enthusiasts not affiliated with HP.<br /><br />THE BAD: Criminal Non-Support and Mixed Quality<br /><br />I just had a very strange (and unpleasant) experience with HP \\"product support\\".<br /><br />I bought my first (brand new in sealed package) HP-30b in May 2011. The keyboard's quality was pretty poor, with quite a few keys that did not click at all... they felt very \\"flat\\" (all keys are supposed to click, by the way). Other than the keyboard issue, the calculator was perfectly functional during the few weeks I used it.<br /><br />Moreover, after a few months without being touched, the HP-30b died a spontaneous death. (This calculator was never repurposed as I indicated above, precisely because I did not like the feel of the keyboard. Last month 3/2012 I bought a second 30b whose keyboard is much better---product quality is a mixed bag!)<br /><br />I assumed the dead calculator was under warranty, so I called HP support. (It is April 2012 as of this writing, hence less than 1 year after my original purchase.)<br /><br />I was told that since the seller was not an \\"HP Authorized Reseller\\" (it was a Third Party seller in Amazon), and since the calculator had been manufactured in 2010, it was long out of warranty!!! I got some preaching on the demerits of \\"buying from non-authorized HP resellers\\" and I had to try really hard to avoid yelling expletives on the phone. I told the representative that I was obviously an idiot for not buying directly from HP at full retail price, meaning twice what I paid, and then I hung up.<br /><br />I want to emphasize that I received the calculator new-in-the-box with HP's \\"Security Seal\\" intact back in May 2011. Nobody can \\"fake\\" these calculators nor their HP-seal bearing boxes. The product I bought was legit. The only illegitimate thing going on is HP selling old-stock calculators through non-authorized resellers fully knowing they will not have to make good on their warranty in case of failure, as it happened to me. I own several of HP's current calculator models, including 12c, 33s and 35s. I have had good luck with their quality, so perhaps the defective 30b is a fluke, but that is no excuse for reneging on the warranty. Criminal HP!<br /><br />I had no idea that new-in-the-box electronics (with a dated receipt) could be sold without warranty, at least not without some *very clear* warning to that effect.<br /><br />I will try to seek a remedy from Amazon, and shall update this review accordingly.<br /><br />UPDATE: Amazon issued a full refund (as store credit) for the defunct calculator. I also got \\"free education\\" on so-called \\"grey market\\" purchases. One cannot take things for granted as a consumer, even if shopping at reputable (?) merchants (Amazon). In this regard, I am quite disappointed with the experience.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I bought 3 books in one. It would have been nice to have the title of each book at the top while I was reading, or to have them appear as separate books instead of just one book.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|After all the hype on a TV morning show regarding this trilogy I decided to try the first book.  Naively I was hooked on this \\"romance\\" novel by the first few chapters and then I hit THE CHAPTER that introduces the playroom in all its glory.  I almost quit reading, after all, I've never read any BDSM novels and I was completely turned off and a little pissed that the key character, Ana, was coming across as weak.  My advice to new readers... DON'T QUIT READING THE BOOKS.  It all makes so much more sense the more you read on.  I read the first two books in a week and am thrilled to start reading the third knowing where Christian & Ana's relationship has been and where it's at at the end of Book 2.  I've heard that someone bought the movie rights to the trilogy.  I can't imagine how they will tame this down for even an R rating but I can't wait to see how they will portray it either.  P.S. If your spouse notices a change in you in the bedroom, just tell him/her to thank E.L. James in the morning. ;)

0345803485|4.0|I really enjoyed the story.  The main characters are eerily similar to those in the Twilight series, but there is a reason that series was so successful, right?  There is a lot of repetitiveness in the way the author has written this book.  I feel she could have done a better job in that regards. For example, it seems every kiss was exactly the same.  Christine grabs her hair and pulls it to tilt her head and kiss her.  After a dozen of this same kiss, it becomes boring.  Having said that, I think the story behind the writing is good and is why I will be finishing up the series.

B00757J98K|3.0|my interest in madonna has been sporadic. back when i was a teenager (wayyyy back in the 80's) i was pretty focused on heavy metal, and kind of scoffed at madonna as pop radio nonsense. as the years went by i matured out of that silly point of view, and came to appreciate all kinds of music, and i had to admit that madonna had some pretty awesome music that stands the test of time. i still didn't pay all that much attention to her career though, other than knowing all the popular songs that anyone who doesn't live under a rock has to know, and nodding and thinking, 'yep, it's good, ok.' then a couple of years ago, i picked up 'ray of light', and i was blown away. it is easily and by far my favorite madonna album. i appreciate her earlier music for being simple but infectious, but i personally like the more intense moods and sounds that have come from her more recent works. confessions on a dancefloor at first almost seemed to depressing and dark, but somehow i found myslef coming back to the cd over and over and it really grew on me. i also like 'music'... i never got a chance to check out 'hard candy'.<br /><br />which brings me to the new cd, mdna. i do like the cd. in a way it seems like she's trying to get back to simple pop songs, but i don't know... although her earlier music was simple and catchy, it had a kind of magic that is missing from these songs. don't get me wrong, i LIKE a lot of this cd, like the opening 'girls gone wild' which although isn't anything groundbreaking, has a good groove, nice vocals, and is a solid song. \\"i'm addicted\\" has some cool techno pop sounds and effects. i like 'i'm a sinner' because it sounds like something beck would write... and i love beck. \\"masterpiece\\" is a pretty song. i also like parts of \\"i don't give a\\"... but that song also has some of what i don't like about the new cd. i don't like that she seems to be relying on people like nicki minaj (who personally i don't care for, and it annoys me to hear her on this cd), to give her music credibility to appeal to a younger audience. it feels forced and in my opinion doesn't fit her. i DO happen to like lil wayne, but i don't care for how she seems to be channeling him in 'gang bang' when she starts yelling 'drive bitch! die bitch!'. i'm not offended by violence or anything like that, but it just sounds silly coming from her. it just doesn't fit. so there ARE things i really like, and things i don't like about the cd, but what's actually worse, in my opinion, is that there is a lot of kind of boring and forgettable material.<br /><br />by the way i've seen some people criticizing the lyrics. come on people, this is madonna, not shakespear. i think it's silly to look for something profound in pop-music lyrics. they should sound good, go with the music, and maye even be catchy and funny. and actually, if you pay attention to the lyrics they are telling a story about how she has gone through a lot of pain and anger through failed relationships lately, so that the cathartic yelling about how she wants to watch her ex die actually is part of the bigger picture of how she has gone through the anger, which turned into an acceptance (eg 'i don't give a') and finally by the last song a kind of sad farewell and a moving on in 'falling free'.<br /><br />overall even though i've had a decent amount of criticism, i do like the cd, and i will keep listening to see if it grows on me. right now i kind of don't think it will as much as confessions did, but you never know. if i find myself liking it more in the following weeks, i may add another star to the review. right now i would give it 3.5 stars.o give her music credibility to appeal to a younger audience. it feels forced and in my opinion doesn't fit her. i DO happen to like lil wayne, but i don't care for how she seems to be channeling him in 'gang bang' when she starts yelling 'drive bitch!

0345803485|4.0|Let me get this out there: I like pop music, I read all the Twilight and Hunger Games books, and I'm over 30.  I also have this theory.  That Katy Perry song on the radio?  It's not supposed to change the freaking world.  It's just supposed to entertain you.  It's fun.  And that's okay.<br /><br />I feel the same way about the Fifty Shades series.<br /><br />Let's look at it this way.  Ms. James started out writing a fanfic based on a story she enjoyed.  Enough people liked it that she transformed it into its own story.  (Even if it does have some unmistakable echoes of the Twilight series.  I heard them, I'm not a dumb dumb.)  Even then, enough people liked it that she self-published and THEN, still more people liked it enough that it became a bestseller.  Whether that's a sign of talent or luck or perseverance or a selling of one's soul to the fiery beast below (yes, I do mean Mario Lopez*), who knows?  Who cares?  If you want a piece of the pie or you think you could do it better, what's stopping you?<br /><br />I digress.<br /><br />I won't lie to you all.  This isn't a literary masterpiece and it never presented itself to be one.  It's also fiction, meaning that it's just a story for you to digest.  Does it intend to leave some broad, social impact on its readers?  I don't think so.  Remember?  FICTIONAL CHARACTERS.  It's not real.  It's just entertainment.  In the end, the purpose was to just to put on a good show.<br /><br />ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?<br /><br />I have to admit, though, that her butchering of basic geography hurt my Washingtonian senses a bit.  Why is Ray from Montesano, of all places?  How many times does Ana have to refer to herself as a \\"Washington resident\\"?  Does she understand where Portland is in regard to Vancouver and Seattle?  (Hint: It's further south.)<br /><br />Something that didn't bother me?  The use of British English, because even as a real Hulkamaniac American, I talk funny and use odd phrases that are either old-fashioned or not widely used in the U.S.  I think it's funny that people are getting hung up on that.<br /><br />So, what's my review?

0345803507|5.0|The third book in this trilogy brings an exciting conclusion to the Grey experience. I read the entire series in under one week ! I could not put these books down ! EL James does an amazing job bringing these characters to life ! Can't wait to read more from this author !
B007549YM4|5.0|Never heard of it but just watched it and thought it was pretty great.  It's dark and twisted but if you're into those sorts of movies I think you'll dig it - you definitely won't hate it.  I thought the score was really good as well.  2 hours well spent.
0553582038|4.0|In George R.R. Martins, \\"A Feast for Crows\\",  the fourth book in the \\"A Song Of Ice and Fire\\" series, the book strays from the path of the rest of the series.  A \\"Feast for Crows\\" focuses only on the characters in Kings Landing and the Seven Kingdoms, leaving out several other important characters in the rest of the series.  The main theme of this book is about watching characters, good and evil, grow stronger and truer characters.  Between Sam Tarly, Jon Snow, Jaime Lannister, and Littlefinger, everyone is stepping up to the bat in this game of thrones.<br /> Jaime Lannister and Littlefinger, not known for their human compassion or understanding seem to have turned a new leaf in \\"A Feast for Crows\\".  With the loss of his sword hand, Jaime has lost what men fear/respect him for the most and is therefore forced to focus on his wits and leadership.  After Sansa Stark escaped from Kings Landing, Jaime not only sends Brienne of Tarth to fulfill his oath to Catelyn Stark, but he provides her with a new valerian sword, (Oathbreaker), a sack of gold, and a royal declaration from King Tommen that she is on official royal business.  Jaime is not only doing his best to fulfill his oath to Catelyn Stark to protect her children, but he is also showing respect to Brienne, something that she is in short supply of.  Littlefinger also appears to care for someone other than himself.  He helps Sansa escape, under the guise of his natural born daughter, and takes to protecting her.  Though anterior motives are most likely in store, as he steals more than one kiss from her, he arranges a new marriage for her and actually seems to be trying to make a new life for her.  Both characters carve morally better identities for themselves in this fourth installment of the series.<br /> Jon Snow finds himself in quite the predicament in \\"A Feast of Crows\\".  With the offer from King Stannis to reclaim his Stark heritage, he is tempted to abandon The Wall when he is needed most.  However, he is elected into a different role of power and loses his chance to finally become Ned Starks true child.  With his new role he quickly changes and hardens himself.  Jon grows from a boy and steward to Lord Mormont to a man full grown, sacrificing everything in order to ensure the safety of the realm.<br /> Samuel Tarly, morphs from a complete craven to \\"Slayer\\", and embarks on an adventure he never thought himself capable of.  In \\"A Feast of Crows\\", Sam is seen scheming, breaking vows, and standing up for people.  Though the combination may seem bad, Sam is finally becoming the man his father always wanted him to be.  Strong, smart, successful, and a leader to his group.<br /> Although George Martin decided to cut the fourth book and only concentrate on characters in the Seven Kingdoms, his decision is fortified as a good one when we see how all of the people we either love or love to hate become better stronger versions than those introduced to us in \\"A Game of Thrones\\".
B007549W62|5.0|this movie is pretty damn intense. You'll have to watch Whatever you consider Comedy and will make you laugh your guts out after watching this movie......i mean i usually love watching this type of movie---survival after a holocast,, but this movie is like \\"The Road,\\" bleak, but it Does mesmerize and hold your attention! No it isn't as graphic as a usual Zombie movie, but this Unrated version will make you want to consider suicide if faced with similiar circumstances...I need to watch something light and funny now.....i'm good:-) later!

B000V4UFZK|5.0|I remember that I went to see this film with my buddy in early summer 1982 and we thought it was really scary.  The movie begins with a light-hearted, humorous tone but things get pretty tense rather quickly.  Who can forget that creepy tree right outside the house, the scary clown, the face-ripping scene, and that intense swimming pool scene in the climax.  The film is rated PG and the PG-13 rating did not come around till around 1984 or 1985.  I am sure if this movie was to be released today it would be rated PG-13.  Craig T. Nelson and Jobeth Williams are great as the parents of some very likeable and believable kids.  Their family is so likeable that you really get emotionally involved in the action and their hopes of saving Carol Anne and the rest of the family.<br /><br />There has been a lot of controversy over who actually directed the film.  Steven Spielberg was the producer while Tobe Hooper was the director.  The movie has Spielberg's fingerprints all over it.  Hooper may have directed the film but Spielberg obviously called the shots.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app it is so helpful to me when I need to know the weather and I cant get to the t.v.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|me and my brother love this game but there is only one thing I  don't like it needs an update and there is only 2 worlds
0345803485|1.0|I bought into the hype and purchased this book.  To say I am disappointed would be an understatement.  This is one of the most poorly written books that I have ever attempted to read.  The writing is repetive and the plot is boring at best.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this is a great game! I can get passed wave 50. if someone could give me some advice to beat it would help. either way great and complex game
B004UID2LC|5.0|best app ever i love it i get like tons of vids on it. it is like the cooles app ever
B00479SVBU|2.0|It was the only option to add USB to factory radio. Line out sounds much better than fm modulator. It would be nice if it remembered the track that was playing without using the bookmark feature.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I have read all the books in the Song of Fire & Ice series so I was excited when I heard HBO was making a tv series based off the books.  I was only able to catch random episodes when the series originally aired but I loved what I saw.  I bought the dvd because I knew I wanted it no matter what because I'm such a fan of the books.  After I watched the complete series through I was impressed how close the series was to the books.  I loved the first season.  The dvd came with maps of Westeros and other fun extras that give more information about the characters.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.  I recommend!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its awesome never seen so many games in one app<br />u guys sure know how to get good games love it so cool u all have to play them
B0036BK6MW|5.0|good for children of all ages.this movie will show people that the world is made up with good people who have compassion.i cried at times during the movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved reading this. It was such a good storyline and was really easy to read. It was definitely a page turner. I couldn't put it down.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the way the game requires you to beat certain scores to earn points. then use them points to acquire more games.
B007IX383I|2.0|We're Here Because We're Here was also a \\"pretty\\" album. But it was also powerful and moving.<br />Weather Systems, unfortunately, sounds like Anathema tried to re-make WHBWH, and failed.<br />The songs are weak and leave no impression. The lyrics are syrupy sweet, romantic drivel without any depth.<br />I give two stars instead of one because there is a certain likable, pop-like quality to the album, but that is as far as it goes.<br />As a fan of much of Anathema's other work, I was very disappointed with this effort.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|a bit predictable but who cares?  the cast is wonderful, India is captivating.  You will like this movie, especially if you are a tiny bit over the hill
B004T2QZL8|3.0|Some of the things you have to create aren't really logical or they just serve as puns (which can be amusing, but it means you spend a lot of time just randomly combining things). The help function is nice, so you aren't completely lost. The graphics are really nice to look at too.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|good graphics fun and easy to play all ages could play this game u can unlock new objects to use against the zombies.+more.
B005J0VPNC|2.0|I saw this featured in a magazine and thought it might make a fun addition to my Samsung Fascinate, but found it didn't do much more than my other camera apps. It really just took up space and when I used it, it distorted the pictures beyond recognition which wasn't really what I wanted. If you are looking for something fun to play around with, this could be a good app to test. Maybe you'll get more use than I did.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I really like this game it is a good time passing game to play when you just don't want to think :) I have seen many people complainning about the glitches and uninstalling the game as they do not want to wait the 200+ hour timers. Now I know doing this will use up supplies however it will allow you to keep playing.  I am level 34 right now and I have only had to do this a couple times.  When somthing has a timer glitch sell it and recreate it.  The only other glitch I saw was this morning when I had 4 quests restart on me when I was almost done with them.  That is a pain but I will deal it.
B003CN5SAY|5.0|Wasn't exactly what I was expecting, but at least now I can lay the story to rest and move on with my life. I started watching the series when I was in high school and only recently had the time to finish the series (college will do that to you). The collection (all seasons) come in a really sturdy case, which makes the collection very visibly appealing to look at, and the story itself is very interesting. I bought this during the black Friday sale, so that made the value even better!
0470901071|5.0|The first book that was delivered to me was bound wrong and had pages sticking out of it!! However, I returned the book and promptly received a replacement :) Wonderful review book!!
B005529BDK|3.0|I enjoyed this game for a little while, but then I grew tired of it and deleted it. The visuals were nice and the music wasn't terrible, but the premise just wasn't for me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am just starting to read the book but am enjoying it and have heard great things from other people who have read it.  I also like ordering the books on my kindle - easy and great way to read!  Thanks for your service!
1469984202|5.0|Other reviewers have chimed in, so I won't be verbose. I agree with almost everything positive said! The story grabs you from the start, and just when you think you have figured out the next turn, the next logical development takes you by surprise! The surprises grow out of the information presented, so it's not like 'oh suddenly a ufo appears and gives someone super powers.' No, these surprises build out of the characters and the environment, and make perfect sense. And the ending is great! I want more!
B006ZDU7QI|4.0|Other than the one song, \\"Somebody That I Used to Know\\", I'd never heard of this band.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that I genuinely like all the songs on the album.  Each song is different from the others.  Overall, a treat and welcome change from the usual.
B0029O08WA|4.0|love this soundtrack, love all the twilight music.  what else could you ask for, each of the songs is good and reminds me of the movie
B006ON41FC|5.0|The game is addictive, and my family likes it to. This is an excellent choice for the price of 1 dollar
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This was a easy read. I really enjoyed this book. Once I started I couldn't put it down. I will most definitely read this authors other books.
B0063IH60K|5.0|App works great.  Very fun and easy to use.  Nice interface and graphics as well.<br />Have been using for weeks with no issues.
B005MYWZIO|5.0|I didn't know about the hype of this guy; I was simply watching Rage one morning (Australian music program), and the usual dribble that assualts me at that time of morning was instantly transformed by this guy singing 'home again.'<br /><br />I didn't get it. Here was a young man in 2012, singing like he belonged in the 'oldies' section of my CD collection. I thought, 'i'll keep an ear out for him', and proceeded to answer the questions being asked of me by my assignment...<br /><br />... but I couldn't get it out of my head. I couldn't remember any of the words, and I could only remember but half his name; Google did the rest. Still not having heard anything from him apart from the brief snippet caught by my half inclined ear during that sleepy Saturday morning in Darwin, I found out that his album was being released soon.<br /><br />Long story short, I acquired the damn thing.<br /><br />I am a musician. I am a musicologist (among other things). I am a tough man to please when it comes to 'new' talent. But after one listening, this album went straight onto the ipod, the iphone, the USB stick in the car, and the 'spare' mp3 player... IMMEDIATELY.<br /><br />It's not the most amazing thing you'll ever hear. It's not going to rock the music world to its foundations; especially not the industry as it is today. For instance, he doesn't promise to get undressed, drunk, arrested; surprisingly, he doesn't offer to undress anyone else. He doesn't pee on anyone, and he doesn't defame the male or female gender claiming that all men or women are a$$holes. He doesn't even get all ragamuffin on anyone's behind - it is a really under the radar thing he's done here. He's almost come out saying, 'i don't care if this doesn't make me a millionaire - here it is anyway!' But what an understanding this man has of music!!! This album is really deeply beautiful; the ingredients are all right! He gets it, and I am a fan.<br /><br />If you can get a hold of it, be sure to grab the 'deluxe' version, as it has 15 songs on it as opposed to the standard 10 on the normal release. Some of those extra 5 songs are different versions of the album songs, but 3 of them are new and strong enough to be on the album proper. 'Ode to you' is a standout of the entire release, although it's not on the normal release. This is why I exhort you to keep searching for the deluxe version - it is worth it.<br /><br />Anyone looking for something old in something new, this is it. Michael Kiwanuka is the reincarnate Curtis Mayfield; he is the new Bill Withers. And whilst these giants of the genre spring to mind when one listens to Michael, there is something undeniably new about this man that defies comparison, and so should their be. Otherwise, why would anyone buy this instead of an original Withers or Mayfield classic? No, this album is not a reaching back to revive a forgotten vibe - it's a recreation of that vibe relevant for today. Unfortunately, I don't think it will be relevant for today's 'people'. Don't let it pass you by.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|A pretty simple defends game, but the leveling elements give it an extra bit of depth. I have been enjoying it.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I really like this game. Enough challenge to keep me interested but not too hard.  I can see they are cashing in on the Plants vs Zombies name, which is a better game. I give it five stars cause it's addictive, free and has posed no problems so far.
B002NULL9E|5.0|I was very pleased with the service and quality of the product I purchased.  It arrived, actually, earlier than anticipated.  I have ordered many times with Amazon and each time has been a favorable outcome.

1451627289|4.0|11/22/1963 is a day that will live in infamy....just like December 7 1941, and the September 11th attacks...we have never forgotten the day when 3 shots rang out in Deely Plaza that sunny Friday afternoon. This book takes the reading back in time to that tragic day when America lost a beloved President, but what would have happened if that days events never occured. King explored this subject with great detail, covering everything from begining to end. Jake Epping, takes a trip from 2011 to Sept 9 1958, and throughout the course of this book, he attempts to stop the assassination of JFK. We find out that although Lee Harvey Oswald is a smallish man, who appears to be mild mannered, is actually a man with a verocious temper, and a wife beater. He was never a fan of the President, and wanted to make sure that he was dead. He goes to great length to get this accomplished, but will he succeed? This book has some twists and turns, a lot of historical fact to back it up. This book may take you awhile, weighing in at 849 pages, but it is worth every minute....Excellent!
0345803485|4.0|Loved this book.  It was very hot and with that said I was not bothered by the trite comments of the main character (\\"Oh My\\").  I read the book very quickly which is also a reflection of the simple no nonsense writing style.  Working my way through the series now.
0345803493|4.0|Second book is different from first but that isn't a bad thing.  You still get your steamy descriptions but the story has actually evolved a bit and grown outside of just Anastasia and Christian.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and read it very quickly.  I know this isn't Shakespeare but I'm okay with that. Can't wait to move onto the 3rd book!
B005RJI67I|4.0|My daughter loves Harry Potter, so being able to find some unique Harry Potter Lego kits was a bonus for me!  She was so excited, put them together right away and has them displayed on her shelf with her Harry Potter books and other HP Lego sets.
B004S26HB2|1.0|I like Guy's posts and I read them quite frequently. However, this book was a great disappointment. The main reason is that, at least in my opinion, it was really vague. Imagine that it has been almost two weeks since I bought it and when I got the reminder from Amazon to write a review I couldn't even remember what it was all about. Then I opened my kidle to try to remember why I didn't manage to finish it. Well, I can tell now what I didn't like. It was all about \\"enchantment\\" and how to inspire others, and how to project your passions and think great and dress well and say yes to everybody (!), tell nice stories, show up, self promote and lots of other fake PR tricks. Well, sorry for being strict but personally I don't think that all this image making is the key to success. Somebody has to work first and be distinguished for the quality of his intellectual and professional product. Just showing up and smile and saying nice stories is very superficial. The fact that such an \\"advice\\" attracts such goods reviews is, in my humble opinion, a sign of our times.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A class game of solitaire. You will really enjoy playing this. Challenge yourself and test the logic in this well written app
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|There is a glitch in the game for timers. Normally it takes 3 mins to harvest your pigs, but when the glitch kicks in around level 12 they take 12 hours. I experienced this on 2 different installs of the game. I got to level 19 the first time then it happened. I uninstalled and reinstalled. I got to level 12 the second time. I will be uninstalling it and NEVER wasting my time with it again!!!
0201485672|5.0|Despite refactoring all day, this book finally taught me how, all with the first chapter.  You do it incrementally, until you can make the \\"real\\" change that you wanted to make trivially, or easily.  Or if there's a code smell, why, you refactor that out just to get rid of its smell.  Affected my programming style quite a bit, in a good way.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Holy Moses!!!  I am completing this interview as I peek from under my lashes while blushing eight shades of crimson.  Holy cow, this book is repetitive. I must murmer that the subject matter seemed interesting but HOLY CRAP, it's not impressive whatsoever.<br />I wish there were a program that counted the number of times the expression \\"HOLY (fill in the blank)\\" was used.  And how many different shades of red she blushed, or how many times she murmured or peeked from under her lashes or how many times she felt something stirring from down \\"there\\" or checked email on her mean machine.<br />I reminded myself that this book was probably written for a young audience but still, it wasn't written well.  I wondered why the editing department didn't help out with the flow of the words or perhaps offer a thesaurus. Holy cow.<br /><br />The protagonist becomes involved with a dominant and he - HOLY CRAP - deflowers her and they fall in love and have to work with his issues.  The steamy scenes were laced with goofy expressions and a little over the top with her passion but that's why we read these kind of books, right?<br /><br />If you're interested in the subject of a submissive/dominant relationship, try Nine 1/2 Weeks
0345528581|5.0|By far the best book on bodyweight exercises.  The workouts are staightforward, quick, very tiring, and amazingly effective, without causing injury.  If followed regularly this book will change your life.  I've become stronger, leaner, more alert and just plain better by following these workouts.  I also use the inexpensive companion Android App (there is an iPhone app as well), which is great and makes it so simple to follow the workouts.  My sincere thanks for Mark Lauren for putting this book on the market.
B00003CXXP|5.0|Is it science fiction or a philosophical exploration? My favourite Spielberg movie is both a visual delight and an intellectual feast.<br /><br />It is essential to begin at the beginning. The world created by the film makers is due to the excess of consumption of the human species. The issue is often packaged to sell political support. More power for some and less for others. In A.I. the consequences of rising sea levels are clearly expressed. Cities have disappeared. But technology still prospers.<br /><br />Love is packaged in the shape of a boy. Unquestioning real love. But how many parents treat their boys and girls like toys? This is the heart of the movie. Uneasy viewing for the conscious parent.<br /><br />The boy's journey to find the way to become real takes us to another level. A robot being rational and learning about its own motivation. Learning how to fight. To hold hands. Gaining intuition. And all the time I realised that he was becoming more human than the humans destroying things around him. Our consumer psyche has eroded the caring instinct. We produce and consume far more than we need in order to provide the essentials of life: food, water, clothes, heating and shelter. The balance is wrong. The craving for power is measured by money.<br /><br />I first saw A. I. on the 21st September 2001 at a cinema. The ticket lies in the jacket of the 2002 dvd. Now I view it flat-screen but with the kind of depth which only wisdom can hope to provide. I am eleven years older and still have no urge to raise children. Not just because the world is out of balance but for the sake of my own sense of equilibrium. I believe in what is natural and real. Everything matters. Everybody is important. Whilst the politicians prattle-on in broad sweeps of social rhetoric, I know that it is details which matter. Funnelling massive amounts of resources into Armies and weaponry is at the cost of prosperity for every individual. Nobody talks of full employment, only `our best interests.' The Blue Fairy runs this satellite-covered planet. Can you recall the last intelligent conversation you had? We are being separated from our instincts.interests.'

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|They were a super quick and easy download to my nook.  These books reminded me of an old story \\"The Lottery\\" we read in grade school, only much more exciting and detailed.  I thought it was excellent!  The characters were very easy to empathize and get caught up in their stories.
B000654OUG|4.0|Uchida is a splendid pianist, technically impeccable. She can also be very musical. But her rendering of Schubert is not to my taste. She plays with a samurai's sword in her mind where the music would call for a more tender and open... hand. The dynamic contrasts and tempo changes are razor sharp, but I would expect many to be a little more blunt and suggestive. To do a complete cycle like this of Schubert's piano music is no small feat, but it does not serve me the whole of Schubert's spirit. I don't have complete cycles of Schubert from Perahia or Lupu, but I definitely prefer their offering. Uchida's remains a noteworthy undertaking, but I cannot recommend it wholeheartedly.
B003Y5H5B0|1.0|My wife and I went to see this movie, being fans of the original show.  To say it was a let down is a HUGE understatement.<br /><br />I'm a fan of Channing Tatum, and he is usually very good in whatever role he is in, but he could only do so much with this script.<br /><br />The humor would only appeal to people who love raunchy jokes that take no creativity or imagination.  There must have been at least a hundred references to a certain part of the male anatomy throughout the film, and I'm being conservative there.<br /><br />These guys are supposed to go back to high school as undercover narcs, and you you would think that would be cool and funny, but this is like dumber and dumbest in high school, minus the laughs. Anyway, I believe the joke is on you if you watch this movie, but go see it if you don't believe me.<br /><br />I give this a 1 out of 5.
B003Y3ZTGA|4.0|Nice song has all my favorite in one album worth paying for it. Love it  not like other albums where you get only one hit or two and pay double the price. Cant go wrong with this.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|The first movie in this series was excellent, the second not so much, and the third one was really good.<br /><br />Ghost Protocol blows them ALL away.  Great action sequences, CG, drama, suspense, you name it, this movie has it all.<br /><br />This is blockbuster movie action at it's finest!<br /><br />I don't know how he does it, I think Cruise is like 50??, but he still looks great, and still comes out in great films.<br /><br />5 stars easily.

Sandel<br /><br />\\" What Money Can't Buy\\" is the thought-provoking book that asks the ethical question, \\"Are there some things that money can buy but shouldn't?\\" With a plethora of fascinating examples, best-selling author and famed Harvard professor Michael J. Sandel once again dazzles the mind with philosophical mind teasers. In this enlightening edition, Sandel challenges the reader with economic ethics, are economic markets replacing our moral judgments? Sandel insists that these are questions that society needs to answer and decide what values should govern our social and civic life. What sets Sandel apart is precisely his ability to ask thought-provoking questions and provide lucid perspectives. This 245-page book is composed of the following five chapters: 1. Jumping the Queue, 2. Incentives, 3. How Markets Crowd Out Morals, 4. Markets in Life and Death, and 5. Naming Rights.<br /><br />Positives:<br />1. Elegant, conversational tone that makes this book a treat to read.<br />2. As thought-provoking a book as you will find.<br />3. So many fascinating economic topics covered in a brief book.<br />4. Philosophy made fun. Sandel writes with panache.<br />5. So easy to understand yet so profound.<br />6. Very even-handed approach. Does a great job of addressing issues from different perspectives.<br />7. Sandel challenges you to think. His trademark engaging style draws you in and just when you thought you had it all figured out he forces you to rethink your position. Excellent!<br />8. A great job of defining the role of our markets.<br />9. A master at providing countless examples of modern moral dilemmas.<br />10. The creative minds of the free markets...interesting business models. Line standing business applied to several businesses as a curious example.<br />11. Some examples will test your moral fiber. I'm not going to spoil it.<br />12. Thought-provoking questions abound, \\"Under what conditions do market reflect freedom of choice, and under what conditions do they exert a kind of coercion?\\"<br />13. An interesting look at education and pay for grades programs.<br />14. Health bribes...do they work?<br />15. Perverse situations...what would you do?<br />16. The morality of environmental preservation, climate change, endangered species.<br />17. Great quotes, \\"Morality represents the way we would like to work, and economics represents how it actually does work.\\"<br />18. What money can and cannot buy and why. Great stuff.<br />19. A fascinating look at the \\"value\\" of life. Enlightening.<br />20. The naming rights chapter goes over the business and ethics of paying for ads in practically every aspect of our lives.<br />21. Being the big baseball fan that I am I was happy to see a couple of sections on baseball.<br />22. The two running objections of laissez-faire argument: coercion and unfairness. Plenty of examples.<br />23. Insight into public marketing.<br />24. The positives and negatives of commercialism.<br />25. Comprehensive notes section.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1. So good it was too brief...I wanted more.<br />2. Perhaps not as great as Sandel's previous book: \\"Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do?\\" but it is still an excellent book.<br />3. Folks on opposite side of the political spectrum may have something to complain about and that may be a good thing.<br />4. Surprised there wasn't many shenanigans from Wall Street. That would have taken several books though.<br />5. Not a ground breaking book just better asked questions.<br /><br />In summary, I enjoyed this book, it will give you topics to discuss for years to come. What sets Sandel apart is his innate ability to ask interesting questions and provide well thought out answers. Few authors have that innate ability to draw you in and make you ponder your arguments. The book has few shortcomings including the fact that is indeed a short book and a lot may in fact be logical to many. A 4.5star book out of five. That being said, if you are looking for a philosophical book that is a treat to read, \\"What Money Can't Buy\\" is worth every penny. I highly recommend it!<br /><br />Further suggestions: The excellent, \\"[[ASIN:0374532508 Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do?]]\\" by Michael J.

0143119680|5.0|A richly inventive novel about a centuries-old vampire, a spellbound witch, and the mysterious manuscript that draws them together.<br />Deep in the stacks of Oxford's Bodleian Library, young scholar Diana Bishop unwittingly calls up a bewitched alchemical manuscript in the course of her research. Descended from an old and distinguished line of witches, Diana wants nothing to do with sorcery; so after a furtive glance and a few notes, she banishes the book to the stacks. But her discovery sets a fantastical underworld stirring, and a horde of daemons, witches, and vampires soon descends upon the library. Diana has stumbled upon a coveted treasure lost for centuries-and she is the only creature who can break its spell.<br /><br />Holy sh**balls! I don't know if my standards for a good book have been low for a while, or if I'm just kind of stupid, but after reading \\"A Discovery of Witches\\", my definition of a good book has definitely been upgraded.<br /><br />The story itself is definitely rich with prose, plot, and characters with great depth. Deborah tells a story of unconventional love, in an unconventional way. I almost began worrying that this was going to turn out to be another Twilight romance, but this was very much less \\"teen-angsty\\". The scenes where Diana uses her powers are simple, and yet still make your skin tingle wanting to see her do more. I am in love with this book and it's characters and cannot wait for the next in line to come out. Deborah Harkness makes an engrossing tale that will capture the attention and devotion of many readers.

0345522478|5.0|Synopsis:<br /><br />Atticus O'Sullivan, last of the Druids, lives peacefully in Arizona, running an occult bookshop and shape-shifting in his spare time to hunt with his Irish wolfhound. His neighbors and customers think that this handsome, tattooed Irish dude is about twenty-one years old--when in actuality, he's twenty-one centuries old. Not to mention: He draws his power from the earth, possesses a sharp wit, and wields an even sharper magical sword known as Fragarach, the Answerer.<br /><br />Unfortunately, a very angry Celtic god wants that sword, and he's hounded Atticus for centuries. Now the determined deity has tracked him down, and Atticus will need all his power--plus the help of a seductive goddess of death, his vampire and werewolf team of attorneys, a sexy bartender possessed by a Hindu witch, and some good old-fashioned luck of the Irish--to kick some Celtic arse and deliver himself from evil.<br /><br />My Thoughts:<br /><br />How could I resist reading this book for so long?! It was only a matter of time though before I did read it. What's not to love with a character who's Irish, can use magic, is over two centuries old, and is a badass? Nothing I tell you. Hounded was definitely a treat to read and I cannot wait to delve into the sequel, Hexed, but alas, I must wait until the gods of wealth decide to bless me with enough to afford a new book. Kevin Hearne does a great job of building the scenes with imagery and mood, and since I live near the area the book is centered in, I can attest that it is all VERY real.<br /><br />Oberon, the main character, Atticus's Irish Wolfhound, has got to be one of my favorite characters. I love how his mind is always stuck on sausage and French Poodles, which I feel is true to what a dog's thoughts would be stuck on. The relationship built between Atticus and Oberon, and other characters for that matter, are given realistic tones and we are allowed glimpses into the mind of a 2,100 year-old druid. The plot is full and teeming with action, mystery and suspense, which helps to keep things fast-paced, but not so fast that you get lost as a reader. I feel like my thoughts are all over the place with this review, because there are so many good things I want to point out, but that would make this post ridiculously long and I know most of us are pretty ADD in today's world, so I will end it with this:GO. GET. THIS. BOOK. NOW.<br /><br />Kevin Hearne's newest book in the Iron Druid Chronicles, Tricked, is set for release on April 24, 2012.

B00005M989|5.0|PRINCE-THE VERY BEST OF PRINCE: MICHAEL JACKSON may have gotten more press but the REAL visionary of the eighties was a sawed off Minneapolis funk whirlwind who dubbed himself PRINCE. Not only could this elusive, erotic multi-talent belt like STEVIE WONDER and step like JAMES BROWN, he also penned huge pop hits for THE BANGLES, TOM JONES, SINEAD O'CONNOR, SHEILA E and CHAKA KAHN. His falsetto-enshrouded debut ditty I WANNA BE YOUR LOVER and the one-two club-floor punch of 1999 and LITTLE RED CORVETTE set the table for mega-charters from the heat-sinking soundtrack PURPLE RAIN, (including the nine minute title saga) as well as sexually charged follow ups such as RASPBERRY BERET, the SHEENA EASTON duet U GOT THE LOOK, and CREAM. Were it not for his legendary eclecticism and highly experimental nature, PRINCE could have no doubt churned out radio smashes right into the new millenium...as it is, THE VERY BEST captures the master at the absolute peak of his purple powers.<br /><br />RATING: FIVE SMIRKS

B0000AMRJD|5.0|A true crime and cinematic classic that has become a cult favorite among crime obsessed hip-hoppers over the years. The attitudes expressed by Tony Montana in this fictional account of a Cuban exile becoming a Miami cocaine kingpin have branded themselves onto hip-hop and the drug game. This is drug dealer 101, learn the rules of the game and what not to do by watching this film. The by \\"any means necessary\\" mindset embodied by Tony Montana is a must for any drug dealer interested in rising above street level. This movie is an all-time classic. Its formula has been repeated but never replicated. Tony Montana aka Scarface has become a national icon in pop culture and is up there with John Gotti, Pablo Escobar, Frank Lucas and Supreme McGriff in the chronicles of gangster lore.
B006XBSAP2|4.0|Teenage Dream is one of my favorite albums to come out in the last few years. Firework is inspirational, Teenage Dream is a blissful song and Pearl kills me. When I heard about the complete confection, I was intrigued and decided to pick up a copy.<br /><br />Wide Awake is an awesome song I can't get enough of. Part of Me is pretty good, but Dressin' Up seems like a track that didn't keep up with the original feeling of the album. I sort of wish for the price, Katy Perry had added something more to the disc to make it worthwhile for the fans. 3 new tracks for fans and a few remixes that were big on iTunes pushed the limits. But I did buy it.<br /><br />If you don't own Teenage Dream, this is the version to buy. If you do, you might want to take some time thinking about this purchase.

B005EGXTEE|5.0|I have always been able to put a book down, no matter how exciting or interesting it is. This was not the case with The Hunger Games. I literally could not put it down, to the point where, during my exam period, I stayed up until 5am to finish reading the book. The world that Suzanne Collins creates sucks you in until you are unaware of anything but Panem, Katniss and the Hunger Games. The characters are amazing and the plot always has you turning the page (to the point where you skim a whole chapter, read it again in detail, and want to finish the book as soon as possible just so you could read the whole book again). There were so many great moments in the book, whether it dealt with the relationships or the action sequences or the political drama behind the story. It was an enthralling read, one which I highly recommend. It's great reading this story in an eBook because I can bookmark several pages, make notes and highlight passages without making a physical mark on the page itself, and I really appreciate the search function and dictionary that the eBook provides.
0345803485|2.0|Regardless of your feelings about \\"mommy porn\\" or all of the media hype surrounding this book, its biggest problem lies in the fact that it really is just poorly written.  I tried to give it a fair chance, I really did, but the best I can say about it is that the cover is a step above the usual romantic fair featuring a scantily clad woman clinging to a well-muscled hero.  Anais Nin Ms. James is not.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|Catching Fire was a great sequel of the first of the trilogy, The Hunger Games. It gave a good arch of each relationship and established very interesting character development throughout the book. It starts off a bit slow but soon the plot experiences many twists and turns, revisiting similar experiences with new twists (such as the different environment of the terrain of the Quarter Quell and the friendships/alliances Katniss and Peeta choose to forge). It's great reading this story in an eBook because I can bookmark several pages, make notes and highlight passages without making a physical mark on the page itself, and I really appreciate the search function and dictionary that the eBook provides.
B002S9DRA6|5.0|I have always loved Enigma music, so this was a no-brainer.  Absolutely wonderful!  I will forever be a fan, and this was a great deal. Thanks.
B005EGXTL2|4.0|Mockingjay is an almost disapointing but incredibly necessary conclusion to The Hunger Games trilogy. This, in no way, reflects on Suzanne Collins' brilliant storytelling. The writing is just as poignant and page-turning as the previous two books. The plot and character developmet demands that the trilogy end in a manner that may not be desirable (from the characters' points of view) but as the reader, you still engage and sympathise with the changes of all of the characters. How the plot unfolds is undesirable but realistic and very true to the nature of the trilogy. If you have already read the first two books, it is essential that you read Mockingjay. The whole picture is finally explained and, as a reader, you are finally given the satisfaction of a real conclusion. It's great reading this story in an eBook because I can bookmark several pages, make notes and highlight passages without making a physical mark on the page itself, and I really appreciate the search function and dictionary that the eBook provides.
0345803485|1.0|Poorly written, aimless story, boring....can't understand the hype.  Anastasia is so annoying that it distracts from any redeeming  qualities the book may have had.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of my better purchases.  I was a little worried about buying it because I wasn't sure if I would enjoy it, but from the moment I picked it up, I could not put it down until I was completely finished the whole series.  In fact, after having read the series once, it's taking a bit of self control to not pick it up again.<br /><br />If you're a Harry Potter fan, or a fan of fantastical places with a dark history/story, this book is very much for you.  I highly recommend this to people of all ages.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved this book, I was not expecting to love this book at all. I read the first page of bad reviews and i was going to pass it up.Then they were discussing it on the radio and i needed something new to read and said why not. I had no idea what it was about other then erotic fiction. Well, i fell in love with the series not just the book. I read all 3 books in 3 days!!! i didn't want to stop reading the story just sucks you in. I hope E L James continues with the series or creates a new series because now i am hooked!
B0071MV540|3.0|I guess the movie was fine.  It kept shutting down about every 15 minutes which was very annoying.<br /><br />Turns out the perseverance of Amazon's tech department found the solution, but I'm not too happy about that.....the Amazon service was terrific, the Panasonic Blu-Ray player was the problem.  Turns out Panasonic has an issue with streaming playback via wifi.  There is no apparent fix at this time.  I bought a Roku box, altho I haven't had a chance to stream Amazon movies thru it yet.

This is one of those books that I don't want to give too much away in my review, so I'll keep it brief.<br /><br />This book is about a 14yr old boy, Jacob, who is indicted for the murder of a fellow classmate, Ben, when his fingerprint showed up on the victims clothing. However, Jacob's father is convinced of his innocence and defends and fights for him at his trial to keep him from going to prison. And I can't tell you anymore than that.<br /><br />This is a must read.

B005JLN9ZI|5.0|I haven't been a huge fan of Drake. Out of the songs  that I had listened to on the radio, I just thought he was OK. Maybe another one hit wonder. I did like his song \\"Successful\\" from his mixtape but that was about it.<br /><br />I had seen some good reviews on this album though and when I saw the $5 download on Amazon, I got it. I love all the slow, easy listening songs on this album, way better than what's on the radio. I can't pinpoint what exactly about his rapping style that I like but I guess its just smooth and sleek. I also looked up the wikipedia page for the album, so many producers worked on this album and it shows. This is one of the best rap albums of the year, or at least best produced, almost, just almost like a Kanye West album. I feel like I can relate to a lot of what his songs are about.<br /><br />* Note: The Motto didn't come on the download, so I might just have to download it at an extra cost<br /><br />Best songs:<br />- The Ride, I like how he goes in and out of first person / third person. You don't know if he's talking about himself or someone else (at first). I feel that he did this to better explain what he's going through by looking at his life from the outside<br /><br />- Lord Knows, Rick Ross really makes this a stand out song. It almost sounds like a Kanye song with the choir background singing. I can't get enough of this song. One of the best produced songs on the album.<br /><br />- Hyfr, Everyone's heard this song. Its just a good party song, when you just want have a good time. The chorus will stay in your head for an entire week Hell Yeah, Hell Yeah Hell Yeah, Effin Right...

B005S9EJZA|4.0|I have this subversive image of Nicholas Sparks in a wifebeater at the computer, angrily pounding the keyboards and listening to death metal while a burly biker gives him a tat. Because a guy can't be that wholesome and sensitive, can he? Except that, like clockwork, Sparks' bestselling novels keep getting made into films. THE LUCKY ONE is merely the latest adaptation.<br /><br />This is Hollywood, babe, so we shouldn't harp on them heaps of uncanny coincidences. Such as these: In Iraq, the morning after a harrowing exchange of gunfire with the enemy, U.S. Marine Sergeant Logan Thibault (Zac Efron) gets off his duff and picks up a photo he glimpses lying in the rubble. Suddenly, there's an explosion right where he had been sitting, and that's when the notion probably first struck him that the photo is some sort of lucky charm. Eight months later, Logan's third tour of duty ends and he's going home, that photo still tucked away in his keeping. Logan regards the mysterious girl in the photo as his guardian angel, someone who'd kept him safe and breathing. He wants to find her and thank her. But he doesn't know who she is.<br /><br />Back home, Logan Thibault is unable to settle down, and off he goes with his dog, walking, just walking. In his wanderings, he crosses several states and eventually ends up at a family-run dog kennel in Louisiana. See, he'd never stopped trying to look for that girl in the photo. By pure happenstance, the girl in question, whose name is Beth (Taylor Schilling), runs the kennel and she assumes that Logan has shown up looking for work. And because the plot demands it, Logan rides with the deception.<br /><br />The kennel is this run-down establishment, and Logan quickly makes himself useful, never mind Beth's bitter ex-husband's assertion that he may be a \\"crazy drifter.\\" It shouldn't surprise viewers that THE LUCKY ONE follows the patented Nicholas Sparks formula. The film, lushly romantic and graced with evocative cinematography, reminds me quite a bit, in terms of tone and sheer escapism, of [[ASIN:B00006ZXSI A Walk in the Clouds]]. Of course, it makes more sense for Logan to right away inform Beth of why he's really there. But where would the movie be? Taylor Schilling is sweet and appealing, playing a young single mom raising a child while fending off the unwanted affections of her influential ex-husband (who is this bullying deputy sheriff). Beth nurses her own grief. She's yet to come to terms with her brother's death during the war. Logan's military past upsets her and prejudices her against him. Plus, he seems to be everywhere she's at. It's irritating. We all know where this is going. But Nicholas Sparks, with his sweaty wifebeater shirt and his deep aversion to sunlight, is adept at manipulating his audience.<br /><br />Zac Efron surprises me. It's evident that those HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL pictures are increasingly dimming in the rear view. A friend recommended CHARLIE ST. CLOUD to me a while ago, and I laughed at her with the smug convinction of someone who views Zac Efron as someone who belongs strictly in the teeny bopper crowd. But Efron demonstrates reserve and maturity in his portrayal of a troubled jarhead desperate for solace. He plays Logan as a man of serious humor but with hidden depths. I liked him. Blythe Danner comes in as Schilling's wise grandmother. Danner, naturally, exhibits that infallible knack for sensing the right man for her hurting granddaughter. I long for a grandmother like Danner. It surely would save time and effort on them online dating services.<br /><br />A manly man like me can readily admit that he's a romantic cuss. I enjoyed THE LUCKY ONE quite a bit. Nothing in the story surprised me. I looked each plot swerve (not many) squarely in the eye. But Efron and Schilling invest in their characters, and they effortlessly pull the viewer in. It helps that the little boy is likable. There's a stillness and thoughtfulness to the film which I appreciated. It doesn't indulge in too many grand gestures, although, okay, the climactic sequence is pretty melodramatic. The movie accomplishes that ultimate flattery: It made me want to read the book. Yeah, Nicholas Sparks, in his wifebeater shirt, knows what he's doing. Even if he drinks human blood.dulge in too many grand gestures, although, okay, the climactic sequence is pretty melodramatic.

0205313426|4.0|A surprisingly entertaining as well as useful little book. Good writing is about \\"plainness, simplicity, orderliness, sincerity\\", it says. Writers who seek to follow trends are \\"as good as dead\\", it warns. And the queasy are advised to speak of feeling \\"nauseated\\" not \\"nauseous\\" - unless they're sure they \\"have that effect on others\\". A lot of good advice has been published by writers over the years, Mark Twain, George Orwell and Elmore Leonard among them. For me, this paragraph from The Elements of Style is as good as any of it: \\"Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all sentences short or avoid all detail and treat subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.\\"
B005LZW9CG|3.0|I bought this CD,Thinking,Wow GOLD CD.Gonna get the sound quality that I have been looking for ! (A very long time) Not the case here.... Sound quality is Good.BUT NOT THE SONIC OVERHAUL that this cd truly needs. I guess were gonna have to keep waiting........
B003G4W49C|5.0|Probably the best book I ever read.<br /><br />Very smooth read.  Builds up the characters great.  Big twist at the end which throws the whole viewpoint of things to a different dimension.  Gets you to like (or hate) the characters.<br /><br />If you read the book you definitely will be happy you did!<br /><br />I read the other books after it.  The ones following Ender really disappointed me.  The ones following Bean and the others are much better (like Ender's Shadow).

The characters were lively, complex, and various enough to keep you engaged, but not so various you couldn't keep track of them all.

0195145925|4.0|It is safe to say that time is one of the most perplexing of phenomena to challenge the human mind. No surprise then that it's been the subject of some of the most momentous conjectures and research findings, from Minkowski's time, to Einstein's time dilation and Stephen Hawking's \\"imaginary time\\".<br /><br />Then there is the question of whether time, as an objective property of the cosmos, exists at all. This is the subject taken up in this book, by Julian Barbour.  Barbour himself is somewhat of an enigma as a physicist, not having followed the usual rigorous \\"publish or perish\\" path. Evidently, though \\"doing a Ph.D. on Einstein's theory of gravitation\\" he opted for the path of a Russian scientific literature translator which afforded him the latitude for other pursuits - such as time.<br /><br />Not many physicists would have made such an odd turn, mainly because most of them would have followed the traditional path, as opposed to being language translators. But the odd detour is precisely what put Barbour in the place to write the book he has.<br /><br />Is this a physics text? Perusing the chapters it has the veneer of a physics text as one peruses the assorted 22 chapters plus the Epilogue, though to be sure - several of the chapters (Chapters 2, 4 and especially 7 - `Paths in Platonia' and 17- `The Philosophy of Timelessness' have the look and feel of philosophy.<br /><br />Indeed, reading through many of the other sections to do with special and general relativity (Part Three, Chapters 8-11) echoed earlier issues and topics from Hans Reichenbach's 'The Philosophy of Space and Time' (Dover, 1958).<br /><br />Compare for example, Barbour's Chapter 3 (`A Timeless World') and the section `Is Motion Real?' (p. 46) with Reichenbach's `Unreal Sequences' (p. 147) in which he notes (p. 149):<br /><br />\\"The discussion of unreal sequences shows clearly the significance of the causal theory of time. Only the events in a real causal process are temporally ordered: unreal sequences obtain their time order as a result of some method of time comparison which is already defined within the system.\\"<br /><br />And of course, in Barbour's Chapter 7 (`Paths to Platonia') we see this very modus operandi in terms of defining \\"Machian histories\\" in the context of the distance between any two neighboring points in Platonia- leading to Barbour's Platonian geodesics (pp. 116-1119) and \\"one of the two prime pieces of evidence for suggesting the universe is timeless\\". (The other arising from quantum mechanics, i.e. in its acausal foundations)<br /><br />Not surprisingly, therefore, a hard core reductionist physicist reading this text will not be too impressed and treat it more as philosophy than physics. On the other hand, on reading it I treated it in just this way which is why I awarded it 4 stars.<br /><br />Why the tendency for physicists to dismiss it? Well, mainly because if you remove conventional time (and by extension, motion) from our formalist gestalt you essentially remove the basis for doing most physics- which let's face it, is mainly embodied in differential equations of the form:<br /><br />d(p)/ dt =  m (dv/dt) = ma<br /><br />Thus, if one reads Barbour's text strictly as a physics book, with the expectations of such, one will more likely be disappointed.<br /><br />Never mind that the timeless Zeitgeist isn't as alien as we'd like to believe.<br /><br />For example, G.J. Whittrow, in 'The Nature of Time', (1972, Pelican Books, Great Britain, p. 103), observes:<br /><br />\\"the passage of time is merely to be regarded as a feature of consciousness that has no objective counterpart.\\"<br /><br />And more recently, a special issue of Scientific American on Time (pages 8 and 15), included an article: 'Is Time an Illusion?' by Craig Callender, who observes (p. 16):<br /><br />\\"Many in theoretical physics have come to believe that time fundamentally does not exist\\".<br /><br />His article and one by Paul Davies (p. 8) are definitely worth reading for the temporal objectivists!<br /><br />Other physicists, e.g. Robert Nadeau, Menos Kafatos et al, have correctly observed that since time itself is susceptible to certain formulations of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (e.g. its energy-time presentation) then time itself is uncertain, and if uncertain, no defined units or dimensions can be assigned. This also means time is elastic. It can bend, expand or contract, and even do so under the influence of consciousness. (See, `Conscious Mind in the Physical World', by Euan Squires)<br /><br />Then there is the realm of \\"imaginary time\\" and \\"imaginary space\\". For example, stay where you are and let one minute elapse on your watch. You have performed a 'movement in time' without a corresponding movement in space. We say you have traversed imaginary space. This imaginary space can easily be computed:<br /><br />Im(x) = i(300,000 km/s x 60 s) = 18,000,000(i) km<br /><br />That is, you have traversed 18 million imaginary kilometers or 11.25 million miles in imaginary space. (Im(x) is the symbolic representation for an imaginary space (x) transition).<br /><br />My point in belaboring all this is that there are many different time perspectives, and who is to say which one is absolutely the correct form, or usage? What does `dt' in our differential equations really mean? If objective time or a unit of measure, how truly objective is it? Can we dismiss any hint of elasticity or subjectivity?<br /><br />If one adopts the right mental framework, in other words, there is no reason not to actually enjoy Barbour's book and presentation - if one can admit of a bit more flexibility in time's definitions while doing so!rth reading for the temporal objectivists!<br /><br />Other physicists, e.g. Robert Nadeau, Menos Kafatos et al, have correctly observed that since time itself is susceptible to certain formulations of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (e.g. its energy-time presentation) then time itself is uncertain, and if uncertain, no defined units or dimensions can be assigned.

B006PGL7OQ|4.0|What would you do if you thought that you and your family were in danger of being killed by a deadly storm?<br /><br />Take Shelter shows us a glimpse inside the mind of Curtis (Michael Shannon), who has vivid dreams of an approaching storm. In his dreams, his wife and young daughter are in terrible danger. The film sometimes blurs the line between fantasy and reality and we see events unfold that are later revealed as dreams. His dog bites him in one such event and unidentified strangers attack him and his daughter in another episode.<br /><br />We all have nightmares, but Curtis experiences more than just dreams. He also hears the storm approaching. While he is working outside with his colleague, Dewart (Shea Whigham), Curtis hears a thunderbolt strike. Dewart doesn't hear a thing.<br /><br />Do you trust what you see and hear without question? What would you think if you could hear things that nobody else could?<br /><br />If what Curtis experiences is really happening, how is that possible? Is it some form of intervention from God? It is some kind of psychic ability? Is the subconscious mind revealing what Curtis knows on some level?<br /><br />To complicate matters, Curtis was left alone outside a store as a child when his mother had a mental breakdown and just walked away. He visits her in a nursing home because he fears that he might be going down the same path. It's such a realistic possibility that we are drawn into his world. Is he going crazy? He seems rational most of the time, but then he experiences another dream or hallucination.<br /><br />His wife, Samantha (Jessica Chastain), is more than patient. We get the feeling that their relationship is strong and she clearly loves him. In a good relationship, it should be possible to talk openly about such problems, but Curtis initially hides everything from her. This is done out of fear. He's afraid of what might be happening to him and he's embarrassed about his experiences. He visits a doctor and a psychiatrist without her knowledge and even makes a serious financial decision without discussing it.<br /><br />Lack of communication is a huge problem in most relationships. If you are with the person you are supposed to trust more than anyone in the world, why can't you voice all of your fears? Curtis is eventually compelled to talk to Samantha because there's no other way to explain his bizarre behavior.<br /><br />Take Shelter shows us what occurs in the mind of a tormented man. The tension slowly builds and we can sense that something is going to happen. Is Curtis going crazy, or will all of his actions be justified? I won't reveal that here.<br /><br />The ending is somewhat controversial. I liked it a lot and think it was the perfect way to conclude the story. Shannon does a great job in the final scenes and there's one particular expression which speaks volumes. Unfortunately, I can't talk about it without ruining things.<br /><br />The film only cost around $1 million to make, but it achieves more than many big-budget productions. The story felt real to me and I could easily empathize with everything Curtis went through. The two hours went by fast and the tension was incredible.atrist without her knowledge and even makes a serious financial decision without discussing it.<br /><br />Lack of communication is a huge problem in most relationships.

M-theory predicts the universe can come from nothing. huh?....The rest of the book is like a high school term paper summarizing some cool cosmological topics. I find it hard to believe Steven Hawking had anything to do with this book. The \\"balloon\\" metaphor for the expanding universe?  Big disappointment. I would have given ZERO stars if possible. But then, according to the authors, stars would have been created out of nothing anyway...
B00637TV1I|5.0|I had to buy this (CD) after stumbling across this band on LiveFM, and buying all 3 of their EPs. This certainly does not disappoint! I would agree with the previous reviews (and I'm not much of a reviewer anyway :)<br /><br />The only downside that I can tell is the recording quality is still a bit odd (but consistent with the EPs. Also, there is about a 1-2 second gap between a few of the tracks (which were meant to flow into one another). Maybe I just got a bad CD?  I can probably fix these in Audacity.<br /><br />These minor nits are not nearly enough to impact my enjoyment of the Jezebels. They are an incredibly fresh band, and things seem to just be getting better as far as the material with each release!<br /><br />EDIT: Not sure why this says it is from an MP3 download, as I bought the CD...

B00511ONPG|5.0|I can't say enough about this one. I was a newbie to social media and decided to get this book because of a suggestion by Amazon (love that!). I read the book and absolutely LOVED it because of how caring Dave is about what he believes in: helping businesses and end users maximize the potential of social networking the right way. Yes, it does talk about Facebook but you can easily apply the information to anything off/online. That's the diamond factor for me. I also \\"followed\\" Dave on Twitter and he responded like I knew he would. He is out there and unafraid. Are you? Arm yourself with the tools you need to succeed in this new binary jungle of Internet marketing. You won't regret a word in this book. Go for it! I did :) Dave Kerpen is literally changing my life daily! This is a book you'll want to keep handy and refer to often. It's priceless to me ;)

B006CS7UXO|4.0|PSB's second B-side compilation is very good, obviously, though not quite as good as Alternative.  The biggest difference to me is that the element of discovery is absent here.  When I bought Alternative in 1995, nearly every track was new for me.  Those B-sides would have been very difficult to find in the pre-commercial internet age, especially in the United States.  You would have spent an enormous amount of time and money ordering import singles.  So Alternative was just a godsend for PSB fanatics; we were offered two whole discs of songs that many people probably didn't know existed.<br /><br />But Format covers a different era.  I think most PSB fans will already know many if not most of the tracks here.  There were only a few that I hadn't heard.  With Bilingual in 1996, PSB started a policy of two-disc releases for all new albums that included associated B-sides and remixes on the second disc.  Those versions were limited-run, but they were widely available in the US.  Certainly not every track on Format was available on a double-CD release, but many were.  On the other hand, it's great to have all these tracks in one collection.<br /><br />Anyway, the music here is mostly great.  PSB were quick to point out on Alternative that not every track was good; there were some truly bad songs there, as there are here.  But the good-to-bad ratio is high and approximately equal to that album.  And like Alternative, the great thing about these tracks is that PSB experimented and stretched out.  The best tracks here come from the later years.  My favourites in no order:<br /><br />- How I Learned to Hate Rock & Roll<br />- The Boy Who Couldn't Keep His Clothes On<br />- The View From Your Balcony (one of their all-time best B-sides)<br />- Silver Age<br />- Always (a truly great track; seems to be one of NT's favourites too)<br />- Nightlife (great outtake from that album)<br />- Between Two Islands<br />- We're the Pet Shop Boys (ironically a cover)<br />- Transparent(energetic tech-house)<br />- The Resurrectionist<br />- Girls Don't Cry<br />- Gin and Jag (PSB's ode to aging. Favourite line: \\"Be careful with the decanter, dear.  Do you know how much it's worth?\\")<br />- After the Event (the lyrics are so great and so PSB)<br />- Up and Down<br /><br />Ultimately, PSB fans are quite blessed.  PSB are just a machine that cranks out an endless supply of great new pop songs.  There's a lot of music to work through here, and it really allows the listener a good idea the breadth and quality of music that PSB are capable of.

It will touch you on many levels. Mostly the levels you have suppressed during your lifetime. It makes you more aware and shows you a method to reduce and eliminate your fears....all self imposed, I may add. We are totally responsible for everything that is in our world and the scapegoats we use to the contrary, should be eliminated. We have only to become aware of our own magesty to start really living the beautiful life we're ignoring. I have told so many people about this book and even presented a few as gifts, because it is a must read and it can change your life in only the best way possible.

0393338827|5.0|Michael Lewis has written another masterpiece, combining financial history and machinations with intriguing characters. I read this without putting it down and irritated my girlfriend endlessly. I have been close enough to Wall Street insiders to question their honesty, intelligence, and motivation, but this book really puts it in perspective. The asset backed securities markets was gamed to fool investors and hide details from regulators. It would have been better to send people to jail than provide a bailout, but I guess some really are too big to fail.<br /><br />Investors were insuring mortgage bonds without any idea of equity positions, silent second mortgages, interest rate time bombs, or mortgagee creditworthiness. Sellers said the loss probability was 8% but it turned out to be 40% in some cases. Lewis tells the story of a handful of weirdos who had this figured out, some of whom still managed to end up losing. It took a while for our protagonists to figure out how to make money on this bet once they had determined that the house odds were all wrong. Eventually they introduced bond insurance products which were a better investment than a mixed bag of long and short bonds.  Going long and short does not work when all the bonds are toxic, as some Wall Streeters are still thinking about in their palatial retirement homes.<br /><br />What distinguishes Lewis from all the other chroniclers of this era is his ability to find interesting characters at the center of the story and tell it from their perspective. Here we have a depressed, loner, finally diagnosed with Asperberger's syndrome who saw it all coming from a bunker, and had to resort to questionable tactics to keep his investors in line until the bet paid off. Lewis also understands finance from his 1980's time on Wall Street and can explain financial instruments to the delight of those like me with Finance degrees.

The only one I liked better was The West Wing... the greatest show of all time, I think.<br /><br />I'll never forget House and his humor. Weird humor but truly funny.

B005NPLXJ4|1.0|I applaud artists that step outside their comfort zone and try to push themselves in new directions.  For example, Wilco has tried (and sometimes failed) to do quite a few different types of albums.  The Flaming Lips are just doing nothing new or interesting and haven't since 1999.  So I end up respecting Wilco more than the Flaming Lips.<br />Here we get an interesting idea: the dude from the Velvet Underground, one of the most influential guys in rock history, and we hear him teamed up with a solid metal outfit.  They know better than to record something that sounds like ProTools.  They have this cool idea to take the old Louise Brooks film that film geeks love and use that as inspiration.  A professional approach to the songs so they'd sound well-crafted, almost inspired by Shellac?  Yeah, that too!<br />But sometimes great ideas just don't work out, like four wheel steering in cars or TV shows about hot airline stewardesses.  You gotta wonder why everyone involved didn't listen back to the demos and have the courage to say, \\"Hey, guys, we have this great idea, but it's more liquid than aspic.  Whadda ya say we shelve this one?  People will say, 'I heard Lou Reed recorded some stuff with Metallica...I'd die to get my hands on those recordings?' and the mystery will be greater than the released product.  If we release this, people will question our integrity, make Hitler parody videos about us, and then we'll be backpedaling in interviews until our next releases. Let's shake hands and go our separate ways for now.\\"
B005LAIGSM|2.0|I was looking forward to this movie, because when I read the premise, it held a lot of promise- however it was just very average. There is little intensity in this, it's just sort of bland. I didn't find it to be engaging, there's nothing that grips or hooks the viewer. I didn't care about any of the characters. The ending is also anti-climatic. Overall, if you're in the mood for an average movie, then this is the movie for you. I found it forgettable.
0375413405|5.0|Julia Child definitely mastered the art of French cooking. After living in France and loving the food, this book has helped me cope with being so far away. I have a lot of favorite French-authored cookbooks, but I enjoy this one because of the little tweaks that make it easier to do in an American kitchen.<br /><br />Until reading this book, I had never clarified butter...I had never dried the meat before browning it...and I had never prepped a pan with olive oil, carrots, and onion before adding other ingredients, which adds a huge increase in flavor.<br /><br />I recommend that everyone purchase this book...for both nostalgic and practical reasons.  Read it like a book, cover-to-cover...you'll learn a lot!

1455508977|4.0|The Lucky One by Nicholas Sparks is 38 chapters and an epilogue about an ex-marine, Logan Thibault, who is deemed the lucky one by his friends. His best friend Victor tells him the picture he finds will bring him good luck, and so he carries a picture of an unknown woman around in his pocket during his time in Iraq. When his tour is up, he walks from Colorado to Hampton, North Carolina, to find this unknown woman. This part didn't ring true, as I thought he'd take a plane or at least a train, since he obviously has waited so long to find her. It reminded me of The Walk. With the publication of The Notebook, I became a fan and love his writing style, but I didn't find this novel equal to The Notebook.<br />Elizabeth, called Beth by everyone but her dead brother and Logan, is Nana's granddaughter, an elementary schoolteacher, and the woman Logan is out to find. Logan stumbles upon a job at a dog kennel owned by Nana as he searches for the woman. Sparks did an excellent job with Nana's character, and she was my favorite one. She brought humor to the story which reminded me of the mother in a novel I wrote. It didn't bother me that he used clich&eacute;s in dialogue because that's the way many people speak, though I saw a reviewer didn't like it. I love books that use them appropriately in dialogue to bring out the true character and the way people actually speak, as a character in one of my own novels. One of the most touching parts was the boating scene with his friend Victor. The ending scene could have been better, but felt rushed and lacked the emotion of the boating scene. Sparks needed to show us what happened to Thibault and Clayton. Show, don't tell when it comes to major action and scenes. It would have made for a much stronger ending, but overall I enjoyed the story and felt he did a good job. Flashbacks don't bother me either, as I saw they did another reviewer. I used them in one of my novels, the one with the mother and her clich&eacute;s. Such clich&eacute;s create memorable characters. I could just visualize Nana.<br />Through the foreshadowing, one can predict the ending easily. The difference with my novel is my foreshadowing doesn't give away the ending. I love Sparks novels and will continue to read him, but I don't know if he'll ever write an equal to The Notebook in my eyes.le characters.

B006OAB3ME|4.0|It's become one of those perennial pop star indulgences - doing an album of old standards.  Harry Nilsson set the bar very high with [[ASIN:B000EQ47WM A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night]], which has become a classic in its own right.  Since then, dozens of others have put on an old hat or a loose tie, stood in front of a microphone that Frank Sinatra once used, with arrangements that just scream, \\"Yo, I got me a big band!\\" and hoped that the history in the room would do the rest.  The albums that resulted are as much acting as singing, and not always good acting - a vanity piece dressed up as a tribute.<br /><br />Thankfully, this is not another album from a rock star playing dress up and giving us his versions (or even worse, \\"reinterpretations\\") of It Had to be You and I've Got You Under My Skin.  Paul McCartney is old enough to remember the days before rock and roll and most of the selections here reflect the music that was played in his home as he grew up rather than just dipping into the songbooks of Porter, Gershwin and Berlin.  This explains the choice of less widely known songs such as My Very Good Friend the Milkman.  I strongly suspect the Beatles' shared love of The Goon Show informed some of these selections.<br /><br />McCartney avoids another standards-album cliché, and that is to pick a song in every imaginable style within the genre.  Instead, backed by Diana Krall and her band, he picks a vibe and sticks to it - and that vibe is most definitely lounge-bar-at-closing-time.  This is not an album intended for daylight hours.  The two new McCartney songs fit in seamlessly and unless you already know all the covers, you'd probably have a hard time picking them out.  My Valentine in particular has a beautiful melancholy about it.<br /><br />One could never accuse Paul McCartney of lacking versatility.  His previous album was a [[ASIN:B005H1IQ6M classical ballet]] and the one before that was an album of [[ASIN:B001GKYBXA ambient electronica]].  What this album focuses on is McCartney, the singer.  For the first time in a 50-year career, apart from a bit of acoustic guitar, Paul does nothing but sing.  Indeed, on some of the songs, he almost whispers rather than sing.  Again, if you didn't already know this was Paul McCartney, you might not immediately recognise his voice.<br /><br />If I have a criticism, it's that the flow of the record seems to get lost about three quarters of the way through.  Rather than concluding, it just sort of fizzles out.  The two extra tracks on the \\"deluxe\\" edition (why do they do this??) don't help this.<br /><br />There are those who want Paul McCartney to just keep belting out Get Back and Hey Jude for the rest of his life and this album will not please them.  If you think music began in 1964, just admit that this isn't your bag and wait for the next album.  As rock star indulgences go though, this is a pretty good one and a better than average example of the standards album.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|Okay so simply put this headset is worth the money despite some of the negative reviews on it, I have had my headset for a while now and to be honest i was a bit put off at first due to some bad reviews about it, firstly i have never had a single issue with humming or buzzing regardless of where i places the transmitter, i have also never had an issue with it being uncomfortable or \\"hurting\\" my ears and i wear this thing for hours on end, i have also seem complaints that it is \\"heavy\\" which simply is not true i mean compared to a wired headset it maybe slightly heavier but not enough to where you would notice it.<br /><br />Now for my review, i have owned a few pairs of turtle beach headsets, turtle beach x1's which were fantastic in my opinion, i still have them and they work great and ive had them for 3 years, but the talk back cable broke so i had to buy a new pair. I got the px21's, terrible mistake my first pair broke after 6 months, so i got a second pair and those broke after only 3, terrible headset to buy. So i replaced them with the x41's, mainly because i was looking for a good reliable wireless headset, and i got exactly what i payed for. The sound quality is amazing, the 7.1 dolby surround sound makes everything so crisp and sharp and the ability to change between surround sound and regular stereo is nice especially if you want to switch from a game to a movie. The headset itself is very sturdy and feels durable, but is also very comfortable to wear, i have actually forgotten i was wearing them a couple times, the only thing about this headset i can complain about is the batteries the headset will last about 2 days on a single pair on heavy use through a day, but to be honest i feel that is a lot better then having to deal with a cord that is always in your way. I just got my headset with a pair of rechargeable AAA's and this has work well so far.<br /><br />So dont be put off by negative reviews, this headset is well worth the money especially if you want a good wireless headset with great sound quality

I can honestly say this is on the very top of my favorites list.

0345803485|1.0|My book club (may become my former book club) chose this Harlequiness romance for our May selection.  While not excited about reading it after hearing a description of the plot line, I thought I'd take a risk and download the book.  This book has brought much humor into my life with lines like \\"My limbs are deliciously heavy, sated. My inner goddess has a DO NOT DISTURB sign on the outside of her room\\". I've taken to reading some of the 'better' dialogue to my co-worker just so she appreciates what a modern best-seller is made of. The plot is so weak, predictable and completely unrealistic that I'm surprised an editor even let it see the light of day.  This story would barely garner a C in an 8th grade English class.  The word \\"jeez\\" is the go to word whenever our Ms. Steele can't think what to say.  An she's not the only one who defaults to such juvenile exclamations, with her mom being absolutely amazed at a piece of advanced technological equipment - a Mac given to Ms. Steele by her dom boyfriend. Please. The only slightly amusing writing in the book are the email exchanges between Mr. Grey and Ms. Steele.  These are way to few to make the book worth picking up however.  So, if you need a good laugh, or need an example of how not to write, this is the book for you.  Otherwise, don't be tempted by the best seller status of this drivel of a novel.

Best ever front row seats with every detail and sound is provided for those with the quality systems to present this show at its best.  The only way to top this was to be there ... and to have had front row seats.  Highlight has to be be Masquerade.  Those brilliant costumes in detail and colour seen on a quality big screen are just amazing.  My partner and I have seen it all, live show, movie, other DVD shows but within minutes of loading this 25Th show into the Blu-Ray player we just stopped everything and were captivated.

0345803485|1.0|Where to begin?? I'd heard mixed reviews about this book, but as it finally knocked Hunger Games off the top spot on the NY Times best seller list, I figured it might be time to actually give the book a shot. Boy I wish I hadn't. It was poorly written, the characters were so undeveloped you didn't care what happened to them, and even though this was supposed to be some sort of erotica there was nothing erotic about it. Quite frankly it was so tedious and unimaginative it was laughable.<br /><br />Those who've said this book is basically a rewrite of Twilight, only with sex and character name changes, are absolutely right. However, you'd think they would have done a better job with the writing this go-round. Like Bella, Ana is clumsy, has a mother who has multiple marriages and lives across the country, has a father who is stoic, she has never been interested in a guy until Edward...whoops, I mean Christian, and she would do whatever he wants, even if it goes against what she wants and believes. Edward/Christian are basically the same person, only in Shades, he's allowed to play the BDSM card (and very poorly at that) and insist she call him \\"sir\\".<br /><br />Ana's inner monologue (that whole inner goddess tedium) is overused and over-the-top annoying. It cheers her on whenever Christian wants to \\"beat\\" her, even though she's made it clear she's afraid of him. Ana and Christian's interaction and relationship comes across more as domestic abuse than a consensual dominant/subservient one, with her inner goddess urging on these unwanted beatings.<br /><br />And I'm sorry, but am I really supposed to believe a recent college graduate, in the year 2011, didn't have a bloody email address until Christian bought her a computer for her to do research on 'the lifestyle'?? If the author hadn't already lost my attention with the mind-numbing dialogue between Ana and Christian, which was so awkward, it was cringe-worthy, she would have there.<br /><br />Run, do not walk, away from this rubbish.
0439023483|5.0|This book truly was captivating. I personally am not the type of person that sits down to read a book. Or at least I wasn't prior to opening The Hunger Games. From the end of the first chapter I was hooked, my imagination moving a mile a minute picturing scene after scene just as one would picture a movie. This book is honestly a good read for men and women of all ages. I fully recommend it, and as a result of the hook at the end, I am currently onto the next one. Read this book... you won't regret it!!!
B0074EIQQU|3.0|I've been a fan of TMV ever since \\"Deloused\\" and I've enjoyed the subtle changes (and returns to form) along the way. After enduring an abnormally extended hiatus (for TMV), I was looking forward to a new release. Sadly, I was disappointed with the aptly named \\"noctourniquet\\".<br /><br />For the most part, the songs seem lifeless and uninteresting, each only slightly discernible from the next. The sole high point (for me) is \\"molochwalker\\", which harkens to TMV of old, complete with Juan's blistering bass work. The rest just sort of languidly oozes along, providing little of the intrigue or intensity which marked such outstanding releases as \\"Deloused in the Comatorium\\", \\"Frances The Mute\\" or \\"The Bedlam in Goliath\\".<br /><br />If I were to point to one intangible quality that this CD lacks, it would be the characteristic \\"punch\\" which punctuated all previous releases (even the sub-par \\"Amputechture\\"). Whether this is due to songwriting, production value or the fact that Juan's punchy lines are frequently buried on this recording (an absolute crime in and of itself), the fact remains that the feeling of having been punched squarely in the chest is sorely lacking on this effort.<br /><br />Change can be great - I love hearing bands mature and evolve, except when it seems they are doing so for the sake of change alone. Time to take a step or two backward, Omar. The \\"sweet spot\\" exists behind you.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|About the Book:<br />Ana Steele has never really found herself to be attracted to anyone before. At least, not in that head over heels, butterflies in the stomach type way. Not until she meets Christian Grey, and what's not to like? He's gorgeous beyond belief, extremely wealthy, and (as Ana soon finds out) excellent in bed. Of course, there is always the saying, \\"It's probably too good to be true.\\" Well, Christian Grey is no exception. Although Christian Grey causes Ana's heart to catch in her throat, she's not sure if she can handle the arrangement he desires: a Dominant/submissive relationship ... with Ana as the sub!<br /><br />Review:<br />I was introduced to this by a friend who has a fascination for reading BDSM books to see how bad (or good) and accurate they are. We both agreed that this was a very lack luster book. It had potential. It really did, but it should have stayed where it started - as a fan fiction. Now, don't get me wrong. There are some fan fictions out there that are written very well. However, Fifty Shades of Grey (originally Master of the Universe) is not one of them.<br /><br />Honestly, I cannot see why this is such a huge hit. The sex scenes are subpar, the characters annoying and bland, and the writing is on the same level as Twilight. Speaking of the writing, dear gods was it repetitive. I lost count of how many times Ana bit her lip, rolled her eyes, or thought, \\"Oh my.\\" Add the massive amount of text devoted to how Christian's eyes are grey and Ana's constant chattering of her subconscious and \\"inner goddess,\\" and you have a very long and dull book. Not only was the text very repetitive, but the storyline was literally nothing more than Ana and Christian and the hormones in between them. Again, there are several books, which purely focus on a relationship between two characters, that manage to be quite intriguing. Fifty Shades is not one of them. What's worse is that this is only part one of three, and these aren't short 200 or so page books. Nope. Fifty Shades of Grey is a whopping 529 pages. Yes, we have over five hundred pages of little more than, \\"I don't really like being a sub, but I 'love' him.\\" The sad part is that Ana's internal issues could be quite the hook, but we are led over the same lines throughout the novel, which created a very boring read.<br /><br />It was more than likely this minimal insight that led to such flat characters. Granted, the main character was originally Bella Swan so it's not surprising that Ana fell short of a fully developed and likeable character. Then, since Ana was originally Bella, we get to witness some of her .. er ... exceptional qualities such as her absurd clumsiness and virginal attitude. Still, I have to give James some credit. She, at least, had her main character get up and do something. Next, we have have Edward Cullen... I mean, Christian Grey. Okay, to be honest, I can barely remember anything about these demmed characters, which ought to tell more than words alone. All I can really recall is that Ana was irksome, her friend even more so, and Christian was your perfect git. Oh, I also remember that Christian and Ana really need to work on their jealousy issues.<br /><br />Now, let's get to the part that most of the fans were raving about: the sex. I've read many negative reviews that claimed it was some of the worst sex ever written. I wouldn't go that far. In fact, I kinda liked the first scene. No, it didn't get me hot and heavy, but I highly appreciated that James focused on more than just the \\"sexy\\" body parts. Hell, I give her kudos for that. However, it still failed to give me that special tingly feeling so E.L. James didn't quite get the gold star. Granted, I had strong issues with the characters and could not get behind them (no pun intended) so that more than likely coloured my view a bit. However, even if these scenes didn't get a rise out of me, I was very pleased to see that James was promoting safety. She has Christian using condoms, which is something you don't often see. James also showed a good insight into the BDSM world. She ends up showing that even though there is power play, both parties give consent in all forms of play. She also shows how important communication is in such sexual aspects and even goes into safe words.<br /><br />All in all though, this book had great potential, but the writing and characters made it short of something enjoyable. Not even the sex made up for the lack luster plot. Yes, it is better than Twilight, but that's not saying much. It may have been okay for fan fiction, but as a published novel ... well, save your time and money.

In any case, he's amazing, and many athletes think he is all the more amazing because he does all of this on a vegan diet. I admit to being intrigued about a vegan diet, and for anyone considering such a lifestyle change I found the book helpful. It's dotted with recipes, and I really like Scott's attitude--it's not holier-than-thou at all. He merely emphasizes that the three most common causes of death in the Western world are all diet and lifestyle related.<br /><br />You wouldn't think someone who can run 165 miles at a stretch would be relatable, but he is! He's smart and funny and thoughtful and sometimes he seems like anyone else, if they happened to be running ridiculous distances. At one point during a race he's so miserable he starts looking for a sidewinder, figuring if he gets bit he can quit without guilt. I can totally relate to that! I have had similar thoughts--if I get eaten by this bear I won't have to climb this God-forsaken hill. I'm sure others have as well.<br /><br />Very entertaining, and for the casual runner, like me, very inspiring. I don't think I'll go vegan--I like dairy and eggs a LOT--but I am putting some more thought into what I eat and eating more veggies and fruits, and I think Scott would approve.
B004LWZW8S|5.0|First of all please get rid of all your expectations! This is not \\"300\\" or \\"Thor\\", or Greek Mythology 101! This is definitely not \\"Clash of the Titans\\"! Much, much better! Tarsem Singh is a visionary genius, that alone should get you interested. If you have never seen \\"The Cell\\" or \\"The Fall, check them out too. With \\"Immortals\\" Tarsem has created a truly beautiful film using elements of the Theseus myth. It is a work of art first and foremost. Fantastic cast. Henry Cavill is genius casting as Theseus. If you are familiar with his Charles Brandon in \\"The Tudors\\" you will be amazed at his transformation into the quintessential Greek warrior. Frieda Pinto is gorgeous. Mickey Rourke, usually not one of my favorite actors, even he is believable as Theseus nemisis Hyperion. John Hurt, Stephen Dorff, Luke Evans, Isabel Lucas, Kellan Lutz. Beautiful CGI cinematography. Brilliant costume design. Lots of buff bodies. Great fight choreography, including two of the best fight scenes I have ever seen. There is blood but you have to expect that in the context. I am puzzled by some of the bad reviews this film has receive. Several reviewers have put it on their top movies of 2011. All I can say is, in my opinion, this was was one of the best all round enjoyable movies to come along in quite awhile. When I first saw it on cable pay per view I was so blown away that I watched it several more times and then went right out and bought the Blu-ray with the digital copy. I am still kicking myself for not seeing it in the theater with 3D!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love it,  I really enjoy this app.  Its my favorite.  When I have spare time it relaxes me. Great job!
B000YRY8BG|5.0|One of the best series I have ever watched. If I could I would give it more than 5 stars. I discovered State of Play quite by accident when checking out James MacAvoy's filmography. John Simm was totally unknown to me and was great in the lead role. David Morissey, Bill Nighy, Kelly MacDonald, Polly Walker, and of course, James MacAvoy filled out the main cast. I was immediately drawn into the story and couldn't wait for each installment. I then made the mistake of watching the movie with Ben Affleck and Russell Crowe, for comparison. I love Ben and Russell, but it was so disappointing, even though by then I was in on the twists in the plot, the original story was so much better than the one they ended up with in the movie. Sometimes you just cannot get the same results from a story without taking some time to let the plot and characters develop. This is a case in point. Highly recommend even for those who are not James MacAvoy fans, and for those who are, definitely a must see.
B006M4F67A|4.0|It's great. More tile and background options would be nice. Other than that it's good. I do enjoy all the different layouts!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|so amazing like army of darkness. but it is so much better&iexcl;!!!!!!<br /> it might need a bit more items innthe store. and have more upgrades till glue upgrades. but still awesome
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|So extremely happy that Draw Something is finally available for my Kindle Fire!! Great game and works so well on the KF!
B006Z1XY7E|5.0|This collection of music by Indie musician Gotye (Wally DeBacker) is as versatile as it gets. It contains something that everyone is likely to enjoy. The use of various instruments and sounds mix together like a fancy soup - spicey, sweet, savory. If you're tired of the ordinary pop and rock and, like myself, have found yourself yearning for music you can really immerse yourself in, give it a listen!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|this game is confusing yet fun thee are puzzle levels and different isles to play on it is so kool!!!!!! u will love it to!!!
0743487486|5.0|I admit that I've only been reading this book for about a week and I've only made it to chapter 6, so I have a ways to go, but already it has fundamentally changed my parenting style.  I'm fighting with my 21-month-old son less, communicating with him more, and I'm very much enjoying spending time with him more.  I feel a lot less stressed that I need to be constantly making sure that he always listens to what I say for fear that he will grow up to never listen to me. After reading this, I'm rather appalled that I ever thought this way, but I have always been taught that if you don't train your kids when they are young, you will have no control once they are teenagers. The feeling of relief alone makes this purchase invaluable not to mention the fact that he listens to me so much better now.  I will post more once I finish reading, I'm just so impressed that I wanted to share now.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game has lots of games with different themes and he more u win the more u can unlock!!! Im sure u will love it
B006OOHYIC|5.0|once you start play it is hard to put it down. I suggest you play the first quell and if you like it you will love this one.
B000ZMVAXO|5.0|This is the best tool for practicing!! the sound quality is better than i thought it was going to be. If you like the sounds of Metallica, White Zombie, and Slayer, just to name a few. this thing has a really tight and heavy crunch. You won't be disappointed!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|this is the most disgusting and horrible book i have ever read in my entire freaking life!!!!!!!!!<br />okay here are some points,<br />1. if you love romance, do not i repeat do not buy or even get a sample of this book.<br />yhe beginning seems alright but when anastasia meets christian is where the stupid porn comes in.<br />2. if you are looking for a light or good read, this is not it!!!!<br />it gives you( well me) a bad feeling in your gut<br />3. most important point,<br />not for kids uner 15 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />i mean it, protect your childs innocance and dont let them read this book ever!!!!!<br />please listen to me, its not worth it<br />i still cant get the words out of my head!!!<br />please
B00127RAJY|5.0|I would highly recommend this video for those looking to tone and slim but who don't want to spend too much time working out. Each workout is only 25 minutes and it is broken down into three circuits, plus a warm up and cool down. In each circuit 3 minutes are dedicated to strength training, 2 minutes to cardio, and 1 minute to abdominal work. This format makes it easy for quitters like me to push through a hard work-out since I know whatever I'm having trouble with will be over soon. The three different workouts keep things interesting and pack a punch. The only improvement would be an extended cool down period -- I often need to stretch more afterwards.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This book starts off with a slow pace.  Delightful to read but slow.  The pace goes from slow to slow and back again.  The ending of the book has a lot of surprises which are slowly revealed.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Makes me feel like I'm back in elementary school.  I always loved to play this game in the library.  Now I need to get the original game.  Fun&hellip;
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|I love this CD!  I purchased it the day it came out and am SO in love!!  Not just with the hit Drive By, but by the title song, California 37, and others.  The songs are real sing alongs and I'm looking forward to seeing them live in July!
B003JTHESA|5.0|The latest studio offering from Iron Maiden is sure to please long time listeners and new fans as well! Solid lyrics, arrangements, and playing from the Gods of metal!
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Without a doubt, Wrecking Ball is the most confrontational album that Bruce Springsteen has done to date.  To me, it is music for our times, tapping into the anger that exists in America today. The lyrics are angry and point a finger at politicians and profiteers.  Songs like \\"Jack of All Trades\\" reflects on all of the stories in the news of the new working class in the aftermath of the Great Recession.  The mood is tired, broken but not defeated.  The economic crisis also comes through in \\"Death to My Hometown\\" where Wall Street rubs up against an ineffectual Congress. The Irish influenced music is a rallying cry to rise up and fight back.  \\"This Depression\\" provides a contrast to the anger of many of the songs in the need for love in a time of trouble.<br /><br />Not everything is entirely grim. \\"Land of Hope and Dreams,\\" originally released in 2001 is included on the disc gives a strong voice that things will be all right once again.  The brief saxophone solo by Clarence Clemons is a parting call from the past when things were much better, and will be again.  The special edition also includes two bonus tracks Swallowed Up and American Land. They provide a nice summing up of the album.<br /><br />Wrecking Ball is a powerful summing up of the America of today.  Springsteen gives voice to all of our hopes, fears and realities - what was lost and what people had to do to get on with life.  Maybe his message is one that some feel is misplaced but there is no denying that he has given us the feel of what it is like to be an American in the 21st century.  I agree with fellow reviewer George Whilhite that Springsteen is the John Steinbeck of rock.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I had zero problems with reception and can walk around my apartment fine and still hear music vent games etc . The sound quality is a steal for 100 bucks (atm its priced at 100)
B0018LX9T4|5.0|This film is quirky,  bent and sizzlingly electric, and geared to the open minded viewer.<br />It explores the threshold of pain, pleasure and passion in relationships but it's actually a old fashioned die-hard romance in disguise.<br />This Lionsgate Indie is actually a very clever satire about two tweaked people, one a lawyer and the other a troubled woman who comes to work at his law office. Their obsessive interaction is daring, super charged and mind bendingly erotic. It pushes all those primal buttons to the floor and beyond.<br />The acting is absolutely remarkable in this psychological character study. It's much more stylishly sexy instead of sleazy, considering its edgy subject matter.<br />Irresistable... strange... fabulous... steamy and sensual.
B000G8NXYQ|5.0|Often funny, wildly bizarre and consistently entertaining, this film will appeal to those with an open mind and a taste for the absurd.  Adolescence and sexuality have rarely been captured with such vulgarity, respect and insight.<br /><br />Being largely ignorant of Italian history and culture, the DVD commentary was absolutely essential for a deeper understanding and appreciation of this film.  I say this not to discourage but to entice.  The DVD commentary is simply brilliant, providing incredibly poignant and concise context for scenes that, while superficially entertaining, are actually embedded with symbolism and intelligence.<br /><br />If you are willing to invest some time into this film, you won't be disappointed.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|remember the old game mixed with modern day of games on facebook better thanthe old floppy disk game of Oregon trail
B000002B2T|5.0|I'll be honest, the first time I heard this album I didn't like it at all, but the more times I listened to it the more it grew on me and the more I got from it. This is an amazing album that is definetely not going to be for everyone, including AIC and Pearl Jam fans. It's much more mellow and bluesy/jazzy, a prime example being \\"Artificial Red\\", but there are some all out rockers such as \\"I Don't Know Anything\\" and one of my favorite intrumentals, \\"November Hotel.\\" Layne Staley is of course nothing short of amazing on all of these songs and musically it's fantastic! So if your a fan of AIC and Pearl Jam I strongly urge you to check this album out, just be warned it's nothing like either band. This is a one of a kind masterpiece album!!!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|for the person that said something about giving your information it asks you for you email address not the password!Your are supposed to put in your User name so if you want to play with friends they just look it up.DUH!!!!!!! Wow u r stupid!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|So glad to finally have this on the Kindle Fire!<br />Can't wait to play on a bigger screen.<br />: )
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I've been using this for a few months now and I love it. It is good for writing short stories, poems, notes, to do lists, and so much more! ilIt even allows you to set it to notify you about upcoming events. I recommend this to everyone!
B004UID2LC|5.0|I don't have it let bug don't jugde a book by its cover right?just get it if u don't like delete
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Very good field knife sharpener.  It is smaller than I expected but that does not take away from what this sharpener can do.  Works extremely well and I am very satisfied with the purchase.
B0072NWKEC|5.0|Okay, despite being an inveterate reader, I had somehow overlooked Philip Kerr. Luckily, the New York Times recently reviewed \\"Prague Fatale\\" favorably, so I took a chance on it. Wow. Just wow.<br /><br />Dense, beautifully written, wickedly smart, great dialog and scattered here and there literary references that fly by so fast one almost misses registering them. A moral guy in an immoral and evil universe, Bernie Gunther walks close to the edge always and somehow manages to not fall off. Let's resurrect Bogart and Bacall to star in this one!<br /><br />I won't recap the story - others seem to be doing that, the spoilers! - but I will say that the book is set mostly in Berlin in the run-up to World War II. Since I lived in Berlin for a few years in the mid-60s, I recognized the city and its landmarks absolutely. Kerr has not only done his research (see his afterword), but obviously spent time on the scene as well.<br /><br />I'm into \\"Field Gray\\" now. The war's over and Bernie's still in trouble. Dang, I'm going to have to do something like I did with Elmore Leonard ... read all of Philip Kerr's books in the order he wrote them. I can think of worse things to do.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is awesome. I recommend that you play this game. it is a lot like zoo tycoon. or poke farm villein on facebook. I have not played a game this cool in a while... awesome cool
B001F4UHFI|5.0|A perfect vehicle for Cage. Other actors were excellent.  A good, witty, action-filled story without the usual cliches. People who did not like it are probably car-chase nuts and want more gore and sex.  This is a smart movie...one of my top 100 of all time.
0345803485|5.0|This is a must read for anyone who needs to escape to a fantasy world. As a mom of two with a full time job and no time to read, I found myself reading this book every second I had, even at stop lights! I am on to the second of the trilogy and the story line gets even better!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is completely addicting! I absolutely love it. And I like that you don't have to buy anything to play.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Wish right mouse clicks were done by a double finger tap instead of one finger push and hold, but everything else works great. Connects quickly, several setting options, no connection issues.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so awesome I play it everyday after school<br />and I am going to keep on doing that
B006Z21ZEW|5.0|I`ve been at this concert, great album from the best band of the world, all the songs sound really great a great live performance
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its just like mario and leuige but its a lepercon its soooo much fun on the kindle fire!!!!!!!!  :) :)  :) :)
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It took me forever to finish this book, which is sad because it wasn't that long of a novel. I did like the Hungergames, but I feel like that was the best book in this trilogy. I wasn't expecting this type of ending, I don't know what I was expecting but this was a different twist. The story was good although I'm not crazed over it as most people seem to be, mostly I just think that it was overall just ok, and I just got to the point where I just wanted to finish the story. I won't go into detail because there are tons of far better reviews out there but pretty much its a good read, I just don't think it's as exceptional as most people do.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book was good. The writing could have been improved upon but all in all I still finished this book in 4 days. The Second was much better and I finished it in 2 days. The 3rd is a bit slower but I am still reading it quick. If I could do it again, I would still read the books but wait till I found them in the library or used, $9.99 was a bit more than I thought the books were worth.
