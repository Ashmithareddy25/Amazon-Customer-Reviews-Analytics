B009XIXVU6|4.0|Wonderful book. Grabs you in the beginning and never let's go. It was recommended to me by a friend ... Guess I owe her a Big thank you!
B00005QB42|5.0|I love it !!! Great selection of ethnic chants, beautifully done. Absolutely no criticisms . I could't find the slightest fault.
B0007VZ91C|2.0|Beautiful music, but too fluffy  for me . For diffuse background sound , or to relax before sleep, this would be good for me for those purposes . But i can't actually listen to it .
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|Yes, Patricia Cornwell has done it again!The 21st. Kay Scarpetta novel was a quick page turner. It is amazing how emersed I became again in the life of Dr.Scarpetta  and her family and colleagues. The way the author develops each character, you never know who remains friend or foe. I must admit I was displeased with Marino's decision to return to become a detective. Although I have read all of the Kay Scarpetta's series it was intriguing ow her past with Marino was portrayed in this book. You never know which character will be intertwined in the horrors that are surrounding the crimes. This novel has Benton in  a vunerable situation at the FBI. To hear Dr. Scarpetta describe her husband and how she defends hims is tantalizing. I always enjoy her niece Lucy's involvement in solving the crimes. Her character does not have any boundaries, her &#34;toys&#34; are out of this world and her computer skills are beyond comprehension.<br />Ms. Cornwell appears to take real life scenarios and create a story that is well researched. She provides the reader with information and details that are outstanding. Her novel is chock full of many angles and plots that it made it difficult to put the book down. She did not disappoint her readers, she again provided us with her story telling ability that is mesmerizing. I highly recommend Dust to anyone who enjoys an action packed, forensic genre book that keeps you guessing until the final few pages, to learn who truly committed not just one but several crimes.

B004SKQAJI|4.0|I've grown up watching Riverdance, Lord of the Dance, and Feet of Flames; my parents even went to see Lord of the Dance when I was a kid! I was excited when they came out with this new show! It definitely is more flashy and theatrical, but it is still captivating. They eliminated some numbers and also the singing portions; however, those are available in the special features. Michael Flatley definitely has aged, but he is still amazingly fast and talented! I definitely would recommend it - especially at the price!
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|it is just like the one on x box but the control is different and the controls is so much easier.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Great Book. It helped me to unbury the basics that I learned some time ago when I started on steels when i was 18 (from an middle age trainer, the one you can't see now a days) which I had lost due to the tons of misinformation from magazines, friends and trainers.<br />I totally recommend this book, it will be the necessary push to get completely motivated that you can actually get great result in a short period of time. I am excited about my new routine and diet plan! I see so many people and trainers on the gym every day doing exactly the mistakes that Mike describes perfectly on this book!<br />I would this book to a lot of friends here in Chile but unfortunately not all of them can read in English. Please Mike publish an Spanish version!
B00FJG7KGM|4.0|My daughter (5)  was the one begging me to get this as she's listened to some of Joan's other work.  This isn't as strong as some of her prior work but is a great release nonetheless.  My biggest issue is there are not as many rockers along the sound of &#34;I love rock & roll&#34; and &#34;I hate myself&#34;
0385351399|4.0|I enjoyed this book a lot, even though it was (deliberately I think) unrealistic and way over the top. Eggers gives us a glimpse into the forming of a  &#34;utopian&#34; future where everything that we do and say is online. The rational behind this is given by one of the protagonist's employers at a Google like company. Society would be better if people knew that they were always being watched and if they behaved accordingly.<br /><br />The protagonist is stupid, naive and increasingly unlikable as her behavior gets more and more unbelievable. Also unbelievable is the acceptance by a large chunk of society of the increased intrusion into the private lives of others...but this story is over the top deliberately. It's an exaggeration of what could happen if we hand over our privacy to the Internets.
B00015YVD6|5.0|Big Fan of the film .The added background work was insightful. Has a treasured place in my collection.would recc. it to all mermaid fans
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Everyone is playing so thought I would give it a try.  Frustrating that you can only play so long and then have to wait.  But probably good because I get stuff done in-between.  Think I like Jewel Twist v1.01 better as can go diagonal as well.
B0036EH3X4|5.0|Fair warning up front there will be spoilers in the review so if you have not seen it, proceed at your own risk.<br /><br />Lost started out as a series about a group of castaways stuck on a mysterious island.  Throughout the 6 seasons it veered off in a lot of different directions.  The final season was really about telling the backstory of the island, and revealing the fates of the characters.  I think your level of enjoyment of the last season will really depend on what you think of the story of the island and the big reveal at the end.<br /><br />In this season we finally get to see Jacob and we learn who and what the smoke monster is.  The monster takes Locke's form and Terry O'Quinn plays a great bad guy for really most of the 16 episodes.  We are also shown flash sideways which shows an alternate timeline for the characters.  It is based on the premise that the plane does not crash (that detonating the bomb at the end of season 5 worked), but we find that the characters do not exactly go back to their old lives.  That things have changed significantly.  It also provides the opportunity for bringing back some of the characters that had been previously killed off.  That story is shown concurrently with the bomb not working and everyone still being stuck on the island.<br /><br />The ending is really open to interpretation.  We find out that the sideways world was not real but a kind of limbo, hence Desmond waking everyone up.  In the end we learn that everyone has died and is meeting again in the sideways world.  We do not know however if they died in the initial crash, if all the events on the island really played out as we saw, or if the plane really makes it off the island in the final shot of the show.  That they did is hinted at when Jack's father says that everyone died at different times, but we do not really know how the survivors went on to live out the rest of their lives.  I think those are all interesting questions that they leave up to the viewers.<br /><br />The hallmark of the series was really the wonderful acting and the character development.  If you look back from season 1 to the end at the \\"main\\" characters, those who were around until the end really did change and evolve.  Given that it was such an ensemble cast that was almost necessary for the series to do well.<br /><br />As far as the actual discs go for those who buy them as opposed to steaming, there is quite a bit of bonus material (although not as much as prior seasons).  You still have the season play option so you can stop and pick up where you left off.  And of course the A/V quality is great.<br /><br />Overall I think the series was excellent.  Although it did take some weird turns here and there, I think the fact that it was so well acted and did try to give the viewers some kind of payoff on all the stories they had going some of that could be overlooked.  You do have to accept that the show does not wrap everything up in a tidy little bow however.  I never watched the show when it was on the air, but I know a lot of people who did got really frustrated with it for going off on all the tangents.  I think those are easier to take when you can watch it on dvd and see it progress watching the episodes back to back without the long breaks.  Things flow better that way and you can see how they were at least attempting to fit things together.<br /><br />I do think 6 seasons (albeit the final three being only partial seasons) was the perfect length for this kind of show.  While some may have preferred a \\"cleaner\\" ending with a straight they get off the island and live happily every after, it was fairly clear from about season 2 on that was not going to be the case.  It is not a perfect show, but it was still very ground breaking and original and definitely one of the better dramas of its time.
B000022TSY|5.0|Had been hunting for this movie for my biker daughter.  Since receiving she has watched 4 times.  Now I have to find her the poster!  Oh, daughter is 44 but never seen it before.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Excellent series, good story lines, and well done.  I wish the 2nd season would come out as free.  I had to request the series from my library to watch it.
B0000033K2|5.0|I love the Atlantic recordings. They broke from the Red Garland-dominated Prestige recordings he did in the late 1950s. I have to guess that he had a piece of the publishing at Atlanta (unlike at Prestige) and that explains the many originals and control over the band meant that the McCoy Tyner, Elvin Jones and bass players could still be heard and these recordings educated the listener's ear and expectation of the 'Trane sound. After the first four or five Impulse Albums, 'Trane left the typical jazz listener behind. I guess the stress of those times (Viet Nam, Assassinations and Civil Rights) demanded the later screaming and honking. I saw him then and he had just left me behind. But for me the Atlantic recordings  the best and most listenable period. RIP Neshui Eurtegun.
B00FFERTUK|3.0|If you have none of their albums, then this is a great starting place. If you're already a fan and have all or most of their albums, then this brings nothing in the form of extras like hard-to-find songs, an accompanying DVD or new material. It's surprising that a second version wouldn't be offered to accommodate the pre-existing long-term fans, who will only buy this if they are completists/collectors.
B00B8PRDHE|5.0|This is the best programmed All Starr band so far. The surprise is the bassist, part of Mister Mister who is surprisingly moving, Todd Rundgren does his thing well as do the rest of the band.

B00BHWG1OO|4.0|Allen Toussaint can do better than this. He is too modest. His performances in Piano Players Never Play Together (find it) and on Elvis Costello's Spectacular series on Sundance showcase him better. The first album I ever bought was The Wild Sounds of Touscan (Allen Toussaint) to get to Happy Times (it also included Java). Toussaint is brilliant (listen to the arrangements he did for The Band at the Last Waltz).
B007R11DKQ|4.0|I thought the fantasy and art direction was very good. The plot bogged down, especially in the middle third of the movie, but it had a satisfactory ending. FUN!
B0016OM3TU|5.0|The best jazz film ever. Dexter Gordon Was nominated for an Oscar for his acting of the Lester Yourng/ Bud Powell- based character and Herbie Hancock won one for the sound track. A very moving experience you will never forget.
0316322407|5.0|An honest story from a courageous young woman about life under Taliban oppression and terror and Pakistani politics and culture.
B00FLDG52I|5.0|Get's better every year. Sonny Landreth, Derek Trucks, Warren Haynes and the Allman Brothers are brilliant. But watch out for  14-year old Quinn Sullivan with Buddy Guy (where is Samantha Fish, by the way) and other young musicians. It's a well programmed show with one great version and great band after another. Listen to the whole series.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|I really hate all of Baz Luhrmann's films. And this is no exception. It is truly terribly. If you want flashy, superficial and void of any emotional depth - then you'll love it. How the hell can you mess up a classic I ask. He does it spectacularly.
B00BF2RV22|5.0|Magic Miles supported by Wallace Roney (sitting next to Miles to play the notes he could no longer play). I wish I were there but this concert has been out on laserdisc for over a decade and in the Miles Montreux  box set.
B00G91Z8AQ|5.0|it exceeded my expectations in every way.Henry Cavill is the best Superman ever!one of the best superhero movies I have ever seen.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I'm really not sure where to start.  Mr Ryan has a truly excellent story here. The hero is heroic, but human, the world is detailed and the author conveys those details to you without having to launch into endless explanations which interrupt the story.  He mixes politics and religion into the lives of the characters and pulls you along into the story.  Engrossing, entertaining, and very well written.  I'm really looking forward to the next book of the series.
B00E7SFAAG|4.0|Very good, addictive and challenging (at times) game!  Love the graphics and it is a step above most games available on the kindle.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|Very well written book. It was good to see the perspective of the German pilot.  If war is inevitable, it would be great if all solidiers could be more chivalrous and humane.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This book provides a whole new outlook on how some people become successful and others don't. I read it quite a while ago and can still relate the message it contains to the success or lack thereof of people I know - even including myself.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I know a lot of people weren't happy with the way this trilogy ended. I was. I felt that it was as it should be. I was much more disappointed in the ending of The Hunger Games trilogy because it was SO boring. This was so much better and more meaningful than that! Veronica Roth stays true to who her characters are and I'm grateful for that! (I'm also tired of the whining of so many readers...) Great trilogy and great book.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is a cute game and fun to play. You isn't  have to wait on energy to be restored or a thing lime that.  Cute graphics like a cartoon and it is never ending. Simple to follow easy to play. You build your own kingdom and explore new areas. You build small farms and sell your items with traders to get money. Very relaxing enjoyable.  You should get this game.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is harder than it looks and I use a variety of these types of games at 59. The only thing I don't like is that one has to wait<br />23-25 minutes in between games, to collect enough &#34;lives&#34;. I am not on facebook and this could be why. Give it a try. I've only had it 4 days.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this pretty much straight through and loved it. I have not seen the movie, bot probably will now that I've read the book. I haven't enjoyed one this much in a long while.
B0093QHWLC|3.0|It's an interesting slice of low-life Boston, but it moves slowly and there are some very overwrought performances, mainly that of Sean Penn, who was awarded the Oscar nevertheless.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I already loved her blog and this is just more of the same. Love the drawings, she's very funny, and I'm so glad I ordered this. It's not as much fun on my Kindle since I don't have the color, but I'm planning to buy a few of these books to give as gifts. Great purchase!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's a mindless relaxing game with the most wonderful music. I can't put it down. It works all the time...no glitches. That deserves five stars all by itself.

B00AU15HPC|3.0|I have always been a Moody Blues/Justin Hayward fan.  I must say I was disappointed with the cd.  There are a couple decent songs.  But then Justin singing country it just doesn't fit and the remixes I did not care for.  Justin stick with the things you know best.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Engaging from the beginning a good rhythm throughout a total page turner.<br />Hard to put down a truly great read.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Doing each puzzle and then doing again to reduce the number of moves down to minimum was good brain exercise. The game kept me interested in finishing to the end with harder puzzles. I liked having no ads in this paid but inexpensive game.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I wish get the weather app is not pop up always. Also needs more clock themes than what is there now. They are terrible themes.
B00FFERTUK|1.0|If you are looking for that gift that keeps on giving extremely terrible music you have found your match here. If this is only Volume 1 who can wait to see what's in store for Volume 2. From the same chords played over and over to each song sounding the same this album will live up to everything you've come to expect from the &#34;greatest&#34; Canadian rockers of all time.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl keeps ones guessing.....first you are disgusted with him and then you are disgusted with her family and then you want to just shoot her!!!!  It is well worth the read. Keeps your interest, things are always changing.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|It was only exciting the first part of the movie and then it went down hill from there.  It was hard to believe that a pilot can become that far removed from reality.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|I am so sad to see this series end. There are times when a series is stretched out and you lose interest. This was NOT the case with the Covenant series. Each book was riveting and the story line held my undivided attention. This is my all-time favorite author.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Very good series and I would like more!  Hated for it to end - this is the new popular theme, relevant anarchy equals personal freedom.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|If you loved the first 2 books, you will love this one, even if it is sad and it doesn't end the way you'd expect or want it to, but it's still GREAT! As much as I wish it would have ended differently, it's moving and achingly sad when you get to it, but sometimes that's the point of a book, to make you feel. Allegiant definitely made me FEEL.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is sometimes challenging and sometime easy.  A good game to test the brain.  Can't wait to see how many more rooms I can get out of
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Ok honestly I only downloaded this th  other day for the free coins.  But I started<br />playing and it's a pretty cool game.

030758836X|2.0|This book had a very frustrating ending. Had a very &#34;Sleeping With The Enemy&#34; meets &#34;Double Jeopardy&#34; feel to it until the ending.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|What a disappointment! I was so excited to read this book and see how the story would end. The writing was bad. I could hardly tell which characters point of view I was reading from. Roth made Four into this insecure and frankly annoying character. Tris also became a completely different person. The whole plot was weak. Another rebellion just in a different setting. The ending was really what made me upset. Completely unnecessary death. Why did I invest all Of this interest in these characters only to have Roth kill off Tris? What a waste of a great character.
B009JZPH32|1.0|This movie was bad all around. The story plot was unbelievable and dumb. The acting was bad. And the twist at the ending unnecessary and anti-climactic.

B0089LOG02|4.0|I loved the writing style, and found the story very engaging, but was a little disappointed by the ending.  Recommend.

B00GOQ9M4O|3.0|I thought is was good, though this seasons series does seem to be in decline concerning the script material and dialog. The writers are grasping for straws at this point in keeping this show alive.
1400062071|5.0|Gorgeous, quiet prose and story that will resonate for years. This is the kind of book you'll want to share. Elizabeth Strout is masterful.
1596177373|2.0|I know it's a cheap price for having a set of Tim Burton cards but I was not expecting this kind of cheap quality.
1401937519|3.0|This book is about freeing oneself from whatever expectations we are 'programmed' to live with on this earth. Though there are MANY good points to be gleaned from reading this, I found it to be contradictory to my Christian beliefs. I am, however, happy for the author to have lived such an experience - for her, it saved her life.
B009AMANBA|2.0|I cannot see the greatness of this film.  there were other actors in Hollywood history who did a much better job of portraying Lincoln.  I frankly do not think this is one of Spielberg's better films.  it is a dark movie as I strained to view the scenes.
B001R60ESE|5.0|Saw his concert on PBS - had not heard of him even though he's from my home state! Couldn't wait to get this dvd and hear it all over again. Very talented man!
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Saw Phillip Phillips in concert a few days ago and his guitar playing is amazing! Great live performer. Bought the CD that night at the concert; have loved him since his days on AI - always had my vote and still does.
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|This CD has amazing arrangements done by one of the<br />best singers of the 50's generation. I have seen him twice<br />recently in person, and look forward to the next concert as<br />his music will live forever. He is a great singer, arranger,<br />and composer along with a fine entertainer. Every selection<br />on this CD is outstanding! Hopefully a new Cd will be out soon!<br />Paul your the best!!
B001BANK32|5.0|Loved this book. It was my first time reading Stephen King and it won't be my last. I am a New Englander so I also enjoyed the NH and ME references.
B000P0J024|5.0|If you're a fan of The Traveling Wilburys then this is the cd for you. Such a great cd from beginning to end and the dvd was a convenient plus. Packaging was exemplary. My highest recommendation.
B00GOQ9M4O|4.0|I see this is to be a pivotal (as in directional change) episode in the series and I bet the Governor will be a sort of master of ceremony for what is to come. Perhaps the Governor will be instrumental (or destructive) in reuniting (or impeding the group) with any remaining civilization/government. Reminded me of the Lost episode dedicated to to Richard Alpert's past.
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|Jack has done it once again. His tunes are my kind of beach music or just any day music. Songs are as good as they always have been. He doesn't make a bad album. Great packaging too.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This movie is very entertaining.  After seeing it on cable TV, and subsequently seeing the sequel, I decided to buy the original.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|Alter Bridge is going above and beyond the call of duty with this album. They do song styles that are very different for them on this album. The album is excellent, nonetheless, from beginning to end. I highly recommend listening to this on a car trip. Wonderful.
0790737345|5.0|This is just one of those movies that goes straight for the heart.  Bought this for a friend as I had it already.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This application works well with kindle fire, easy to use! There are many variables to get used to. Just started the game today and got a bit confused with all the choices.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|You have to read this book.  It is by far the most compelling book I've read in a long time. I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to read a great book that isn't about some far-fetched love story gone wrong.
B00FHB7398|5.0|This is one of the best yet! I don't know how they do it, but Big Fish games keep getting better and better! Web of Deceit was totally worth every penny. The graphics were amazing, the storyline was entertaining and the music was top notch! This game lasted longer than any others (which is a huge plus for those of us who favor this genre). The mini games were challenging but not too hard that hints were needed. Everyday, I anxiously await for the latest hidden adventure game to appear in the app store. This one definitely delivered!! I highly recommend this game to veteran gamers and newbies alike. You won't be disappointed!!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|works great but the set up wasn't that easy because of my router settings and it took me a while to solve it.

B00BAXFECK|5.0|A great read. Moves along at a good pace, allowing the reader to envision each character and their surroundings as if you were there watching the story unfold. Easy to read late into the night or at anytime, giving intriguing, non-stop enjoyment.
1601251505|4.0|Delivered quickly, and in good condition. The spin is a little curved, almost as if it was sitting under something heavy for a long time, but the pages are crisp, clean, and all are present. Pathfinder's pretty great, too, and the book itself is really useful for rpgs in general.
0812550706|5.0|I really liked this book. I wanted to read it before the movie came out and now I'm hoping the movie stays close to the heart of the story.
B005JZBP8W|5.0|Amazingly, this is a movie shot entirely on a movie studio sound stage with no special effects, yet one so compelling and unique that may never be duplicated with a sequel or remake - a rarity in Hollywood. The sound track is exceptional.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I felt the book was captivating and held my interest.  It was hard to put down. I will probably purchase another book by this author.
B00338QENI|5.0|this is a piece of history that very few people know about. What an amazing story. it is written sometimes like a historical documentary but very engaging.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book keeps you on your toes continually.  I loved it.  It was well written and kept the reader in suspense.
B00GMONG90|5.0|I've listened to the Daft Punk Medley on Youtube like twenty times and also I have gone back and watched/listened to everything I could find from this group so I actually felt like I've gotten more than my money's worth from the album as I've enjoyed all of the tracks, but particularly 7 and 8. I love the energy and I'm definitely a huge fan of all of them, but really love Avi and Jessie. Keep up the great work!
B002EX7GBC|4.0|Follows closely to the script, and is still a fun movie to watch.  Great for the whole family to watch.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Typical Grisham, well written, believable.  He consistently provides a perspective on southern life and history. Well worth the time to read.
0670024856|5.0|I consider this a great book. It is so full of the love of nature and creation that I am beyond words at the end.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|Wonderful costume drama, explores class differences in England.  Some terrific characters that you want to learn more about as the series progresses.
B0085Y4JF0|5.0|I am a bigger guy and I have to say this fits very well, and there is still room to go bigger. It is light and non-restrictive. Works great for holding my 3 AK without problem, is a little hard to fit 6 into it if not M4 style mags, but I have never needed more than 3 for a single game. has extra molle straps to add pouches on either side of the vest and has a large pocket behind the mag pouches plus 2 on the external of the front straps. makes it easy to keep items like a phone or wallet in that or even a map or other items. For the price you cannot beat it. I would recommend to anyone whether you are just starting or are looking for a smaller rig for those faster paced games.
B00GFOIUVQ|5.0|Excellent graphics. Great gameplay very fun.  Feel the power of Mjolnir! and Thor Odinson!! a must play for fans of Thor.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|This is one of the best origin stories of any superhero.  It has a great story to tell, it tells the story in a simple yet fantastic manner, and the story is well casted.  Super special effects during action scenes....maybe some of the best fight special effects since the matrix.<br /><br />Terrific movie!!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Kept us guessing the entire time! Very good read as are all of Grisham's books :) Thanks, Mike & Trudy.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Really cool game me and kids love it it's almost like we're watching the movie real steel he he ha ha ha ha
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|Could not put it down. Finished the book at 1:35 am, and now I'm wide awake with nothing comparable to read.  This was an exciting read.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|There is a recurring theme in books, movies and plays that I enjoy. It is simple. There is a puzzle to be solved. Often, there are multiple threads of puzzles that eventually come together to make a whole greater than the sum of its parts. This book is a one puzzle book, but is still a fun, satisfying story. As an older person, I have no ideas if the details are correct or even plausible, but I will ask my kids after they all read it. Thanks, Cassie, for the recommendation.
B006O2QNOU|2.0|you can tell was running on as shoe string budget - somewhat well written though, although didn't totally make sense
B007QA3AH2|5.0|Funny Funny Funny... I really enjoyed this movie. Gave me a good laugh when I needed it...If you are a Trekie you will love it
B000I8ES2A|5.0|This is an excellent representation of virtual reality in a movie setting.  Without a lot of bizarre effects and attempts to wow the audience with superficial elements, this movie has a brilliant storyline, solid performances, and a well-thought out world.  The ending is logical and thoroughly satisfying, too.<br /><br />There's not a lot I can say about the plot while avoiding spoilers, but it is a murder mystery involving a secret virtual world, and the hero has to plumb the limits of that world while solving the crime in the &#34;real&#34; world.  I first rented this about ten years ago, thinking it might be like The Matrix.  It's a lot better.<br /><br />It's too bad this movie didn't get proper promotion and marketing when it came out.  The Matrix was good, but this one has a much more engaging plot, more interesting characters, and a more realistic approach to the question of artificial reality.
0385345054|3.0|This is a nice book with great ideas but even the ones they call easy are not so easy. You need some skill to complete these and lots of supplies which could end up being pretty pricey per flower.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|great dvd play it often  thank you
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I liked that I couldn't predict the outcome.  Just when I thought I got it I didn't.  I don't know whether to cheer or be disappointed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a great game and a good time killer. I used to think there was no strategy to this game, it was all luck. I was very  wrong.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|It's not a bad game. The graphics are decent, and the story is cute enough a d I certainly spend too much time playing since I got it two days ago but I don't see it holding my attention too long.
B005COO1X6|3.0|The story was just not enough for an avid Stephen King fan. It was alright but it was more like he spent a few hours writing it.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|An excellent story - loved every page of it.  Covers the history of a 100-year-old man who isn't ready to give up just yet.  Entertaining, funny, satirical, just an excellent read.
B00ESNE696|3.0|The show is good but the price is too high for a rerun. It should be 99 cents or less.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Very nice collection of the Peter Falk classics.  Loved every minute of it, even though the guest stars were sort of mediocre towards the end of the series.  Columbo was one of the better detective stories of its time, and it almost holds up decades later.
B005MLP71Y|4.0|It entertained the my son on a rainy day.  Purchase and viewing was easy.  Would leverage Amazon again for other movies.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I loved reading this book. It is an inspiring and quite an interesting read, although I have not yet broken the boundary over to ultra.
1400069289|5.0|One of the best social psychology books I have read with great, practical tips as well as very interesting business stories.  Parts of the book were printed in the NY Times - the author is a Times writer.  The story about P&G's development of Febreeze and the ways habits are formed and can be broken are each worth the price of the book.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|I thought the movie was pretty good but some of the scene transitions the story line was hard to understand.<br />Entertaining.
0316287059|5.0|love kevin's books! i discovered him through his books, great pictures of his best work, and some guidelines and products he used
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I left this book feeling empowered to do better in my life. To Be Strong. I felt this whole series was out of the norm of distopian youth fiction (it even lacks a love triangle, which is the least of the norms it avoids). The characters actions have actual consequences, and the theme of forgiveness is beautifully written. Read the other books first, but don't skip this series.
0385743564|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, so much that I had a hard time putting it down and read it very quickly. I am a fan of Sanderson's though I believe his last novel which was called The Way of Kings I believe I wasn't overly fond of. In this novel he places the action in our world though a version of it gone bad. Taking the super powered person concept and turning it on it's head by making all those given powers bad gives this series a twist and potential for greatness. Now I'm looking forward to the next in the series.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|show has a slight twist between humor and drama.  Most shows take it extreme an either direction while this one keeps a decent balance.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|It was a great book, but a very different feel than the shining. A must read for fans who need to know what happened after.
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|Lost is an intelligent adult show. Instead of focusing on the resolution of the various plot lines, focus on the characters and the message. After watching a few dozen episodes, it becomes clear that resolving all the plot lines is impossible. Don't bother to try. Just go along for the ride. The characters are damaged (lost) and that is intentional so try to not let that bother you. The show is addictive and at the end of each episode there is a hook that makes you want to immediately watch the next one. Remember that in television, the writers have to make it up as they go along. They never know when the show will be cut. That is why some plot lines eventually are forgotten. That's the reality of television. Accept it. Finally, I never had a greater involvement with a character than mine for Kate. After watching a few episodes, it might be worth your while to google Evangeline Lilly to read about her and how she got the part. It would be hard to imagine any actress more perfect for a part.
B005ZI2ZUK|4.0|\\"Over The Fence\\" by children's author Peter W. Collier is a cute little rhyming story involving the mystery of what's in the box on the other side of the fence.<br /><br />Young children are given the opportunity to use their imaginations to try and guess the contents of the box that has been delivered next door. There are several colorful pictures in this book and the use of rhyme is bound to please the young reader and make the experience more enjoyable. Unlike some other books....the reader is kept guessing as to what could actually be in the box. This concept, gives the child the opportunity to totally use their own imagination to figure out what could possibly be in the box. In other words...anything is possible and that is what mysteries are all about...piecing the clues together.<br /><br />Inspirational Author & Book Reviewer ~ Dolores Ayotte<br />[[ASIN:B00F6YPFAU Growing Up & Liking It]]
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I cried so hard at the end of this book. It is incredibly touching and really makes up think about life. I recommend this book to everyone. John Green is a freaking genius.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Gaiman's sweet spot seems to be about the length of a novella; even his longer works aren't all that long, and he seems most at ease when telling short stories, whether they are connected are not. The Ocean at the End of the Lane, which feels like perhaps his most personal written work yet, is really just an embellished short story, with elements of Coraline and American Gods tying back to a young boy in a young place not all too dissimilar to Gaiman's own childhood. The story doesn't go anywhere unexpected, really, but it's vintage Gaiman, a sweet, sad peek into a world just beyond our own. It's not the best he's ever done, and it won't turn you into a fan if you weren't one already, but for fans of his work, it's like a comfortable armchair of a story.
B001TAJGO6|1.0|Lasted 48 minutes into it and gave up.  I thought it was boring, confusing, and didn't care for the acting.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|The first Vampire Weekend album took time to really get to me, but eventually I was able to see the brilliance in the Paul Simon and Police-inspired indie world/yacht-rock they were peddling. With \\"Contra\\" I crossed from fan to HUGE fan, and I admit to some trepidation leading into \\"Modern Vampires\\". How many bands can deliver three great albums, much less in a row, and to launch a career, no less?<br /><br />My fears, it turned out, were completely unfounded. Not only is \\"Modern Vampires of the City\\" an excellent album, it's the best Vampire Weekend has ever released. At this point it's safe to worry not when they will stumble, but where the ceiling is.<br /><br />It starts out unassumingly enough, with the relaxed \\"Obvious Bicycle\\". It's patient and unhurried, meandering but with purpose as it winds its way through four minutes like some kind of pre-album overture. Starting with \\"Unbelievers\\", Vampire Weekend returns to the joyous and boisterous sound they've been known for before now, with immaculately crafted pop songs that run the gamut from the chamber pop of \\"Step\\", with its gorgeous choir denouement to the fiery \\"Diane Young.\\" The album's highest peak, however, is \\"Ya Hey.\\" The title might make one think of a cheeky Outkast reference, but in reality it's a devastating paean to the Christian god. Anyone remotely familiar with their Old Testament will not only catch the references but also the deep heartache of worshiping Yahweh: \\"Through the fire and through the flames/You won't even say your name/Only I Am That I Am\\".<br /><br />The album at large deals with the surprisingly heavy topics of aging, death, and religion, all wrapped up in sublime melody and impeccable arrangement. Whether they're ripping through the galloping \\"Worship You\\" or slowly moving through \\"Hannah Hunt\\", there is no doubt that this is a band that pays attention to every detail imaginable while leaving the end result look easy, as if anyone could do it. That's not possible, of course, but that's how Vampire Weekend makes it look.t that's how Vampire Weekend makes it look.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I love this book it's so funny and it made me tear a little bit the story of this little boy trying to figure out how to live his own life without bullying

B00B5HQLMI|4.0|I am not the biggest Bond guy out there, but this one was better than most.  I thought it was certainly entertaining and worth the watch.
B000FC2L1E|4.0|To be honest, I sometimes wonder how Jamie and Claire survive the emotional stresses and physical abuses of the Outlander novels.  Like the two previous novels in the series, both Jamie and Claire survive substantial hardships to be and remain together in this tale that takes us from Scotland to the West Indies and beyond.  There were times in this harrowing story when I felt that their perils were so extreme that they felt contrived just for the sole purpose of creating angst and tension.  That said, I was as engrossed in Voyager every bit as much as the previous two.  However, I will probably take a break before starting book four.  I'm exhausted.
B00005MP58|5.0|I consider this Jane Austin's masterpiece. I love having it in my house where I can watch it any time I feel like it!
0788603248|2.0|Tossed in the garbage after watching. The video quality was nothing special on my Sony Bravo 40inch 1080p played by my Panasonic Blu-Ray. The scenes covered were nothing special if you watch a lot of travel videos.
0800141660|5.0|It's hard to find high quality entertainment these days.  Well look no further, this movie has the full range of humor, sadness, cleverness, high values and is very engaging.  Emma Thompson has done a find job in re-creating this classic.  I love it in that it is  very low stress. This movie needs to be in your classic movie collection!
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|This game is pretty good. But the Facebook connection is not working. I will give the game 5 stars when it happens.
0385738757|5.0|Fast Paced fun book to read!  This was my favorite book of the series.  Will make an excellent movie in a few years
B001NA6096|4.0|This was the first in the series of movies over actual time..........Great idea. Not much action but lots of dialog. Really enjoyed the concept in real time......
006202406X|2.0|I felt this book was a poor ending to a series.  I was not a fan of two different narrators.

0385351399|4.0|The Circle is a dystopian view of Silicon Valley set in a future time that could be, oh, sometime the day after tomorrow. Dave Eggers has crafted a story set in the corporate campus environment of a fictional social media company that will seem all too familiar to anyone who has spent time in the headquarters of a Facebook, Apple or Google.<br /><br />While the plot, as many reviewers have noted, can be a little creaky, the main thesis of the book is that the world of social media that many of us have rushed headlong into has threatening potential. By trading privacy (you have none, get over it, a tech titan once remarked) for ease of communication with our circle of friends we have entered a Faustian bargain with the bright young sparks who have created the social media sites we love to love.<br /><br />The book’s main character is a young woman at the start her career. She starts work at the company named “The Circle” that provides the kind of college-dorm on steroids environment the Google and Facebook’s of the world are famous for: free food, parties, famous musicians, fire-eaters & jugglers at company events. With a workplace like this, why leave? The on campus crash pads have refrigerators stocked with goodies, it’s summertime and the living is easy.<br /><br />However, it isn’t long before the summer sun turns into a winter of discontent.<br /><br />Our twenty-something heroine slowly realizes that the success on her work position is associated with activities that are anything but voluntary, like attending events and sharing everything with the Circle community, about each and every minute of her life, as a company motto states: “Sharing is Caring”.<br /><br />To outline any more of the plot would be to spoil the shock of recognition that those of us who spend time in and around Silicon Valley must feel when reading about the All Hands Meetings, customer service centers, managerial shenanigans and office romances on the shores of the San Francisco Bay.<br /><br />The weirdest part of the reading The Circle, for me, what what I started noticing in the news after I put the book down. The headlines suddenly seemed to be taken from later chapters. Literally, in the last two weeks, I’ve seen news reports about a mysterious barge Google is building on the Bay; Palo Alto police might start wearing body-mounted cameras (hopefully, as in the novel, they’ll automatically switch off for three minutes while the user in the toilet); and, just in time for this blog posting, The Economist reports that “life-loggers” are embracing the potential of Google Glass to create a people’s panopticon.<br /><br />The Circle is an entertaining read. Recommended.cisco Bay.<br /><br />The weirdest part of the reading The Circle, for me, what what I started noticing in the news after I put the book down.

B001N9ESQ4|3.0|Again enjoyed writers concept. Using same actors was of course essential to story line and big draw for me to see another chapter in the lives of the characters.
B00FXMECS6|1.0|I don't know why but i thought this movie sucked! and the hole time I was watching this supposedly HD which I paid an extra 2-3 dollars for the version it came in crappy! I have a excellent connection, HD LCD screen and never had problems watching movies in HD before. I just don't like paying for them and not getting them. Too bad I can't upload an image of the horrible video.
B0089LOG02|5.0|What a wonderful book!  Very well written, interesting, and a triumph of the human spirit.  I would highly recommend this book.
B00F880BWG|5.0|The walking dead is by far my favorite show that has been on TV in the last 20 years. Great design, and dialog hope they make it into a movie!
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I LOVE her and this book has great additions to her blog. I am happy knowing I can re-read this at any time! :)
B001JU6CGG|4.0|I think the main problem with this movie is the audience.  Many seem to prefer the convoluted slow paced bore-fest of the first movie, or perhaps they liked the cerebral psychological thriller of the third.  Or maybe they prefer to see Tom Cruise looking effing ridiculous alongside hawkeye wearing a hoodie.<br /><br />A movie should be judged on it's own merits, not as a comparison to some other source material, and the audience simply refuses to set aside bias and enjoy MI2 for what it is; a terrificly compelling action movie.<br /><br />Particularly great sequences involving Thandie Newton (Nyah) and a gritty yet stylistic endgame fight set to solely percussion make it memorable, and not forgettable despite what other reviews might say.  If action, explosions, heroics do not interest you in a movie, no one is forcing you at gunpoint to watch and then write a half-intelligent review of MI2.  So just step away from the keyboard.
B00CP6AZMU|4.0|Didn't use the annotation but the story is very interesting especially since Dorian Gray. It has horror and dry British Humor. Also the moral is &#34;be careful what you ask for&#34;.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|I read this in one day and it falls in line with my already in place belief system about the detriment of grains; and the importance of certain foods that aid in health and well being of our bodies from head to toe.  I liked hearing all this information from a Dr.  And one that could think beyond conventional teachings of the medical community.  I also bought a copy for a friend because I think spreading this knowledge will make us healthy senior citizens when the time comes and healthy individuals all around.  Thank you for your work Dr. Perlmutter.
B00BKZUVGM|3.0|This was a disappointing end to a series I had been really enjoying. In fact, it spoiled the trilogy completely for me.
B003B02O0A|5.0|Grisham's best book in my opinion.  Would love to see a new edition with Ellen Roark's character included in the end, but that's not my call. A great read.<br />Jeffsurf
B00B2FLDRQ|5.0|What a breath of fresh air! So intelligent, with laugh out loud moments, great depth to characters and the sweetest romance I've read in a long time. A MUST READ!!!! I have told everyone I know. I am really looking forward to Graeme Simsion's next book. Such an excellent author.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|A fun, easy read drawing from the author`s own childhood and professional experience. As a viewer of 30 Rock and SNL, it was also interesting to hear about what happens behind the scenes. Given that the author is a TV writer, I suppose I expected the book would be well-written, but I was even pleasantly surprised by her prose.
0312117337|2.0|I was torn between one and two stars but decided to give it the benefit of the doubt, and also because many of the cards are quite evocative.<br /> But it needs to be recognised that this deck is indeed focused around the teachings of the guru Osho. The name alone lets you know that but many may not be aware Osho is the new name the disgraced guru from Oregon, Bhaghwan Shree, took when he was deported back to India. I'm somewhat neutral in the matter of spiritual leaders, but it turns out this deck is just a little too 'guru'-ish for me. Yes, many tarots have their own flavor and slant, but this one is too 'personality' focused for my taste, especially for use as a primary deck.<br />One card actually shows a portrait of the guru, and all commentaries are taken from teachings of Osho. There are 79 cards and 79 quotes from Osho literature. So it can safely be said this deck is imbued with the teachings of this guru. It's good to know this upfront before buying it, as I didn't. A few of the quotes are a little too strident for an oracle deck I felt.<br />An odd thing happened when I started handling the deck. I felt an 'off' energy for some reason, that made me uneasy. That was strange as I've never had quite that reaction to an oracle deck before. I was also a little puzzled by the card showing the guru Osho. I wasn't sure why it was there as it wasn't part of the normal tarot sequence. It was an extra card, which upon reading is called the Master card, to \\"help one to leave the spiral behind, jump off the wheel of death and rebirth, and symbolizes the ultimate transcendence of journeying itself, a transcendence that becomes possible only through the dissolving of the separate, individual ego\\". It's ironic a card of the ultimate transcendence, beyond matter and karma, shows a named spiritual leader on it. That doesn't seem appropriate for a neutral tarot system. That put me off a little.<br />Ultimately that was the thing that put me off about the entire deck. It just didn't have neutrality - it's a deck created around a guru and his teachings, and appended onto a tarot system. Whether you don't mind that or do, it's good to know it going in. After a bit, I just started feeling there was too much proselytizing inherent in this deck.<br />It had some nice points, of course, some beautiful cards, but the worth of a deck is in the readings and coherent system. As a whole, it just wasn't a deck I could use personally. The Master card felt very off-putting to me, I didn't like touching it, so I finally ended up tossing it. That made the deck feel a little better, but not enough and not completely. I tried clearing it and neutralizing it energetically, but it's inherent in the deck. I don't want my tarot deck to feel the way this one does, so I passed on it finally.

B005LAIIMG|5.0|DVD arrived in perfect condition and before the predicted delivery date.   Oh God, another ZOMBIE movie!  Look what the \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" has grown into. There are a lot of zombie themed films and books and stuff about. So, why watch one more? This one is from a main line studio with A list stars and a moving plot. A fast moving plot...that follows how a plague could travel the planet in days accurately. Only this plague is a virus that causes zombies. Brad Pitt stars as a retired United Nations \\"troubleshooter\\" for the Secretary General who gets unwillingly recalled to the job by the emergency of the wildfire infection racing around the world. We go from Philadelphia to a US Navy task force evacuation fleet off the coast of New Jersey, to South Korea, Israel, and finally a World Health Organization research facility in Cardiff Wales. All in about thirty hours time. The pace of the film is frenetic  due to the rapid spread of an unknown virus. And I mean rapid...from bite by an infected zombie to a full blown dead and biting zombie in TWELVE SECONDS. Can Gerry (Brad Pitt) find the source of the plague and a means to an antidote or vaccination? Watch it and find out...and do not expect all happy stuff as the movie concludes.   I liked this film. I enjoy the growing zombie rage in entertainment. Hey, when I was a teen, one of my favorite singing groups WAS \\" The Zombies\\"(\\"She's Not There\\")!  I never miss the best series on TV, \\"THE WALKING DEAD\\" , so of course I had to get this one. I enjoy all the different \\" takes\\" on zombies by different writers, directors, creators, make-up artists, etc. But these World War Z zombies are not your everyday \\"Walkers\\" stumbling by eating people. These zombies are FAST! They run, they climb stuff well and quickly, they break glass easily, and they aren't biting you to feed..they bite to spread the virus...that seems their only drive once infected. WOW.  Seeing a major city overrun in minutes is chilling to watch...and to me,the best and most jarring scene is the virus being spread on an airliner in flight..with our hero on the plane with an idea for antidote about to be infected...a hand grenade can sure be useful!!    Watch this one to see what I'm talking about. Highly recommended!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Freed book download offered online if I tried kindle on iPad can't wait to read so I can purchase the rest of the book series. Since I loved the movie.
B00GINENG0|5.0|You get to customize your tom to look how you want but for you to do that you have to get the money for it first. You get to feed him take him to the bathroom put him in bed play with him and once you get to specific levels your tom grows. To me this game is the best but it might not be to you. You have to get the game before you say that you don't like it. Have fun playing!

B001MTENOC|5.0|Fantastic insight into the understanding of life.  Helps in the way one may live their life for the better and takes away the fear of our passing.  Nothing to do with religion.
B000P0J06K|5.0|Purchased this movie for my girlfriend with left over points on my Amazon reward card. I was looking at her wishlist and noticed this. The price was great. You seriosly probably couldn't get a better deal anywhere else. The packaging was original and the disc was in perfect condition. Would suggest this purchase.

1451648545|4.0|Steve Jobs, arguably, was  one of the most important persons in the tech world.  His accomplishments are mind-bending.  He truly was a genius and proved that starting up Apple wasn't a fluke, since he accomplished so much more in his short life, including his time<br />at Pixar.  Through his return to head Apple, where he was previously ousted, his talent had matured, and at his zenith he created the I-pod, I-phone, and I-pad.  This genius, however, wrestled with many inner demons,  and that to me, is the most fascinating part of the book.  Famous for his temper tantrums, and a myriad of quirks, this book illustrates and delves into his complicated psyche and reveals some fascinating details about the man.
B004SIMNF0|5.0|A really really really useful invention. Eventually I bought the second holster, as I always shoot with two cameras at weddings - one loaded with a 24-70mm the other with a 70-200mm. I've been shooting weddings professionally for 5+ years, and I didn't realize that the ache and swelling and pain in my should was mainly the result of hanging a heavy camera body + large lens + speedlite from my neck for 8 hours (duh! right?) But since moving everything off my neck, storing the straps, and hanging everything off my hips from the Spider Pro my back shoulder pain is significantly less. My gear is much more accessible, I feel (and probably look) like much less of a geek at my weddings, not having all that stuff hanging off my neck. This is a TRULY GREAT PRODUCT, one of the very best photography accessories I've purchased in years.
B004H1U2HE|4.0|This autobiographical retrospective about an interesting moment in time in the history of the Jewish people and the creation of their nation offered a unique perspective of a unique moment in time<br /><br />Interviews with older relatives was helpful in appreciating the times leasing up to that moment.<br /><br />The history of this particular author and his family life provided yet another level to the story.<br /><br />Held my interest and enjoyed.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Best of its class. So many ways to explore the Bible. So many pre-defined learning plans, each one different, for different styles and different focus. Very well designed. And it's free. I've learned so much about Jesus Christ from this app, wish I'd had it when I was younger. makes reading the bible as easy as possible.
B0089EHWQE|3.0|The story was relative fluff in spite of the disability of one of the lead characters.<br />It was a fast, easy read but not particularly intellectually stimulating or thought provocative.

B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|This is a simple story, and an easy read - yet one that contains some thought provoking themes.Makes you wonder about all the online sharing. Every time Google or Facebook pulled a privacy related move the past weeks I had to think back about this book.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Loved it and I couldn't put it down. The authors trek and personal story was amazing, often ugly and yet inspirational. There's some real grit in here and I really admire the author's candid delivery, great writing and the ups and downs a long the way. Definitely a good choice if you enjoy outdoor stories and self development.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I have been a Star Trek fan since I was a little girl, and the newest installments of Star Trek live up to everything I hoped for.  Zachary Quinto and Chris Pine breathe new life into characters I grew up loving and I was more than happy to receive my copy of this movie as a birthday gift!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I would give this book more than 5 stars if I could. ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! The writing is excellent, precise and descriptive.  I love how the author tied in the multiple story lines of the different characters. She details the feelings of her characters so well you feel like you know them and I felt their pain, anger, joy and sorry. And just when I think I am about to judge a character, we are shown those mixtures of gray that don't make everything so cut and dry, especially the epilogue!  The book really makes you think, &#34;what would I do&#34; and shows how delicately lives are altered. I am definitely going to read the other works of Liane Moriarty.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I had been so excited to read this book and once I started it... let's just say that it took me a long time to get through and about halfway through, I didn't care anymore.  I only finished it because I had hoped it would pick up the same pacing and intrigue that drove the first two books - which I thought were excellent!  Just very disappointing

B000W198QY|5.0|I really enjoy India Arie's music. Her voice is so soulful, and her music touches the spirit. Great mood music.
B00COGXGNQ|1.0|Things I wished I'd done instead of watching this movie:<br /><br />Eat spoiled eggs<br />Put sriracha sauce in my eyes<br />Get eaten by zombies<br /><br />Imagine &#34;A Walk to Remember&#34; but even more boring and cheesy, with a random and pointless &#34;The Sixth Sense&#34; twist at the very end that doesn't tie into the movie at all. That's this movie. And if you decide to watch it after reading this review... well, you've been warned.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|The Warren's are well known in the field. The movie has a lot of classic jump moments but doesn't over-do it. They didn't have to try to go over the top with blood and gore because the story was dark enough itself. A great movie if you're into classic horror films.
B000002AGB|5.0|Classic Who! The Who in their prime, at the top of their &#34;game.&#34; Right up there with Live at Leeds. The version of Tommy here surpasses the Live at Leeds version. Love it!

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad to get this on my kindle.  I have been playing it on my computer but was glad to start al over to have the convenience of playing on my kindle.
B00F38GDNM|5.0|My rating is for the original album, not the deluxe version. I'm pretty tired of bands re-releasing their albums with additional content only months after the original release, and I should have known it would happen with this release since he did the same thing with his last album. It seems to me to be a big f*** you to the fans, like me, who bought the album when it originally came out.  I'll probably wind up re-buying it so I can get the new tracks on cd, but I really resent being asked to fork over more money for something I already have.  Why not release the new album as a separate cd so that those who already bought the album don't have to buy it again? It smacks of money-grubbing, and I'm very disappointed in Kurt.
B000J233SK|1.0|This CD was DEAD right out of the box.  The EXCELLENT Amazon customer service made it right, but the seller sold me a dead CD for a NEW price.  I little QUALITY CONTROL can go a long way, and aleviate a lot of headaches in the customer service department.
B000IZ8DZQ|3.0|Not as good as the more recent effort by Donald Sutherland and Mark Wahlberg. This one lacks the sizzle of the newer one.
1743383843|2.0|Yes it is a book. The  font was very small and the book was not an abnormal size. Very weird
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is one of Grisham's best! Here's a story with lots of intriguing twists. It's a mystery with very human characters that engage the reader completely. I'm glad Grisham hasn't decided to quit writing and if he has more of this quality up his sleeve, I'm eager to have it! This one is well worth the money and the time to read it!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Very intense season. You can never guess what will happen next. Can't wait to watch the next season,  Very interesting story line.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Awesome movie looks great in blu ray. Lots of colors very vivid picture. Quinton Tarentino is epic. Love Django. Word

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I just love it . I gave it to my baby niece and she laugh. I recommend this game for any age even baby. You have too buy it you don't want to miss the fun.
B003K15IF8|5.0|This is an amazing book that I might not have heard of or read had I not seen it recommended on Goodreads. It isn't the type of story that would normally appeal to me. But it truly is a perfect novel that I will be recommending forever.<br /><br />William Stoner is the son of parents struggling to make a living on their farm in southern Missouri in the early 1900's. Stoner leaves the farm to major in agriculture at the University of Missouri with the intention of eventually using his degree to improve the farm. Instead, he discovers a passion for studying and teaching literature, and never returns to the farm. He becomes a professor, marries and has a child.<br /><br />Stoner is the story of a man who lives what most would consider a very ordinary life. Yet he is not an ordinary man, and this not an ordinary story. This book is soulful, and my heart ached at some of the hurts and disappointments weathered by Stoner who I considered an honorable good man.<br /><br />This book is going to stay with me for a very long time. In fact, it is the kind of book that can be life-changing, if you let it. The writing is absolutely beautiful in its starkness. The characters are perfectly written and developed. What appears simple is not. I highly recommend this perfect American novel
0316322407|5.0|You will appreciate being alive in the USA and the simple things we take for granted. ie. hot water clean water a warm house a safe town warm clothes etc.

B006ZL1KAW|5.0|Best guided meditation I have come across. Easy to use and insightful. Calming voice and different message each day. Excellent!
0374531269|3.0|After ending my reading I wanted to learn more of the life of this boy soldier. I made searches in the internet and it was a surprise to learn that facts that he mentions in the book never occurred; even the name of presidents or leaders are not real or correct. I am very dissapointed not because the story is not real but because the author pretended us to believe that this is a real story. I would be better to write a novel and show respect to the readers.
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|I've followed HONY on Facebook for several months and so enjoyed the glimpses into real lives.  This book is a continuation of the same glimpses.  The photography is wonderful.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I really like it a lot! Although no one could think this is possible - because no respectful law firm will dare to hire a non-lawyer to impersonate a lawyer- it does not matter. After all I am not looking for reality but for fun.
B00G0KY1UO|5.0|Best game ever you should try it your self and you could defeat it and play some more and also it is fun!!!
B0017HEX76|5.0|An affordable way to own history, there are others out there, but for the money, well this was a way to own it with out paying a fortune
B0039PPW60|5.0|I'm a fan. I am a singer/songwriter who plays keyboard/guitar/vocals and I'm very pleased with this unit. I personally feel the Xenyx's built-in-reverb is far superior to that of it's Mackie competitor. It's just so much more natural and organic sounding. The kind you would want to hear in a nice acoustic cafe-style venue.<br /><br />Usability-wise, I have no complaints. This unit is as straightforward as it gets. If you have questions, Behringer's phone support team is very helpful. Happy I went with this guy.
0694003611|5.0|Wonderful childrens book for all ages the story is memorable and she will always ask for it great addition to a childs library
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Movie is great, I could watch this over and over! If you liked the first one, you will definitely enjoy this one!
B0000931QA|5.0|To these well-tuned ears, this very possibly could be the greatest album of all-time, out of every genre or era of music. I'm not going to waste time going into great detail about every nuance on this album, it's just something that needs to be heard to be believed. I think these so-called music journalists and \\"critics\\" need to re-evaluate their choices for the greatest albums ever. 'Operation: Mindcrime' makes albums as \\"important\\" as 'Sgt. Pepper' and 'Pet Sounds' sound like amateurish bubblegum. This album is also prophetically relevant to the state of the US today, and this was recorded 25 years ago?! Very eerie when you listen to it now. If you don't own this album, shame on you.
B00E72OKAS|5.0|superb mindless awesomeness best most funniest dress relieving wickedly awesome coolness no better way to pass free time crush zombies with cool vehicles and upgrade them to get farther a nd crush more. mindless destruction! sweet

B007ZGBZHE|3.0|It lacked the old scariness of the original Pendergast books.  They were the best.  They had those wonderful thriller elements missing  from this book.  It was disappointing.
B008602KQI|5.0|I love it.  Great story.  I saw the movie first, then read the book.  Watched the movice again getting ready for &#34;Catching Fire&#34;, the second of the three books.
B006R1T40I|5.0|Great CD. Saw her on this tour Oct. 9 in San Rafael. She is such a classy lady. Couple Bob Dylan tunes that she improved upon immensely. Can't go wrong with this CD.
0345803485|4.0|I couldn't get through the first 1/3rd of the book .... .it's just so poorly written.  However, the set was delivered in a timely manner and was clearly brand new.  I gifted it to my cousin.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book was true to John Grisham's form and that was what I was hoping for.  The fact that it was a Jake Briggance story just made it even better.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect. A Tarentino western?? It sounded odd. So, I put off seeing this for months despite great reviews. Word of mouth finally got to me. Turns out that this is one of the best Quentin Tarentino has done. The film's humor is twisted, demented and timeless. Sometimes in your face. Other times subtle. The film addresses important issues but is pure entertainment. It will spark conversations afterwards and make you go back to watch again and see what you may have missed. Excellent, rich character performances from talented actors abound. Delicious period accents. Gorgeous costumes. Why did I wait so long?? Just see it!!
B008602KQI|5.0|Ok.  The movie is just plain good.  But this was my first time watching a movie via Amazon's streaming service.  Easy.  Slick.  It worked better than I was expecting.  I'm so glad I finally signed up for Prime.
B000008M54|5.0|Fisherman's Blues is the definitive Celtic traditional infused rock record of all times. This is how it's done, and Mike Scott created his own genre! This record is a template of excellence through and through. An absolute must have!
B003INBNXO|5.0|I first caught this on *certain streaming service* and just had to have it. I am a fan of kung fu movies and this was an instant favorite.  High production values, top notch choreography and a good story (even if some of the facts are bent a little, but the story did make me research Ip Man's actual life, so it was a learning experience as well). Even so I am certain that Donnie Yen captured Ip Man's personality and essence. Fans of martial arts would appreciate that this man was one of Bruce Lee's teachers and thus had a profound effect on the art and on the world.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Watched this with my husband. It didn't really do much for me and I'm a big fan of the mission impossible and Bourne movies. Husband says it was fine, but didn't really draw him in. It was just something to watch.
B004I1AGTC|5.0|Where does one go after such a good story as the first movie? Off to a new city and life, with a new story to tell, this movie works very well and the acting is superb. Needless to say the kung fu is also top notch. Well done!
B002VWNIAY|5.0|A classic film.  I couldn't wait to open the package to watch it.  Even after so many years it still impresses me.  My copy arrived in perfect condition.  Great service.

B004SEUJ82|5.0|&#34;The Boy in the Striped Pajamas&#34; is atypical of a holocaust film in that it is told primarily through the eyes of Bruno, the eight-year-old son of a German soldier. When we first meet Bruno and his family, they are living a seemingly happy life in Berlin. However, when Bruno's father receives a promotion, they move to a farm in the countryside, next to what we soon discover is a concentration camp. His father has been chosen as commandant of that camp.<br /><br />Unlike in Berlin, where Bruno had multiple playmates and was free to run around with them, in the country he is alone (except for his family) and confined to their yard. However, a born adventurer, he finds a way to escape his yard and is soon at the perimeter of the concentration camp, where he meets a youth of his age, a boy who (as Bruno sees it) wears striped pajamas.<br /><br />The film does an extremely effective job of showing us this segment of the world through the eyes and thought-patterns of an eight-year-old child, a child who wants to believe that his father is a good man, even a hero, but who can't quite square this with what he sees, as he witnesses the &#34;farmers&#34; on the other side of the fence working in their &#34;pajamas,&#34; as he watches the smoke from the chimneys inside the camp and smells the putrid odor they give off, and as he learns from his &#34;playmate&#34; about the people in the camp who have mysteriously disappeared.<br /><br />Even in his home he receives conflicting messages. His father and mother both show love and affection to him; yet, his father and the solider boyfriend of his older sister treat with contempt the Jewish concentration-camp inmate who must work long hours for them while having almost nothing to eat, and who is severely beaten for the smallest infraction.<br /><br />To the end, Bruno seemingly ignores the obvious, or, perhaps better put, tries to square the discordant data with a positive assessment of the life of the people on the other side of the fence, including the boy in the striped pajamas. Even though Bruno is just eight years old, one might wonder how he could continue to turn a blind eye toward the unmistakable horror of what is going on. In a sense, Bruno becomes a metaphor for the German people of the Nazi era, many of whom ignored as best they could what was happening and reinterpreted the data in a way that permitted them to claim ignorance.ide of the fence, including the boy in the striped pajamas.

I hope they keep it coming.<br />ALL of the actors are wonderful.<br />However, Louis is the best.  He is so<br />smart, pitiful, insecure, despicable.  Love it.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Such a disappointing end to the otherwise excellent trilogy. I wish I hadn't read this book. I would have been better off using my imagination to decide how it all ended. I won't be buying the Four series now as a result of this book. I'm done giving money for something so ridiculous.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. My son loved it. We played together. Gave us a challenge. Made him think and keep looking g for new clues.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Replaced a G35 with this after many years of good service. Ultimately it feels like an upgraded version of the old wired headset. It's lighter, more comfortable, the headband is sturdier as well. The sound quality is identical, which is impressive considering it is wireless. The battery life is slated for 8-9 hours of gameplay, although I find that it generally lasts about 4-6 depending on volume and microphone use. The range is pretty decent too. My room is in the basement, and I can walk upstairs and use the fridge and microwave on my headset usually okay, but if it does disconnect, it can't reconnect until I'm in somewhat close range again. Not a big deal, don't buy this if you plan to walk all around the house though.<br /><br />That is all perfect, but it's all fundamentally flawed because of the issues I have with the wireless connectivity. I have a couple issues. First, the headset disconnects far too frequently in the middle of use. I'll be mid conversation and then the audio will entirely cut out, then there will be a beep, and it turns back on. It happens about once every two hours. Annoying, but not broken. I've yet to emulate this issue on my Mac, so I'm not sure if its an issue with my drivers on my Windows 7 PC or what, I've updated them to no improvement.<br /><br />There is a far worse issue though, and I've yet to troubleshoot exactly what it is. During the middle of a session every once in a while a quiet persistent electrical whine will sound, growing in volume until its unbearable, and then the headset will shut off. When you try to turn it back on, the screech will come back and it automatically shuts off. At first I thought it might be the batteries dying, because the Logitech software seemed to indicate no battery life. Then the issue would happen while it was plugged in too, so it shouldn't be battery. I tried plugging it into a AC USB adapter too, which charged it fine, but the issue still happened. It even happened on my Mac once. The headset remains unusable, but I'll come back to it a day later and it works just fine. It's like it got a headache and just doesn't want to work until it passes. It's extremely strange, it feels like some weird software glitch. I'm working with Logitech support but they have no answers yet.<br /><br />I still give this headset a 4 star, because it's awesome besides the problems I'm having. I'm assuming that my issue is isolated, but if you're a potential buyer, keep note of the other reviews, and if a lot of people seem to be having similar issues, maybe it's not worth the 4 star rating.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game and I'm so happy it's finally available on my Kindle. Only giving 4 stars because one of the levels on Kindle had a different goal than my IPhone?! Confusing but still fun.
B005DD7H50|5.0|I knew nothing about this movie, and loved the theme.  It was facinating and makes you think if you only had the limitless power of your brain.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I haven't read the book yet.  But I love most of her novels, and I am a big Scarpetta fan.
B003SI6C4O|5.0|A fascinating movie with the added benefit of being a thriller and how one slight things could alter the seqence of events.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|OMG! Fantastic, phenomenal, unbelievable. I could not stop reading with the professional narration: his voice was dramatic and very convincing.  I felt like each character, and the suspense kept me on edge.  The professional narration put &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; on an another dimension of reading of a  very good, no, grate novel.  You, everyone who enjoys reading suspense novels,  have to get this book by Stephen King.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Love James Bond movies, this was not a let down it was the expected action movie I look for in a James Bond film.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE LAST VERSION! Graphics are top but crowns are very needed for important things so in the beginning don't use them up to speed up processes....(wish someone else would have written this in a review)
B005LAII12|3.0|The movie was not what I expected but it made a great gift to another, So, I really dont have any complaints
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|LOVED THIS BOOK!! I can't wait for the next one to come! Gideon and Eva are going to last forever!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I love all of his works and have read all of his books. He has a great story line. Great writer
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Once I started playing it was so much fun but so addictive. I just want to keep getting to the next level!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|AMAZING! Buy yourself one of these now. If you watch Hulu, Netflix, Google Play, or YouTube this is the best streaming player out there. And it's a great bang for your buck. Works very well any tv with an HDMI port. Use your smartphone or tablet as a remote which is extremely convenient. Amazing product!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I recommend this game to every one! I like it because I love minecraft and it gives my brother and sister something to do.<br />GET THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00FEN000S|3.0|I thought this was going to be better than it was......It was OK.  If you're looking for an action movie &#34;fix&#34; and this is the only thing you haven't seen - then SEE it.  SEE it for sure - but just don't get your hopes up so high that you're expecting to see a movie that you want to see time and time again because it &#34;t'aint&#34; gonna happen.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game I thought it was going to be really retarded but it is actually really fun and not dumb at all
B0018STVHQ|3.0|After seeing The Tudors and  other movies that deal with this issue and time period this was mediocre at best.  It's one of those shows you don't mind saying you saw...ONE TIME&#62;  But I wouldn't want to see it twice.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Would be better but it kinda sucks that u hav to keep spending and spending money...REAL money  and a lot of it
B00EY7MFKS|5.0|I love Thor and most of the Marvel shows so this is just another &#34;fix&#34; for me.  If you like any of the Marvel movies you should like this as well.  SEE IT!
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|I just have to say it five stars.<br />Basically, this is really for the new generation. of Course we knew what the older version looked like, but this just makes it better.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|This is the second Star Trek movie by JJ Abrams and this and the previous JJ Abrams movie are both EXCELLENT.  They are far far better than any of the original Star Trek Movies so don't let that dissuade you from seeing them.  The stories are GREAT, the special affects are fabulous and the casting is perhaps the best i've EVER seen in my life.  Whoever did this casting deserves an Academy Award for finding just the right actors for each of these time honored parts - i mean not everyone can play the part of Spock or Captain Kirk and pull it off.  This cast pulled this off PLUS.  I highly recommend it.
B00FHEP9XM|5.0|Best keyboard I've ever used. Totally worth it. I'm glad I bought.<br /><br />If you are in doubt between swift key and Swype, I suggest that you buy Swype.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|I liked the characters in this story line, unpredictable and yet predictable, they had you guessing what they would think of next. The story plot was interesting, made you rethink..things happen for a reason...
B0086449YA|4.0|I really like the music by Mark Knopfler and this CD does not disappoint.  The songs are good and the playing, as always, is superb. Not he only reason I'm not giving it four stars is because of Mark's singing, which at times seems more of a mumble and the words are not easy to pick out.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Because it never ends, every time there is a update it adds more levels.Candy crush saga is a very addicting game.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Install took a customer service call. At highest resolution it loses connection frequently. At lower res it works OK. Not bad for release 0.0.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|it's fun and engrossing  i have always played free cell on my computer, so kindle is just more of the same
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book personally is the best book out of the series, is amazing with a good ending. Very social, and heart touching.
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|I really wanted to like this book. The beginning was intriguing, and I loved reading about a more mature heroine. I loved college, so reading about university life, the library and the research, brought back fond memories of my past.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Diana's mentality changes into that of a 12 year old when she meets Matthew, and the book went downhill from there. She went from a strong, self-sufficient role-model of a modern woman to an insecure, needy, clingy, insufferable excuse of a female. She is being carried away, nurtured back to health, carried away some more, ... Coming to think about it, the whole middle of the book there is zero action on her part other than laying around and waiting to be taken care of and told what to do. By Matthew. Cause he's in charge.<br /><br />Towards the end, there is a bit more action, but even that could not  save this book in my eyes.<br /><br />Some things that made me dislike \\"A Discovery of Witches\\":<br />- Dragging this adult book into the YA domain by having two adults who are into each delay intercourse. This was not believable and just bothered me. I kept thinking that if the author wanted to avoid describing sex scenes, she could just employ the 60s movie tactic and let them have sex outside of the readers' view. It's not like YA reades will suffer through all the scientific and historical descriptions and neverending quotes of poetry and songs - at times in two languages, for good measure - anyway! It was too much. Just too much.<br />- Matthew considers himself married to her, and so they are married. Matthew's \\"son\\" consequently becomes her son. That was beyond ridiculous.<br />- She has to obey Matthew in all matters, now that she is his \\"wife\\". Where is the strong person she was in the beginnig of the book?<br /><br />I just could not wait for this book to be over, and the only reason I kept reading was the wonderful beginning. I am torn  between 2 and 2.5 stars, so I'll give it 2 for now. Too bad, it could have been a great book. As it was, though, it just infuriated me to no end.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Great show, LOVE how it stays super current with using technology in the show even though it is not a &#34;tech&#34; show!  The actors have great depth and the writing is superb, love the legal quandaries that come up and the innovative way they are solved.  Definitely recommend watching from Season 1 Episode 1 to current! :)
B004SIP8BG|5.0|One of over 600 TRUE martial arts movies in my collection. This movie is stunning on so many levels, the photography, the scenery, the music even the story and plot twist are a true work of art. If you have never seen a martial Arts movie before this one would surely be the one to hook you in on Asian Cinema. Beautifully done and a wonderfully written.
0767919408|5.0|bryson is up to his old tricks again - teriffic story telling and lots of threads to tie it all together.  i look forward to every new release from him and this 1 didn't let me down.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally my favorite game for the kindle fire!! The app works great, and I haven't had any issues with it. woop!
1476734941|3.0|This diet would probably work IF I used it. I can't seem to get myself in that mode. I'm still hopeful I will use it and be successful.
B00632HWOG|2.0|I continually get errors or Yahoo sends an error that it can't connect since I loaded the new email program.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|A deep south court battle. Right in Grisham's wheelhouse. Does not disappoint. A great story that had me guessing all the way to the finish.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|My kids love it they all ways ask me can I play my game when they are bored and the more entertained they are the less mess I have to take care of
B00GOQ9M4O|1.0|Did the writers of this episode forget to do their homework and turned in their kid's work instead?  It's been what, 2 YEARS since the epidemic and these fools don't even know how to take down a zombie.  I'm sorry but Charles Darwin would roll over in his grave at the idea. Can you say &#34;survival of the fittest&#34;!?! Season 4 and this episode in particular has been a huge disappointment. Such a waste!
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|Just horrible, the directing and writing was lacking any kind of sustenance. Felt all the character connections were forced and things happened all too conveniently. Superman isn't a piece of art, he's a comic book that should be fun.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|It was a cute movie.  Since I'm at the age where friends are having kids at a rapid rate it was funny and relatable.
B000FCKC4C|2.0|I don't know if something was lost in translation, but I found it rather tedious and preachy. It did not engage me at all.
B00GIY5OGC|4.0|I enjoy watching animated movies with my children and thought this was a really good and fun movie. I would highly recommend this for adults who have children under 10.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|This is a great movie, really cute, with of course a good message. Jim Carrey and Steve Carell are really fun and have great voices for these parts.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great follow up to a Time to Kill. As always loved the characters in the story. Enjoyed the story itself, everyone has experienced this<br />in some form when a family member passes and how it unmasks other family members. Couldn't put it down, Great !
1416955070|5.0|I LOVE these books.  I've read them before and wanted to order copies of my own.  They arrived in great condition.  I'm so excited to read them again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great boredom buster. Waiting for lives and episode tickets is a little annoying but over all fun and passes the time..
B004TI5N38|5.0|The action is non-stop and the ending is a surprise.  David Baldacci is up on his game with this story.  If you like action, suspense and wondering what is going to happen next, this is the book for you .  Once you start reading the story, it is hard to put down.  But the best thing I can say is just read and enjoy.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|It has lots of action but the plot is weak. It is fine for a free movie but I would not pay much for it.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Main story and sub-plots are well written and dramatized; however, there are some &#34;not so good&#34; facets to The Good Wife. Surprise sexual encounters and multiple power plays pepper each episode. Consequences for poor decisions parallel actions, but, as in most entertainment venues, consequences are glossed.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Awesome game....love the changes, I wish I could bring my zynga account game into play but it was cool just having it mobile......!
B005MLOKXA|4.0|The saga continues with more sex and more power struggles. Stakes keep getting higher and the price characters pay to stay apace grow heftier.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book really is the new generation's \\"Catcher in the Rye.\\" Whether you are young or old, Charlie and his letters will creep into your heart.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|If you are looking for an awesome app then your IN the right place terraria is so awesome get the app
B00C5R7B0I|1.0|The worst of the series.  Mind-numbing detail that is entirely unnecessary. IT IS NOT WORTH FIFTEEN WORDS - TERRIBLE, WORTHLESS, UNREADABLE, A WASTE OF TIME - DON'T BUY
0062107313|1.0|I may echo some of the other comments, but this book is too repetitive, tedious, plodding.  Was this book edited at all???  For example, do we really need an entire chapter(&#34;Etiquette for Beauties of the Boudoir&#34;)on what was deemed necessary for the courtesan in old Shanghai?  The young girl, Violet, is completely unlikable and disagreeable.  Her treatment of Magic Gourd, for example, is reprehensible.  I found the use of anglicized(I assume this is what Ms. Tan was doing) very distracting because of the choice of names: Cracked Egg, Loyalty Fang. Magic Gourd. Really???  In a review from The New York Times, the reviewer states &#34;...in an unexpected plot twist Violet is left behind.&#34;  Did anyone truly believe that the despicable Mr. Fairweather was  sincere in his efforts to make the arrangements for the  tickets for Violet and her mother?  It was so obvious to me, pages before it happened,  that he was going to trick Lulu Mimi.  I have not finished reading this novel, but so far, I am not at all impressed with the book, and I would not recommend it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|BACK TO HIS PREMIER NOVEL - &#34;A TIME TO KILL&#34; GRISHAM IS BACK TO THE LITERARY STYLE THAT FIRST PROPELLED HIM TO STARDOM
0425263924|5.0|Awesome series if you loved Fifty Shade of Grey you will love Crossfire Series ....I just wish the author will release the books quicker
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|I've stopped playing since the game is stuck at error message to 'run update' on Kindle Fire Hd 7\\". When i've selected run update 3 choices come up, amazon store, google chrome or silk. I've tried all 3 without success. Anyway got tired of my Amazon locked device and decided to sell it in order to get a galaxy tab or Ipad air. GOOD LUCK.
0316204366|5.0|I love being asked to think about things differently and no one suggests alternative ways to see things like MG.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I can see this book being made into a movie. Looking forward to the follow up series to this. Definitely a believable story. Will recommend this to all my friends.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Had a blast finding all the items and having to use them in a specific sequence in order to escape. :)
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I loved this book! I'm thankful it wasn't some self-help book that gives you 10 new things to try to weave into your life. Instead, it gets at the heart of the issues that women face in choosing how to live their lives, and then gives them the freedom to make that choice themselves. As someone who is exploring the decision about work and children, it was great to read more about the issues that affect that choice and to be challenged to see things in a different light. We all come from different backgrounds, cultures, etc. that affect how we view the role of a woman. I think this is a book that encourages women to embrace their lives regardless of where they find themselves in life. It is obviously geared towards women who are wanting a career, but brings up important issues for any woman, from house wives to those in executive leadership roles in a corporation. I definitely recommend this book to everyone, both men and women, at least as a start of a conversation regardless if you agree with everything.
B004LSJCJM|4.0|Great blues/rock. The recording work is fantastic! It's crisp and distinctive. You'll want to crank it up every time! Excellent!!!
B00A0R0CG0|5.0|The kids watch this movie over and over, and we all laugh at the improbably near misses and surprise rescues. The squirrel and the acorn remind me of some old cartoons. But of course, we can't help but be charmed by the mastodon family. Colorado is mammoth and mastodon discovery center, and it is fun to go from the cartoon movie to the science museum and continue getting to know these animals that once walked the earth.
B002APU580|5.0|I've watched this move so many times and each time I fall in love all over again - with everyone! One of my go-to movies if I need something guaranteed to put a smile on my face!

B007IXWL2C|4.0|FINALLY! Lol<br />What can I say? I didn't hate it, but I'm glad to be finished this trilogy. Anastasia and Christian got there happy ending, while we the readers got closure to this couple's journey. I definitely think their story could've been done hundreds of pages ago, as opposed to being dragged out. I'm happy with the ending and believe all fans of the previous books will be as well. Biggest complaint: the whole storyline with Jack Hyde was presented as this big part of the story but really fell flat. It was all very anticlimactic and without that, there wasn't much of a plot other than reading about Ana and Christians daily life.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|this clever gadget has had many faults found with it but it works very well for me when i want to stream youtube videos to my telly. this device is very easily worth it's purchase price and i promise you it's very easy to set up since it actually does most of the work.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can not wait to c the movie now and am starting the next book  am so excited to c how it ends
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is great, and works fine. Any issues were due to Amazon being slow in releasing the update, that isn't Zyngas fault. This game is very fun, but terribly addicting. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.
B004Q3UL2O|2.0|My husband and I rented this movie as it was touted as a &#34;romantic comedy&#34;. It is that for about the first half, then it turns into a romantic tragedy. My husband was really upset as it turned sad, definitely not funny. Anne Hathaway fans will be pleased with her performance though. Two stars for us.
B00AQCMK32|5.0|One of the funnest games I have ever played; nothing about it is bad! Great game Kairosoft, I have been playing it non-stop for a long time now!
B00B0LPWU6|2.0|I wanted to like this movie, and I did think the overall filming and storytelling was good. The story was depressing and the characters gave little reason for the viewer to have compassion for them.
0545259088|5.0|I read all of this series and would recommend it to anyone!!  It is a different take on Werewolves and it was refreshing to see a different side of an old tale.
B002GORUF6|5.0|What a great movie. It's a classic comedy, acting and writing. If you are looking for a smile, this movie delivers.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|This is an engaging book, but I agree with others who say it lacks depth and character development that would make it more memorable. I've read most of Gaiman's longer prose (with the exception of the Anansi Boys, which I hated), and while I think this is good, I was anticipating something more considering it was meant for adults. This is closer in style to The Graveyard Book than to American Gods or Neverwhere. Having said that, it's still a good read.
B00F0N7JUG|5.0|1 of my top best 3D movies ever!! Seen it in the IMAX when it came out & wow, we'll done del toro 4 making this movie 4 us to enjoy! I got a movie room with 7.1 surround, 3D projector, movie chairs & a wall covered in pacific rim toys & posters, checking daily 2 see if there is anymore news if legend & warner brothers give up another 190million so we can watch the 2nd installment, fingers crossed!!!

B00CDV6WDS|4.0|tiles are small and hard to see some times<br />good game choices and variety<br />very addictive if you are not careful
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|Great movie, my grandson has watched this at least a dozen times and still asks for it. It is also fun for the adults.
B00FEHXISA|1.0|The movie was terrible and the constant buffering made it had to enjoy. The plot was totally stupid, the special effects were great but that's it
B0025WX2YW|5.0|I really enjoyed Season 1, and I had no doubt that I would love Season 2!  I adore Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Henry Cavill!
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|The book was easy and enjoyable reading,  the positive outlook that Malala has is inspirational and due to her personality, and the incredible support she has through her family, good girlfriends, and her close community.<br /><br />The details of what happened when Malala got shot really puts the reader right there in the situation,  very well done.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I love the actors and actresses!  Always been fascinated about King Henry VIII from history classes.  Glad to have viewed this!!

B00AESN8XY|5.0|You know what the game has zombies zombies zombies and more zombies I love it so much I would have bought this game for the world and I am in love with it.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|War Horse, in my opinion, is an incredible movie.  Granted, this movie is difficult to watch for those of us who have more empathy for animals than most humans, but the scenery, the acting, the storyline are superb!  Jeremy Irvine was spectacular in his breakout role, Tom Hiddleston was beyond incredible, and the rest of the main cast were great as well.  Keep the tissues handy, this movie will make you cry.
B008200LHW|1.0|I have been able to find a mapping or maine charting program it is compatible with. Rather disappointing can not recommend.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Already purchased the next book! I can't wait to start reading it tomorrow.  Who would have guessed that ending! Outstanding
B008JFUO4U|2.0|So here's the spoiler warning, because I'm not going to try to not talk about aspects of the movie, so, if you think, like me, that the movie looks cool and you're probably going to watch it anyway despite what I say (just don't do it. really), you shouldn't read this. If you want to know about all of the dumb (you should!), read on.<br /><br />I realize this isn't an issue for some people, but it is for me, as I've mentioned before: The movie did that opening narration thing to explain what's going on. I'm convinced that opening narration is almost always a bad thing. If you have to have it, you have either (1) started your movie in the wrong place (2) failed to provide information within the movie in a way that works for the viewer. The Star Wars movies are one of the few places where you can find effective opening narration (in the form of the prologue scroll). And, then, not only did Oblivion open with the narration providing the viewer with an out-of-character monologue of events, but all of that same information was provided about halfway through the movie in almost exactly the same format. Please, do not provide me the same information more than once in your movie. I can almost guarantee you that I got it the first time (which is why I tell my kids to not repeat themselves when they do something they find funny: I did just see it happen).<br /><br />Despite the opening narration, the movie doesn't make much sense. Ostensibly, Jack and Victoria are a team placed on Earth to defend these large fusion reactors, but, really, why are they needed? There's actually no good reason for them to be there. Sure, sure, he's some technician who has to repair the drones, but that's flimsy at best, because that whole set up is just to support the fact that they want this character that doesn't have any memories, but from any kind of logical standpoint, it doesn't make any sense. I mean, it might (almost) make sense if the stated premise of the movie was true, but you know it's not, because, even if it was, what would be the point of erasing the memories of the support teams? However, with the knowledge that the aliens are really in charge, there is absolutely no good reason to have things set up the way they are. Why do they need humans to repair their drones? And why, after the Jack clones fought for them as their army when they took over the Earth, do they need to trick the clones into believing they're normal humans anyway?<br /><br />Then there's the problem of Jack having this whole wilderness retreat that he's built, somehow, without anyone finding out. He's able to just turn off the tracking unit in his (what I'm calling) dragonfly ship (which  is very cool, by the way) and go &#34;off comm.&#34; What the heck? His navigator person (who never leaves &#34;the tower&#34;) doesn't have any idea where he is when he does this and neither do the aliens. Seriously? They just allow him to go off and do secret things without bothering to know what he's up to. Completely implausible. Sure, it makes sense if you believe the story as it's presented at the beginning of the movie, but, again, you know that's not the whole story fairly quickly, and the idea that the aliens (or whatever) would just allow this is beyond imagining. It's what the writer/director do to support the lie and get the audience to buy into it, but those things need to make sense after the truth is revealed, too.<br /><br />Jack has these dreams... dreams of being in New York before it was destroyed, but that was 50 or so years ago, and he's not that old. My wife kept joking about them being &#34;clone dreams&#34; because, at that point, we were trying to go along with what the movie was telling us. Trying. But we both knew she was right. Right in that being what the movie was going to say they were: memories of Jack's life before he was cloned by the aliens. Seriously? This isn't the 80s anymore, and we already knew in the 80s, even in sci-fi, that clones don't get the memories of the being they were cloned from. The memory flashes work if his mind really was &#34;wiped&#34; before his mission, but it doesn't work as some remnant from his genetic donor. It's just dumb. Why can't we seem to get past this stupid idea that clones have the memory of whatever they were cloned from? (And, again, I just have to point out that Star Wars does not do this, the only sci-fi clone movie I can think of that doesn't fall back on that tired idea.)<br /><br />Also, the drones, which can follow Jack's &#34;DNA trail&#34; (really? we leave a trail of DNA in the atmosphere even when we're in an enclosed, airtight vessel?) have a problem with his voice identification and consider killing him more than once. I suppose they can't sense his DNA when he gets too close. That's only a long-range thing. (Do you sense the sarcasm there?)<br /><br />And there's the bit where the drones are flying through the human hideout blasting everyone into cinders but, when one of them corners Jack's wife, Julia (introduced only to be a princess-in-the-tower character), and a bunch of other humans in a dead-end corridor, it pauses and decided to scan them. Again, really? The drone, programmed to kill humans, suddenly needs to stop and scan them? For just long enough for it to get exploded from behind, of course.<br /><br />And, after all of that, we're not even up to the stupidest part of the movie. I know! I see your jaws hanging. The stupidest part is when he finally flies up to the alien ship, this huge, upside-down pyramid thing, and it's just full of vast expanses of space on the inside! When did this become a thing and what kind of sense does it make? So, yeah, he's flying through this huge space and, every once in a while, he has to fly through an opening in a wall, and the walls are covered in clone pods. The only other things in the huge alien space ship are drones. No aliens. And, when he finally gets to the center to arrive at &#34;Sally,&#34; it's just anotherinverted pyramid thing with a flashing (talking?) red light. NO ALIENS! So tell me why they needed to take over the Earth and use it as a source of material for their fusion reactors IF THERE ARE ACTUALLY NO ALIENS? And, if that's all they needed, why didn't they just stop at any of the unpopulated planets on the way into the solar system? Wouldn't that have been so much easier than having to fight a bunch of humans for the materials they wanted? AND WHERE WERE THE ALIENS?<br /><br />There was also an even more stupidest part. The part where somehow the flight recorder from Jack's spaceship from when he first got captured by the alien ship went from being in the command module, recording what was happening, to being in the sleeping quarters of the ship even though the sleeping portion had been jettisoned. Because that makes all the sense.<br /><br />The acting, though, wasn't bad. Not great but not bad, either. And the tech was decently cool. But there was a reason (many of them, actually, as I've pointed out) the movie didn't make back its production budget domestically. So, unless you just have to prove to yourself how dumb the movie is, this is not one I could suggest to anyone.
B008469DGY|2.0|Frustrating.  Difficult to gauge distance.  I don't play it because I don't like it.  I think this was free...good thing.
B00AEBBA9U|5.0|There are so many lines in this movie that are amazing.  The acting is meant to be melodramatic - a great look into the what stars went through from silent to talkies.
B0073QYC2G|5.0|Very pleased with this item. It is for my nephew. Often times the Schelich Dinosaurs do not give you any size dimensions. This one is large and has a movable jaw. Looks as pictured. I think my nephew will be thrilled.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I'm sick in bed and I couldn't put this book down! I laughed so hard at times. I love how it's from the guy's perspective. This book is raw, hot, and downright hilarious! I can't wait for the next installment! Must read!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This book surely will shake up some people and maybe it's best if you finish the last chapters in privacy so no one can bother you. I just simply couldn't stop readying!
B00E8S2KV2|5.0|Awesome!!! This is a great movie one that you can keep watching over and over! So why not buy it so you can watch it whenever you want!
0937381888|5.0|The 'bible' for home brewers. It simply gives you all you need (and more) on how to become a excellent home brewer. Tip: just do ALL of what he says in the book!
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|Great xmas movie for all ages! Great family movie for kids and adults! Buy it! Get in the xmas spirit!
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|Fun, challenging, yet not as stressful as some other bubble games.Some of the bubble colors are very close to others which can be a little difficult, but still fun.
0679805273|5.0|Great book! Great gift for someone graduating! Who does not like Dr. Seuss. Love this book for all ages, buy!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|fast enjoyable read............the town and characters were familiar from the first book, with interesting glimpses of the power of judges.
1419707663|5.0|Great series and my son loves the books cant keep his nose out of them!!! Great collectors too! Buy for boys or girls!
B00BPDR3F6|1.0|Interesting, but why read about unpleasant happenings.<br />I orderd the book, because of rave reviews and wish someone had steered me clear of it.
B004HD61KE|4.0|As always, James Rollins blows things up really well.  I am sorry Doctor, but more character development would greatly improve the Sigma folks.  I have been to some of these Native American places so I had a good idea what the location looked like.  Could have used a bit more description for others who have not seen these 'general' locations.  Please continue writing and I will definitely continue to read your works!

B00992CF6W|3.0|Although I can play games on my Kindle, I can't download or read books on it.  Amazon has really let me down.
B00005JMCW|5.0|Funny, Funny, Funny!!  Jamie Lee Curtis and Linsay Lohan are a perfect combination for this classic movie.  Entertainment the whole family can enjoy.
B0017SWPXY|1.0|The book is probably fine.  But, my Kindle will not download or allow me to read books.  Amazon technicians keep promising that the &#34;technical division&#34; will be in touch with me to fix the problem, but they never are.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoy the game. There are multiple challenges in each floor. Anyone who likes hidden object games will like this.

B00E9ZATTY|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. What's great about Pixar and Disney is they do a great job of making the movie enjoyable for both children and adults. As a big fan of Monsters Inc., I was excited to see how pals Mike and Sully started out.<br /><br />The Blu-ray comes with hours of special features that take you behind the scenes of how they created the story, the animation and more. It makes you want to be a member of the Pixar team!<br /><br />If you are a fan of other Pixar/Disney movies such as Cars or Finding Nemo, you certainly won't be disappointed with this movie. Its not necessary to see the original Monsters Inc to watch this movie but I think it would help you appreciate Monsters University even more!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I loved the first two books, but this one was such a let down. It was as if the author just gave up. First two were absolutely amazing and I was so excited for this one to come out. Way to ruin a series! I hope they change this story line for the movie.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|It's so addicting! I'd rather be &#34;playing&#34; this app than any of my other apps and I'm amazed at how much I'm learning and retaining!!!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Intelligently written.  The author clearly explains his thesis and provokes a critical analysis of the nature of organized religion and divinity itself.
0066620996|5.0|It lives up to its reputation.  It is a great book with great documentation about how other companies achieved and maintained success.
B00E8UKY3Q|5.0|Reviews should be limited when it comes down to movies that are made for children. This movie was very engaging and it satisfied my kids to the fullest.  The movie was excellent, so to review movies of this caliber, it is grossly unfair. Leave reviews for movies that truly require it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is the game I can play over and over again.  Some time I have to do the game over, but I don't mind the challenge it is just so much fun.  I am hooked on Candy Crush Saga.  Thanks for making me so Happy!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Love the book. Love Clare. Love the series. Can't wait to continue with the other books she has written, all amazing I'm sure.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I love this game and its great and all but try to come up with your own ideas (minecraft)<br />no hard feelings
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|Why did they make this!? Oh yea, MONEY. What a let down. I have nobody to blame but myself. I knew it would be bad, but I loved the 1st one so much, I figured 'how bad could it be' - I want to sue Bradley Cooper for $4.99.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game it is so much Fun!!!!!Awesome!  Play this if you want a good laugh and a good time passer.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Excellent, I couldn't put it down.  It a very touching,sad story.Hard to believe people had to endure such pain and anguish.
B00ESNDQWY|5.0|Love it. The acting, the production quality the content and the topics are all good on this show. You need to watch this!
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Couldn't put this down!  Proper and grotesque all at the same time.  The movie with Gary oldman bad winona Ryder followed the book fairly closely.
0375707972|5.0|Emotionally charged in the first third of the book, the reader is set up for the remaining pages in which the author delivers an emotionally charging rendition of how to feel sorry for a Nazi. This book slants the angle.  Review is of choice.  This is not aa &#34;Sophie’s Choice&#34;, a choice where the Nazis are so evil as to deliver a Solomon’s decision to a mother.  Instead, this is about the choice of a young woman in Nazi Germany. And, from that choice she becomes one of the Nazis stereotypically denounced in American literature – but not in this German account.<br /><br />This is more than a book about Nazis, it is a book about how the peers of the Nazis could be sucked into the debilitating social structure and end up being cast as a monster through innocent human error.<br /><br />The front and back of this book are classic opposites: young forlorn lover – old and withered woman; in control over narrator – at the mercy of the narrator; mystical woman – simpleton; and full of life – mature cynicism.<br /><br />Sometimes, when reading the foreign books translated into English, I only wonder why less translations are made.  The foreigners reads translations almost 20% of the time – Americans are less than 1%, and a majority of those are Spanish works.  To the publishers of this novel, I applaud their financial risk in delivering this novel to my English-reading eye.<br /><br />Two decades removed from arguably society’s lowest reading on the moral compass, Germany – through the eyes of the narrator – seems as deadened as a zombie-town in an American B-movie.  Everyone remembers, and few seek to discuss, what had happened.<br /><br />Even in translation, writing skills surface. “After a time I thought I could detect a similar numbness in other people. Not in lawyers, who carried on throughout the trial with the same rhetorical logistic pugnacity, jabbing pedantry, or loud, calculated truculence, depending on their personalities and their political standpoint.” “All survival literature talks about the numbness, in which life’s functions are reduced to a minimum, behavior becomes completely selfish and indifferent to others, and gassing and burning are everyday occurrences.”<br /><br />And, those are merely a few passages of this oftentimes eerie account.political standpoint.” “All survival literature talks about the numbness, in which life’s functions are reduced to a minimum, behavior becomes completely selfish and indifferent to others, and gassing and burning are everyday occurrences.”<br /><br />And, those are merely a few passages of this oftentimes eerie account.
B002RI9K5Y|2.0|I  found the book  exceedingly  depressing.  Well  written,  and  so on  but  after  the first  few  chapters I had  had  enough.
0316228532|5.0|I initially heard very mixed reviews about this book, but being a Harry Potter fan, I had to see what J.K. Rowling's non-Harry work was like. She did not disappoint! Many of the characters are easy to relate to and the story captures the struggles of people of all different ages, which makes the book that much more interesting. I read this book over six months ago and I still find myself wondering what happened to some of the characters.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Learnt a lot the experiment were really fun to do. It opened a different way of looking at the world around....
159463176X|5.0|I love all of Khaled Hosseini's work. He has such a great knack for storytelling and tying in how different cultures and experiences affect people. This is no exception.
1400052181|5.0|Great story, extremely well written. I now see her name all over; before I read this I had never heard of her.
0374214913|4.0|Great book! Even more interesting than I was expecting. I would recommend reading it. It has an interesting sci-fi element to it that I wasn't expecting.
B000B7HZXM|5.0|I love these songs.  Rod Stewart sings the old songs so well.  I listen to it all the time when I'm working around the house.
B00G32QIEG|2.0|Very glad I didn't pay for two tickets to see this movie in the theater. It is a badly written retread of &#34;Men in Black&#34;.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Very entertaining. This is a great game with nice graphics, interesting  puzzles.  I really enjoy all of the G 5 games.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addicting game and I love it! Very amazing game! But I hate the lost game with crying to be waited for another minutes for a life game!
1451627297|4.0|Wonderful story if you can ignore the lone gunman conclusion sold throughout the book by Mr King. However spoiler alert . The ending is awful. I think Mr King had no idea how to end the book and came up with the most ridiculous conclusion to what could have been a wonderful book. Great characters great bedtime read but of no historical significance. Enjoyed the book however but Mr Kings support of the lone gunman conclusion is present throughout the entire book.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Brings back childhood memories. Great story line bringing back those memorable characters from The Shining!! Another great story from an awesome author.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Our entire family loves to play this simple game! The kids share the Kindle or my phone beautifully and cheer each other on too!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Really smooth experience. Setup is quick and simple, and then the YouTube app on Android just works with it. Easy for multiple people to join in, adding things to the queue. I've used it several times for watching YouTube with friends and family, or for queueing up background music while we're playing games.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Always a fun game to play! I like that it saves where I left off. My 10 year old daughter likes to play as well!
B003G4W49C|4.0|Good plot - well developed characters - interesting ending. Very deep subject matter, ie. do we have the right to eliminate a species on speculation of an impending attack?
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I wake up to it!  It was simple to download and simple to set different alarms for different days. It was a nice back-up alarm when my clock died.
1476734941|2.0|Not worth<br />Unrealistic, not easy to follow or comply with. Repeats of methods repeated throughout. Don't waist your money, not worth it
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|The kids love watching the movie on our Kindle Fire HD. Being a Prime Member it was free to watch!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Good Story line, but not riveting.  It kept me wanting to read more, but not to the point where I couldn't put the book down.  I am looking forward to seeing what the next installment brings.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|This is a good movie but fairly dark so you do not want the children to watch it.  I liked it because it is much likely the real story how Snow White fairy tail came about.  The evil queen is really well acted and all the supporting roles were well played.  Highly recommend it.
B00E72OKAS|5.0|used to play this game on the Pc but that wasn't nearly as good as this game this has tons more to do if u like upgrades, cars, and zombies this is the game for u. oh and did I forget to mention GUNS MUHHUHA
0920236251|5.0|The book came quickly, was in excellent condition and the story was very meaningful.<br />My grand-daughter and the other homeschool scouts loved it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Engulfing, as always. Stephen King once again swept me away in a fantasy world that I believed until the final page. Highly recommend for any fan.
B003DNH6DK|5.0|Great movie with great lessons.  Watched it with the kids (fast-forward thru the part when Michael runs away after the interrogation) and it led to some interesting discussion.  My kids are 9 and 11.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|It is a great time passer.  Fun to do while waiting or just relaxing.  I enjoy this game.  I would play again
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|addictive and fun.  don't have many words to say about this game, it's a game and it can become addictive.
B0017APPSE|5.0|Excellent period piece. A wonderful movie of suspense, love and intrigue.<br />The drama that takes place between the two sisters vying for the King's affection with each driven by<br />completely different motives draws the viewer in. This movie is anything but boring.
B006JRY2QG|5.0|Jax Teller, as well as the storyline. I like th fact that they involve all aspects of the outlaw biker life. Oh yeah and Jax, yum.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is great and addictive.  I am one of the older generation and since my college age grand daughter's and my daughter introduced me to the game it is difficult to out down.  I can hardly wait to see what the next level has.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|This movie was ok but I just didn't like the zombies in this movie. It was just dumb how to had to have an illness to avoid getting bit and Turing into a zombie
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Extremely well written, this book grabs you from the start and weaves together the lives of many different people in a way you couldn't imagine.  A book that encompasses friendships, marraiges, and the faults and foibles of people as they journey through thier lives. It kept you guessing until the end!
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|This movie was great it had everything from drama laughs and drugs. The special effects are great too when the plane crashes and all the pilot has to go through
0446567337|5.0|Before I read this book, I knew I would love it just because Nicholas Sparks wrote it, But, this book was different from all the other ones I read(in a good way).This book was very touching and taught throughout the book, the true meaning of love. I never once wanted to put this book down and I enjoyed reading it every second that I did! I defiantly recommend this book to teenagers and young adults!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I was absolutely heartbroken when I finished this book, I was bawling all night and it's kinda weird how you can get attached to a character, so read it and find out why I was heartbroken. Have fun!<br />-Olivia
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I am a huge Gaga fan, so I love everything she does. Recieved this CD 2 days after the release date, so that was good.
B00GFOIUVQ|5.0|I just love it is like playing in the movie graphics Amazon. Yeah the fighting control cool so everybody download this app you want regret.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I think that it's a fun game no matter what age group and will make any one happy by getting to use their creativity in the game in any way you want and I &lt;3 to play it(: !!!
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|If you're an Eagles fan.....you gotta get it!!!  Make yourself a bowl of popcorn and enjoy!  I'm even more in love with 'em.
B00C3V5TTQ|5.0|A great album from one of the greatest bands of the 1980s!  English Electric certainly rates as one of Orchestral Maneuvers In the Dark's best overall albums, and proves to the world, and their fans, that Euro-Pop is alive and well.  Too often we fans of New Wave are disappointed by 'new' material from out favorite bands that somewhere along the way lost the beat that made their music so amazing.  English Electric remains true to OMD's original sound, and so is an absolute delight to play (especially when driving on the freeway!).  The disc consists mainly of the fast-paced, danceable music we came to love most from OMD (such as that enduring favorite, &#34;Tesla Girls&#34;), with a few tunes designed for those more romantic slow dances.  Kudos to the band for staying true to their genre - and their fans - by producing such a great work!
B008JFUR10|5.0|Great plot to go along with, very well-done, 3d graphics. Finally monsters that don't look like Transformers! I paid 30 dollars and was very pleased with this purchase.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|By Grabthar's Hammer by The Suns of Warvan you shall be avenged.<br />On of my favorites. This movie is still funny even after being out since 1999.
B0063M22QO|5.0|..Very interesting way to spend your time.  Never boring..  you will get lost in the game and time will fly.
B00AEBB8YW|5.0|I know there is a lot of chatter comparing this version to the original starring Audrey Hepburn, but I saw this one first and loved it.  When I finally got around to seeing the original, I was disappointed.  Maybe it's because Audrey's portrayal of her character is a bit more selfish and air-headed, neither of which sit well with today's women.  And let's face it, Harrison Ford at this point was WAY sexier.  All the characters are strong in this movie and when you've come to the ending, you really feel as if you've experienced something special.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Good story. gets a little preachy in the ending and final chapter.  It would be interesting to see the movie now.
0812550757|1.0|Best book in the series in my opinion. Too bad that Orson Scott Card is a bigot and hates gay people. Do not support this author. Do not buy any of his books, or see any of his movies. Don't support him in any way.
B007AJFSJW|1.0|Paul Krugman is a twit.  He is so over his head in anything he opens his pie hole about but makes a living as the loyal Liberal on TV and NYT.  I cannot imagine anyone taking a class he teaches, except to get a mention in his column.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|both fun and challenging.  keeps me busy.  harder than expected. some times i have to put it down and come back to figure it out.
B005FITILO|4.0|What is there to say about the &#34;popular&#34; girl who is what she is.  Charlize plays it to the hilt and really twists it in the end.  One of those tough ones to watch in sections.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This is an Amazing TV Show!!! I recommended it!, easily one of the best shows i've seen so far! don't miss it.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|It's hard to believe either Roth or her editor let the final book in the series go to print in this condition.  Sloppy and careless in its writing, sales of her next book will surely suffer from reader anger over this one.  Practically inexplicable in its badness, it reads as if she needed the money fast and didn't have time to flesh out the outline of the book.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|Awesome movie with tons of action. My turn to watch a dude flick and this was totally bearable. Good story line, acting and humor.
1455883115|5.0|An amazing book demonstrating the use of scientific methods in human behavior, namely the historical decline of violence.  This book (or at least the last chapter which presents a summary of major concepts) is a must read for any informed person.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Wow! 2 awesome sequel movies in a year?! (ie. Ironman) I purchased both thru amazon download and wish I'd bought the hard copies for special features. Super funny, great characters (the casting person should get an Oscar).<br />Only critique: basing part of the movie on a prior movie and then DRASTICALLY changing that part seemed lame. Not a huge Trekkie so I'm not freaking too much, but I get their angst. Didn't change how awesome the movie was, so I'm sticking with 5 stars of fun.
0062255657|5.0|Gaiman is one of my favorite writers.  This is a lovely and haunting story.  The ending seemed a little rushed, but I don't care.  It's a great read.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Love, love, love. Funny, action packed. Downey delivers, please keep them coming!! Seriously, the best one yet, which is weird with sequels.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|Ok movie but it was more for a teenager or young adult taste.  The story mostly was about the teen going through all the disasters all by himself while the father tries to guides him from the wrecked space ship.
B008133MDK|5.0|Cannot stop watching! Love this series. Hope it continues for a long time. Looking forward to next ones. A must on watch list.
B003E6LC6I|5.0|this continue to be an excellent show.  it has so many sub-plots that following it requires the viewer to stay focused.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Pretty good game not sure it was worth buying to unlock<br />Will maybe play sequels when and if they come out
B00E38KGF4|5.0|Bitdefender has an excellent record and is a respected member of the antivirus group of software.  This version downloaded fast and loaded as soon as I clicked on the icon.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I personally have not played this but my grandsons love it and so do their parents. It has now become the game of first choice
0385523394|5.0|great read!!! love this story. nothing like the show, written in a serious manner. I loved both, clearly this book is more to inform where the show is made to be a comedy.
B00FRMDH7Y|5.0|Very cute movie with interesting and inspiring animated characters. My 4-year-old grandson loved it and wants to watch it again!
B00BBW15R8|5.0|I have watched this movie over and over, and it iis a true movie. Love the actors and the story line. I will watch it many more times!
081297381X|5.0|If you are deciding between this book, and &#34;Outliers&#34; by Malcolm Gladwell, get this one.  Gladwell's is basically a watered down / dumbed down version of this book.
B003LPNGWA|5.0|Great movie with great actors.  I have read the book and the movie really brings it all to life. Anne Bancroft did a great job.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|There are some things that would help make this much nicer.  First off would be to not lock down support of apps.  Let anyone make apps that work with it and it would be the best thing ever!<br /><br />Also, give it a basic browser through the app so users can enter web access credentials or click acceptance policies needed to access certain networks (hotels, coffee shops, hospitals, etc.)
B00493E1GI|5.0|Read the book first then watched the movie and loved both. I then read the second book which wasn't as good as the first. I will watch this movie over and over!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was awesome very suspenseful one of the best books I've read in a while can't wait till catching fire
B006WMILQU|5.0|Everyone  who loves this era of movies MUST watch this movie.  I gave up counting the times I have watched it. And I will again and again.
B008YU0AOE|1.0|This calculator is totally inaccurate. I have no idea how it got so flawed. I've even gotten the wrong answer to 2+2! Needless to say, I've deleted it from my device.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|I am a Denzel fan and this is a great drama. I would recommend this movie to my friends. This is a story that makes you think &#34;what if&#34;.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I absolutely love candy crush. It's hard to stop playing though. It's entertaining, fun and all of the characters are adorable!!! Get this app. Stop reading this and hit download this second. WELL GO!!!
0545603684|5.0|This alternative cover for the movie tie in version of Catching Fire does not contain any movie posters or extras that so many other novels have included when converted to film in the young adult market. The novel is the same in every regard except the beautiful alternate cover and movie promotion/basic credits.
0345803485|3.0|Every book I have ever reviewed so far, I have have at least tried to have something positive to say for it. This particular story does have some positive elements to it, such as exploration of a relatively inexperienced young womans professional, and sudden romantic experiences, with a very successful business mogul. Her apprehensions about the future, her social, professional, and political adaptations are also examined. I suppose the most compelling aspect of the book, for some, and what might recommend it to some people, is how Mr Grey takes care of the much less prosperous Alexia Steel, and how quickly their relationship turns starkly sexual, and also some what kinky, at times. This part of the book did not really impress me, and really was not too fond of the way most of the book is<br />like a young teen from the wrong side of the tracks gushing about an arranged date with the football quarterback.
B000HF6XKO|5.0|Syriana is spectacular. It's one of the most beautifully shot, well acted, complex and ambitious movies ever made. Too bad Hollywood doesn't make more movies of this artistic caliber.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I'm  really glad they brought it over for the kindle! now I can play it while waiting for classes! but not during.
B00902AKK4|5.0|Hours of entertainment. Lots of levels. Good challenge  I would recommend it.  Good for kids who like solving puzzles. My kids have really enjoyed it.

B00FEFOLKQ|5.0|Both albums that were advertised as the 'recording event of the decade' are finally out in this 20th Anniversary special edition. It's such a pleasure to hear this on my record player.<br />When these tracks were first released a lot of people complained that the recordings were made by the duet artist singing over Sinatra's track. For me, I'm just glad that I'm able to experience this and share it with my friends and family when they're over at my place.<br />Aretha Franklin, Streisand, Tony Bennett, Stevie Wonder are just a few of the 2 dozen+ artists that collaborated to create this album. There are some tracks there that I could skip over sometimes but in general it's a great setlist. The quality of the package is very impressive. As expected, 180g vinyl sounds perfect and it even includes new cover art than previous editions.<br /><br />If you're a Sinatra fan, this album should definitely be in your collection (it probably is at this point :)
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|Awesome movie!  If you love off the wall humor and if you really are a Ruth Gordon fan, you will thoroughly enjoy this movie. Towards the end, you understand Why Maude is the way she is, and it is bittersweet. It makes your own problems seem minute compared to what she has been through.  She decides that life is to be thoroughly enjoyed to the end and to bring others along for the ride.
B0045HCJT4|4.0|I’m sure that Soldier appeals to the masculine members for its violence and shoot-em-up blow-em-up visions that seem to appeal to many today. I found something else. This is of course fantasy. An infant was designated to become a soldier. He was from the beginning exposed and encouraged by violence and void of affection. I imagine in reality this child would have died long ago. In spite of all that there was something in side that made him basically good. He was confused when he landed in a caring community and  simple kindness seemed to overwhelm him. The scene that struck me was the child opening his arms for the soldier to pick him up in the end.
B00FPH3YQA|5.0|Love the series.
B000002J1M|5.0|One of the classic albums of the 70's progressive rock era. This is where Genesis stepped up to the plate and cranked out their first true masterpiece.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|The Divergent series has all the stuff of any great rollercoaster ride. The ups, downs, twists, turns, wild loops, and hairpin surprises that anyone can ask for in a completely all consuming package. Thank You Veronica Roth
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|Fun easy to play game. Great for the Can. I need to add more words apparently. Hey Amazon let us keep em short and sweet
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I have been playing this game daily and not paying for any extras. It is challenging and fun and I find myself waiting for my chance to play quests and levels! I do recommend this game but if you are impatient it will end up expensive.
B000L53D4O|4.0|Use this for when your baby can cruise unassisted. Yes, it is very lightweight and can topple over, it is best used for babies who are already walking. It's nice to have a toy that isn't electronic! We got this for our son and he has used it since he could sit up (kept it folded down), now that he can walk he pushes it all around. Again, I wouldn't recommend using this to ASSIST a baby who is pulling up and learning, because it will just topple over backwards.
B004UHL9EK|2.0|This app was useful the one time I had need of it. I was able to use the timers at an art meeting to time speed-drawing sessions.  Unfortunately, despite the fact that I've only used the app once (and that was many months ago) I continually find it running in the background on my device, even after rebooting.  I have a DROID4, which is no spring chicken of a phone, so this is unacceptable for me.  The potential uses of this app are not powerful enough to justify sacrificing device resources to keep it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I hope the movie for this one doesn't suck. The first Hunger Games movie did not do it justice at all!
B001MM28JG|5.0|Fun Fun Fun especially if you are a &#34;closet&#34; Trekkie and can take a good ribbing. It's a parody and it's also a nice bit of science fiction fluff.
1476729085|4.0|\\"The Rosie Project\\" is probably my new favorite love story. Ironically, there is very little \\"love\\" in it. At least not in the traditional sense. It was certainly no Julie Garwood or Catherine Coulter. And yet, there was so much non-traditional love, that it melted my heart.<br /><br />I found that I have many of the same qualities as the main character, Don. In fact, there were lines at the end that nearly had me in tears because it was so true to my life, and I completely understood where Don was coming from when he thought them. \\"I was not wired to feel love. And faking it was not acceptable. Not to me.\\" And then, \\"I knew so much s*** and I still couldn't fix myself.\\"<br /><br />Don is a Professor, who (most likely) has Asperger's. Though it is only hinted at through the story-telling, and subtly brought up by a supporting character, we never really know. For logical reasons, Don decides that he needs a wife, and starts working on The Wife Project. (Which, by the way, I think is bloody brilliant!) The Wife Project consists of a 30-something page questionnaire, internet dating sites, speed dating and a blind date. Throughout the book, he slowly realizes that these methods are not working and gives up on the project. It's not really giving anything away to say that Don falls for the 1 person he found wholly unsuitable, it was quite predictable just from reading the jacket. But this book wasn't really about the ending, it was how Don and Rosie get there. And that is how you get suckered in to loving the characters and their story.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Excellent Movie--Denzel Washington gives his usual stellar performance and John Goodman is a delight. Remember that it is rated R and the subject matter rather harsh and sordid at times but overall an excellent movie.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Great information. I refer to this book all the time and have recommended it to family and friends. It's for your health.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I hope to soon understand this game. I bet once I do I will surely be so addicted I won't be able to put I it down...like a good book!
B005PK56TA|5.0|Stellar acting, fantastic story line, and character development that keeps you wanting more. This series is so enthralling. It is an intelligent, creepy, and witty show that is a bit more of a psychological thriller than horror. Nonetheless, I think many will enjoy this show once given a chance. Hint - Watch from the beginning. I once tried getting into the show by watching an episode from the middle of the season and I was totally lost, lol. Watching in sequence will definitely help you to fully understand the story line and characters and their actions. Must see tv for me!

0062107313|3.0|I'm almost halfway through this, which is why I've been generous with three stars. I'm a little confused; Amy Tan wrote this, right? T-A-N? I have to keep checking the title page to make sure. Her previous books have ranked among my most favorite, but this one . . . if I see the word &#34;pudenda&#34; ONE MORE TIME I'm going to throw my Nook at someone's pudenda. I'm no prude, but if I wanted a mediocre story wrapped around throbbing this and rigid that, I would read Fifty Shades of Whatever. Tan's previous novels have been so rich with symbolism, the characters have made my heart ache with the despair of their unexpressed emotions, her descriptions, dialogue, familial strings . . . this story, so far, has none of that and just a whole lot of pudendas.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I truly enjoyed reading &#34; The Husband's Secret&#34;.  So many books are simply a rehash of an old story with different characters set in a different time, but not this one.  The storyline itself is fresh and well written.  Character development is excellent; each personality is unique and jumps off the page.  I highly recommend this book.  Well done!
B00D3PYQT0|5.0|The series is probably one of the best TV shows ever presented by PBS. Everyone should view some of the best.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Thank you Mr. Craig.<br />Good watch.<br />I wish there would have been a little more back story on how his parents died. If it was in a different Bond movie I don't remember it.<br /> And how much am I loving Javier Bardem - excellent Bond villain. Although the bleach job was a bit much. But then again, he was crazy.

1451666179|5.0|Allie Brosh is some kind of genius. Her ability to express complex concepts and life situations-- using only her Macbook touchpad (!!!)-- is a testament to this fact. She succeeds where even literature has often failed, such as in accurately capturing profound depression and nailing animal psychology.<br /><br />This book included the best of the online blog, and added some instant classics. I was happy to find that they did not recycle some of the earlier blog entries which I never found to be at quite so high a standard.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the vibrant &#34;MS Paint&#34;-type colours did not translate well at all in this print edition, resulting in a dull aesthetic compared to viewing the comic on a computer monitor. This is clearly no fault of the author's, but slightly disappointing nevertheless.<br /><br />Well worth the wait to see the new entries, and to see that Allie is (hopefully!) doing better.
B00E9A656K|5.0|Love the cars and the graphics. This game is addictive and relatively easy to play. Doesn't take forever to build up gas and money either, cars are nicely done as well
B006S8QY8K|2.0|For the most part the movie was pleasant enough. It's a typical feel good movie about a man trying to find that spark to life he didn't realize was missing. Unfortunately, due to the explicit language in the film (f-bomb, s-words, multiple a-- usage) I can't really recommend it. Not sure why it was edited that way...try seemed to come out of the blue toward the end of the film.  It could've definitely done without it and been pleasant enough.

B000NGTJTY|1.0|Confusing hard to follow and not worth the money I paid to watch it. Did not care for the flow of the movie never knew quite what was going on. Found it frustrating. And Matt Damon and Leonardo look enough alike was never quite sure if I was looking at a past event current event or future event. If they ever stream for free I may watch again.
B003PIUBZS|4.0|I like this series, it's a little heavy on the cartoon blood and not moves it plot at a snail's pace, but every episode in and of itself is very well done and very impressive.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Action packed great show. Hubby got me addicted. Love the ease of a season pass the show just shows up in my library. This show is intense gory and scary. Not family fair by any means. But once you start watching you really want to know what is next.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Seems to be working well with my kindle fire. It's fun although a little slow. The alarm is a little annoying.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|Great app. I enjoy checking the moon phase and even though it says the pictures are a simulation they are cool as well. Easy to use and fun. This is really cool.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|There have been so many suspenseful books written, it seems that writers must find it hard to come up with new suspenseful plots, where the reader doesn't anticipate the outcome.  Liane Moriarty succeeds in making a new twist, and readers are left to wonder where she will take these characters, even if some outcomes are guessed correctly.  Though not necessarily tied up in a perfect &#34;happy-ending&#34; bow, Moriarty provides a satisfying read that moves along at an appropriate pace.  It was a little difficult to grasp the three parallel story lines in the first three chapters, but make the investment.  They begin to connect quickly, and the effort to build the foundation is worthwhile.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|Love this movie. Saw in theater first and really enjoyed. Clearly definable characters. Fun thrilling exciting from start to finish. Robert Downy Jr at his finest as well as every member of the cast.  Purchased the combo pack so I can stream as well as watch the blue ray and play the DVD portable. Worth every penny.
B001EOOQEM|4.0|I remember when this came out around 1980. I may have been in 10th grade. This was the record. At least my friend played it a lot at his house. I even saw them in concert on their Heaven and Hell tour. The music on here may possibly be better overall, but not to me. Whatever it was Ozzy brought to the band was gone. They are good here on Heaven and Hell, but not great. When you create epic, anything less just isn't good enough. And they couldn't ride on the coat-tails of the greatness they had before, with Ozzy gone. They had to create epic and astounding again, and unfortunately, they came up a bit short.<br /><br />It's interesting that the lyrics Ronnie James Dio wrote to the songs he's played on over the decades have remained somewhat similar. Maybe he really did help write most of the lyrics. Now we know how he got his gigs. And he's a good singer, too. Dio was one of the more respected heavy metal singers. He kept touring even when, as a solo artist, he was performing in small clubs. I suspect he liked his job. If you're a huge fan of Dio, there's a rich body of work to explore and enjoy.<br /><br />This is more music for adult heavy metal or hard rock fans, or for older or mature teenagers. It's not so gimmicky, other than their keeping the same band name. I'm not a post-Ozzy Black Sabbath expert but in retrospect, and it's taken a long time to notice, this may be the best post-Ozzy Black Sabbath album.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Great season so far. Always a surprise can't wait to see what is next. Makes you feel like you should have a plan...just in case.
B004VQFQ2Q|3.0|Vocalist Ian Gillan's shrieks and wails mesh perfectly with Black Sabbath. What a bright combination!<br /><br />This album changes everything. Not one's view of Black Sabbath but one's view of what had come before with Ian Gillan and Deep Purple. Gillian sang the part of Jesus in the musical Jesus Christ Super Star and also sang for the band Deep Purple. After listening to this album one can not listen to the old Deep Purple standards the same way ever again. Deep Purple's 'Machine Head' album in particular was one of the more popular hard rock albums after it's release. It contained radio staples such as 'Trucking', 'Highway Star' and 'Smoke on the Water'. Those songs take on a whole new flavor after listing to Born Again by Black Sabbath. Deep Purple were further out there than we ever knew.<br /><br />Ian Gillan has said that his work with Black Sabbath was one of the most creative periods in his life. Of course, this is the type of thing artists always say (and are required to say?) about their latest album? He's also said he was suffering from a cold when recording this album and wasn't entirely happy with the results. They really go somewhere different on Born Again. A lot of fans and artists list this as their favorite or one of their favorite Black Sabbath albums. Born Again is really more an album for connoisseurs of music or heavy metal. Amazingly, some of the songs here found their way onto rock radio. I give Born Again only 3 stars because, in my opinion, the song writing, overall, isn't that good. Perhaps this is one reason the band tries to sound so different, to cover this up. Never-the-less it is quite different and I think it really works. When it works, it's incredible or nearly so. Again, what a bold combination!<br /><br />I like the album cover (listed as one of the worst album covers of all time) very much, by the way. Is that a Purple album cover?
B006VFLIYK|4.0|The character development in this book is a treat and a must read for his next book The Hit. I look forward to these same characters in subsequent books.
B000002KIK|3.0|Sure, we get to hear Bill Ward sing again. Sure, Ozzy may be improving his vocal style. Sure the songs may be good, and there are genuinely beautiful passages on Never Say Die. Sure, one might even put the music on this album into some kind of music evaluation computer and it wouldn't be shocking if this were judged the best album, but Never Say Die is a snooze fest. Every instrument on here seems to have the same tone. Ozzy's voice blends in well with it, he's pretty bland and unobtrusive on here. Other reviewers have noted this albums similarity to the iconic Blizzard of OZ album calling this something of a preparatory run for Ozzy. Still other's jokingly ask if this is the new Journey or REO Speedwagon album - it's not the hardest rockin album.<br /><br />One could argue that a sort of even tempo approach and even handed delivery is preferable but it's certainly the opposite of what some of Black Sabbath had been about. Never Say Die could be called not just Light Metal but Easy Listening Metal. I like easy listening music. Never Say Die is perhaps more like pop-music from the 70's. That being a time when pop-music was a little softer and safer. I like pop music, then and now, and even Black Sabbath have performed a pop-style song on one or two of their albums before but none of the songs on here are good enough to be a hit. The only excitement on here is when the band incorporate some older style Jazz music into one of the songs. It doesn't work. It doesn't work for me but to tell truth I've never really liked the acoustic style Jazz music I've heard. Not at all. I do like jazz fusion. I believe a New York based Jazz duo, the Brecker Brothers? did an album titled 'Heavy Metal Be-Bop' a few years after Never Say Die came out. It came out a couple of years before 'Never Say Die', actually (Googled it). The tone of the music on that album sounds a bit similar to Never Say Die. Who knows, maybe this Jazz Duo secretly helped make the record. Heavy Metal Be-Bop doesn't sound much like heavy metal, at least not to me, but then again this album doesn't sound like your average heavy metal album either.<br /><br />I give this album a mixed review, and that may be a little unfair of me, because as I mention, there are some beautiful passages here, but there are no songs on here that touch me on any level. I commented on the easy listening aspect of the album but the some of the sound on this album may actually be annoying.<br /><br />I do wonder if the band knew even before they set out to record this, that this would be the last album with Ozzy, and they intended it to be kind of 'weak' and boring and blah, and with no stand out songs. Hey, I'm a conspiracy theorist. I get to say things like that.<br /><br />On second thought, you know who might particularly like this album? Pod-people, like those portrayed in movies like 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers'. Humans who have had their minds taken over by foreign spores and no longer have any feelings or emotions. For some of us, depending on who we are, feelings are considered bad. For some of us, feelings must never surface. They must be punished. Feelings must be prevented. Replicants, and the leftists who spawned them, would prefer this album. Sure they would.much like heavy metal, at least not to me, but then again this album doesn't sound like your average heavy metal album either.

B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is as intense as the first. Can't wait for the movie. Over all great books. Highly reccomend. The story is one you can't put down.
B000002KET|4.0|Is this even a heavy metal album? Remove the fine title track, the slow (almost as if mechanically slowed) and grooving Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, and change the album title and the band name, and this isn't a heavy metal album. Perhaps, perhaps, a metal album, but not heavy metal. This is as heavy as a weighted butterfly. Just noticing. I like this album, and it may be one of their more pleasant listens. . . After I'd completely finished this review, I looked at the Wikipedia entry on the album. Toni Iommi says this album isn't even Rock n Roll. I was thinking about saying something like that, but thought that might be taking it too far (and I love to take things too far) d'oh. It's still a Black Sabbath record, they stay true to whatever mysterious something it is that makes up Black Sabbath but they are stretching out and trying something a little different. This album is cool anyway. Previously, only Pink Floyd could do that. Perhaps the band were doing us listeners a favor with this album.<br /><br />Their last album with Ozzy, Never Say Die, also has a Light Metal feel to it. Generally fans prefer this one. I do too. The lyrics to one of the songs on here lament, \\"you better get yourself another name\\" an ode to the difficulty of going mainstream with the name 'Black Sabbath', apparently. Some of the lyrics can be dark on this one. Ozzy presents himself especially as a tortured artist on this record. The lyrics are lengthy and wordy and they may be more free and introspective on this album, emotive or something, also. One of the songs is about abortion? If you're going to read through to find the song, prepare for a lot of reading. . . The lyrics to the song Sabbath Bloody Sabbath are among the most desperate and depraved Black Sabbath have written. It's as if they are portraying the thoughts of another (likely angry) person. No doubt there are real people like that and if you're a young man you've likely felt that way at some point, desperate and depraved. It's likely such a person would gravitate to this generally dark band. It's a good thing we have Black Sabbath as an outlet?<br /><br />They've done at least 1 anti-drug song, 'Hand of Doom' and at least 2 pro-drug songs, 'Sweet Leaf' and 'Snowblind', here, to borrow someone else's analogy, they decide to split the middle ground and do a pro-drug song while titling it 'Killing Yourself to Live'. At one point Ozzy speaks the words, 'Smoke it. Get high'. Maybe this puts the album over the cool meter. It might have been necessary for him to speak these words 'we are not preaching for you to stay off drugs'. They were. 'Killing Yourself to Live' doesn't ignore the downside of drugs and perhaps, gets to the heart of the real issue. Perhaps the song is more a synthesis of their previous work or a more enlightened look at the subject?<br /><br />'Fluff' and 'Sabbra Cadabbra' are especially light. Sabbra Cadabbra is also happy and upbeat. Perhaps one should say 'very upbeat'. On the album 'Blizzard of Oz' the song 'Steal Away the Night' is also upbeat. Sabbra Cadabbra probably could have been and should have been a hit for the band.<br /><br />I've spent more time listening to the instrumental 'Fluff' than any song on here. One day more recently I was listening to this song and it just was. The magic was gone. If beauty truly is in the eye of the beholder, then 'beautiful' music may also be in the ear of the listener.<br /><br />My ears tell me this is a pleasant listen.ikely such a person would gravitate to this generally dark band.

B00DGGIXS6|5.0|She just loves Cher and it arrived aftera a minor mistake on my part but all is well now and my daughter is in heaven.
B00124HT1G|4.0|In most songs, there's a melody and then a chorus. For some songs there's a melody, a chorus and then a 'bridge', a boring or off key part played 3/4 ths of the way through before the song gets good again and finishes. The band Genesis, who wrote lengthy complex songs early in their career, once said of their new music, 'We make 2 or 3 different songs out of that kind of material now'. On some of the songs on Seventh Star, there's only one part to the song. It's like they just play a chorus or grove over and over, \\"It still haunts me\\". . . \\"I was born, on the Seventh Star\\". . . \\"Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love\\". Some of it also comes across as subdued mood music. I think over all this works very well. It helps that the song writing, or the part they repeat over and over, is very good. Glen Hughes does an excellent, excellent, job singing. I was at least tempted to give this album 5 stars.<br /><br />The album length is only 35 minutes and this came out at a time when albums, for whatever reason, were getting longer and longer. There are at least 2 'filler' songs on here, 'In for the Kill' and perhaps 'Heart Like a Wheel'. The opening track 'In for the Kill' gives new meaning to the term 'filler'. It's like they just started a random thrash riff and sang over it. They must have thought, if we play it faster and louder, and really rock, perhaps people won't know we truly did write this in 5 minutes. It makes the rest of the album sound a lot better.<br /><br />The metal-cry song on here, 'In Memory of' is very good. 'In memory of' reminds me of the Rush song 'After Image'. That song is not as good as 'In Memory of'. It is a bit of a strange song. Musically, it's not very similar to 'In Memory of' but it is very haunting and that's the phrase that is repeated a lot on 'In Memory of', \\"it still haunts me\\".<br /><br />What is going on with these very sad metal-cry songs that seemingly must be included on every major label metal or hard rock album? Are the songs so sad, we carry this around inside of us somewhere and it will come back to haunt us one day? Are they so sad, anything else you experience in life couldn't be worse? Are these songs of such sadness and beauty meant to give humanity to the musical representatives of us fans, fans these same musicians have called, 'the last in line' and citizens 'dehumanized'? 'In Memory of' is really impressive and it stands out on this album with a lot of good songs.is around inside of us somewhere and it will come back to haunt us one day? Are they so sad, anything else you experience in life couldn't be worse?

'In Memory of' is really impressive and it stands out on this album with a lot of good songs.

B00EZN2H68|5.0|I recently reviewed the album Heaven and Hell and called it 'the best post-Ozzy Sabbath album' but after listening to this one, Mob Rules, again, I feel this one may be better. It's as if Black Sabbath built a time machine, traveled forward in time, read my review of 'Heaven and Hell', from a few minutes ago, and decided to write a new album while keeping my criticisms in mind. They try and create different or memorable songs on this one. This one has a few songs that stand out. Voodoo, Mob Rules, Country Girl, Over and Over, and perhaps Sign of the Southern Cross, stand out. Another amazon reviewer rates albums also by their presentation or their packaging. On Mob Rules, the song titles don't stand out. The music is memorable; the song titles, the album name and album cover... they bore? Perhaps this album has slipped a little under the radar because of this? Plus it did follow the well-liked (and memorably named) Heaven and Hell album.<br /><br />Mob Rules is a little too heavy and oppressive? It's not just heavy and oppressive, not at all. Some of the songs on here are very danceable? I like how 'Over and Over' is one of those metal-cry songs (a very good one) yet it's still done with a heavy style. On the song 'Slipping Away', is that a little bit of an Iron Maiden sound in the guitar riff?<br /><br />After listening again, this album is the best Dio-Sabbath album. In fact, this is an awesome album. Let's call it what it is and give credit where it is due.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|There is always room for improvement.  The book was a very good read but there were moments when I became a bit bored because it was lagging in certain places. I would have preferred if the nuns who abused these children were somehow made to pay for what they did, as well as the man who continuously abused the hero of the story.  Aside from my longing for revenge, it was great to see how the author brought 2 children together who had been exiled through no fault of their own.  I would have also loved to know what really happened to the parents and why they abandoned the children in the first place.
B000002KFJ|5.0|Black Sabbath return to a real heavy metal/hard rock sound and they do it even better than they did starting out. Sabotage is a work of art. Sure, there are crunchy, simple riffs (perhaps assaults) in here but they only serve to highlight the beauty of the other songs. This is a change-up. Normally the soft songs and instrumentals included on a Black Sabbath album serve to make the rest of the album sound that much heavier. At this point, I'm just saying stuff, but I like the album. I make that statement flippantly, but I think that really may be what is going on here. Some of the riffs are primitive and almost abrasive, it highlights the beauty in the rest of the song. This is a change or a reversal.<br /><br />There are a variety of song stylings on Sabotage. Even a heavy metal instrumental backed by a symphony orchestra and choir. Black Sabbath was ahead of their time with this song. What was it Cheech and Chong suggested in the 1970's in one of their comedy routines, 'Black Sabbath is just classical music slowed down'?<br /><br />Their previous album, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, included a lot of lyrics suggestive of a tortured artist. On Sabotage they condense that way down into one pop-style song, 'Am I going insane (radio)'. The (radio) probably added in there because it's the single and also their only other hit single 'Paranoid' was also about mental illness. They aren't finished with mental illness, oh no. 'Megalomania' is a 9 minute ode to mental illness. Another reviewer called it a '9 minute orgasm'. If you could only pick one Black Sabbath song, to take to a desert island or something, you couldn't go wrong with this one, it's 9 minutes long (we might want to check your mental condition after a decade or so of listening to nothing but this song). The whole album is 40 minutes long so it only gets better from there. On second thought, if you like 'Megalomania' you probably like this record. If you don't, you probably don't.<br /><br />Was thinking of titling this review '40 minute orgasm' but that's just too gaudy for the title.g this review '40 minute orgasm' but that's just too gaudy for the title.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|Best book ever!!!! I love it and I'll read it over and over! All day everyday. So go out and buy it up.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|So deeply disappointing! I was so excited for this book, but in the end I felt like it was a waste of my time. I loved the other two books which made this book all the more disappointing.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game is a super cool fps it is a mix between cod and bf3<br />I love it its totally with it
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Fun puzzle game.  Just enough of a challenge to not be boring but easy enough to not to be too frustrating.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Daniel Craig is James Bond. He brings the role to life, unlike other actors who merely performed. Moreover, in his Bond movies, gadgets play only minimal roles. As a result, Bond's resourcefulness, his humanity, and his skills are critical to his survival. Judi Dench also performs well as M. Indeed, all the actors performed well, a sign of good direction. The story is exciting and maintained our interest to the end. The locales, as usual, were fun to see, and the entire production was well worth the time we spent viewing it.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I could not put down. So real. I can't wait for the movie. A must read. Beware you will cry.
B0067LY4WG|4.0|Leonard Cohen is at his best in this collection of songs with thought-provoking lyrics. You can't really call what he does &#34;singing&#34; anymore -- it's more speaking in rhythm -- but Cohen's husky voice adds depth that a more perfect instrument would not be able to do. I enjoy this album when I'm in a contemplative mood.
B000NJHX44|4.0|It shipped pretty fast. There was some wear on the sides where the packing wasn't on all the way. But, I'm not complaining as long as it plays. Got it for my husband for Christmas. So I'll find out then I guess.

0307120007|5.0|I probably have read this book a million times. My daughter was in love with it from th first time we read it and it was so much fun to see how she would slowly be able to do each part of it. He favorite has always been touching daddy's scratchy face. By far the best book for babies.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game can be addictive and take control if you allow it.....However, I've gotten to level 31 or 32 and shut it down for awhile.... I took control and shut it down momentarily......I'm going to reach out to family and friends in order to move to the next level....
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|It is sure a great reading. The author is great at describing and giving examples of couples that have encounter problems in their relationship and ways to work on them.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I've becoe a Kate Morgan fan.  Her books weave the past and present together in fascinating stories that capture the imagination and keep you engaged in the story .  She even nailed good endings.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|I had never heard of this movie, but loved the cast.  Jack Black was great.  Subtly funny movie.  Especially if you know any bird watchers.

B005LAJ22Q|1.0|Because it froze up all through the movie, tried it on 2 other peoples dvd players and it did the same thing. Tried to return it but they sent me by email a return label to print off and I don't have a printer to print it off.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|An intriguing game that takes time to complete, but it's design keeps you captivated. The interface is great and works seamlessly. Fun game.
B0049P1VHS|1.0|Same thing as season 2, the movie froze up and we couldn't watch it. I had several people over so we could catch up on the series before the new one started, but that didn't happen since the movie kept stopping
B0085PFG1U|5.0|Great product. It does everything I want it to do. With luck, I will master this app before I die.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I was amazed at the things I didn't know about Nikola. Even more amazed at the things I thought I knew about American history, that I really didn't know. I would recommend this to anyone.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Really enjoyed it. Can't wait to continue with the saga.<br />Thanks Hugh Howey for a great time and a great read.
B00BATG18K|2.0|I loved The Bonesetter's Daughter and The Joy Luck Club. The Valley of Amazement was long and arduous. Half way through the book, I just didn't care what happened to the characters. A disappointment after waiting a very long time for Amy Tan's next masterpiece.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I love this app. I am using Italian and I am speaking with simple words and then are trying to find what I said. I am on my 4th day and I have been introduced to solo many words!
0307743721|3.0|Her writing is intense.  I think I would have to reread several of the stories to understand what is happening.  She jumps around and is not always the easiest writer to read.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This gift was given to my significant other for his birthday from my kids.  It is AWESOME!!!! In fact my teenage son loves it so much he asked for one for Christmas.  We stream nextflix off of our android phones NO PROBLEM!!!<br /><br />I will be buying one for my son soon!  If you were considering buying ~ do it, you won't be disappointed. :)
B00AFROVQC|1.0|There are no redeaming qualities to this piece of junk. And they only get worse as you go. Not to mention the author has chosen to sell the last few as short stories not book leingth.<br /><br />The writing is bad, the grammer is terrible, the editing is non-existant. I am now refusing to read any more of the works by authors who plugged this trash, clearly they didn't read it before spouting out some garbage.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT SINCE MY COUNTRY (GUATEMALA) AT AMAZON.  WHEN I WANTED TO DOWNLOAD THE SOFTWARE TO LINK THIS PRODUCTO WITH THE TV,  I RECIEVED THIS MESSAGE &#34;THE SOFTWARE IS NOT AVAILABLE TO YOUR COUNTRY&#34;.  I WROTE EMAILS TO ASK ABOUT THIS AND I NEVER  RECIEVE ASWERS.  I LOST MY MONEY.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|complex characters and story line, but is in grossing and beautifully written. An absorbing read. Totally believable and a pleasure to read.
B000JMKNJ2|3.0|This is a good first novel, but the magic in the book is entirely unnecessary as it doesn't factor into the plot barely at all.  As such, it's  not really what I would call a fantasy novel.  I won't be reading the next in the series, regardless how many fans the author has accumulated along the way.
B002QNTNL6|4.0|Colin Firth is the reason I gave the movie 4 rather than 3 stars.  There are some unusual plot twists that give the film more style than otherwise.
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|What a film. Certainly not what I was expecting, but having viewed the movie three times it simply grows on you more and more. A very well thought out back-story and superb special effects bring new life to a classic story. I love it!
0545626382|5.0|The packaging was great and there was no damage from shipping. The print was large enough for me. The jacket design was nice and the box sturdy enough to hold all three books. As long as one takes care of the set it should last a long time. I read the books already and have passed it on to my 13-year old who will pass it on to her sister once she is finished with it. I was very happy with the set, the price was right, and I would recommend it as a gift.
B0014QABX0|5.0|Great music, every track is really good.  Black keys have been great for a while and this CD is another example of thier musical talents.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is my favorite Grisham novel, and I've read almost all of them!  There were plenty of surprise twists.  I really liked the ending!
B003AO1SVS|5.0|Great music, every track is really good.  Black keys have been great for a while and this CD is another example of thier musical talents.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|On one hand, I love this game; addictive, mind bending,<br />and a game I spend alot of time playing.<br />On the other hand, the app seems to crash a lot.If it crashes during play, the life is lost. I have purchased helps to get more moves or time, then the app will crash while I'm trying to use it. This causes the purchased help to go away without being used, as well as the life.<br />I am also frustrated that you only get 5 lives, they can be purchased for real money or you get one every 20 min or so.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|Great music, every track is really good.  Stone sour is a true rock & roll band and they bring it in this CD
B00ADQPB50|4.0|Not as good as the first season because it rambles a bit, but was still very very good! AHS is the best show on TV
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It was a riveting novel involving several sets of characters whose story lines come together seamlessly with lots of unexpected twists and turns.
B005SV9X22|5.0|I have watched this over and over and over again. Amazing concert and amazing filming of a concert!  If I wasn't a &#34;Little Monster&#34; already, this made me one forever!  Go Gaga!
B000UJ48WC|4.0|The movie is so much more entertaining after watching Room 237 the documentary about hidden meanings by Stanley Kubrick. Would have loved to met him.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read the heading<br />It is one of my new favorite books, it has a great story and it flows well
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I  have to say I was really disappointed with this finale to a series that I really loved. I felt depressed for a few days after finishing this. But even apart from the dismal ending the rest if the book wasn't nearly as good as the other two. I don't think I slept while I was reading Divergent, it was too amazing to put down. But it took me about three days to read Allegiant, it didn't bother me to put it down and go to bed. Not a good sign for it.<br />It is a huge shame that Veronica Roth chose to complete her amazing series with this extremely average novel.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Although the third book of this trilogy is a good read, I personally enjoyed the first two much more. It will be interesting to see how these play out in film.
B00G722T22|5.0|Another great CD from Avril. This CD has a lot of her styles from previous CD's all rolled into one, and some areas she hasn't touched on yet like Hello Kitty. The first two songs, Rock and Roll and Here's To Never Growing Up kick off the CD in pure Avril party rocking form. Then comes 17 a fun song that like many of her songs tells a nice story. Then my favorite song on the CD, Bitchin Summer, gets you singing along with it's catchy lyrics and music and the &#34;rap&#34; part in the middle is all Avril. I listen to this song over and over, just a great song. Then the beautiful ballad Let Go sung with her husband Chad from Nickel Back really shows her talent and shows off her amazing voice. Next up is Give You What You like, a nice song reminiscent of her earlier cd's, then the rocking song Bad Girl which has a great vibe. Hello Kitty is goofy, but a fun song that can be sung at parties after a drink or two. You Ain't seen nothing yet again has the feel of some earlier stuff, a good song. After that is the fun, get up and dance around the room and sing along song Sippin On Sunshine. It's a great, fun song that just commands you to get up and sing along. The last 3 songs are a bit slower and showcase her lyric writing style and actually shows just how good she is at what she does. 3 beautiful songs to end the CD. Overall just another great CD from Avril that rocks at times, is beautiful at times, and is just a lot of fun that really showcases the talent and many side of Avril Lavigne. If you're a fan, don't hesitate to pick this one up.
B0013FNC38|5.0|Jason Marz is by far one of the best contemporary singer song writers. Poetic lyrics, hilarious metaphors, and exquisite rhythm. My favorite cd by him.
B009QWNS9I|2.0|I just turned off the third episode of season 3, and I won't be watching any more.  I really enjoyed Revenge's last couple seasons, but now I'm just, well, tired of it. It made sense why Emily acted the way she did through the first season especially, but in the last part of the second season, and this season her decisions don't make sense.  It really bothers me how she treats Daniel, who is a good man.  He doesn't deserve to be treated like he is treated. It bothers me that she doesn't care at all that she's ruining his life and breaking his heart over and over, when he treats her with honor and love.  I also really don't like that she was sleeping with Aiden and Daniel at the same time, when Daniel is honorably faithful to Emily even with the french woman incident.  I guess I just really don't like Emily's character anymore.  She's as bad (or worse) than Victoria, and she hurts everyone around her.  I'm also really disappointed the show decided to kill Padma in the second season.  Poor decision on the producers' part. I really liked Nolan and Padma as a couple, and wanted a happy ending for them.  I know that the shows been setting up Jack for Emily from day 1, but I really don't like his character, he acts weak, stupid, and boring.  I'd rather Emily fall for Nolan than Jack.  But really Emily doesn't deserve a good ending anymore after what she has become.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Clever script idea and well executed.  Nice misdirection with a well-written script well acted.  Good job all around and very entertaining.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I really did not care much for the ending.  I think an alternative ending would had been better. I was disappointed.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Jonny Lee Miller is a tremendous talent.  His physical and interior emotional work is fantastic.  Some of the best acting I've ever seen on Television.  Good supporting cast and crisp, interesting dialogue.  Music is nice also
B0000024YL|5.0|If you lived during the 60s, then you must like this album.  It's a classic.  I also saw the movie, The Graduate.  Plus I used to play this at college.  Brings back great memories.
B001NT057K|1.0|READ BEFORE PURCHASING!!<br /><br />This album is NOT the original soundtrack, even though the cover art is the same. The songs are the same but they are not sung by the artists featured in the movie. You won't hear Olivia Newton John, John Travolta, Frank Valli, etc. If you don't care about that go ahead. But I purchased this album to replace my original vinyl and when I went to listen expecting the songs and was extremely disappointed. Again, if you want to buy it make sure you know what you're getting. The actually sound quality is good. I'm giving one start because of the misleading cover art that made me think I was getting something other than what I got.
0156528207|4.0|OK, the truth is, my ex loves this book.  He actually gave me a copy and I lost it.  So I bought another one.  I like the book, but never really understood it and 5 or 6 readings.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|I'm not a comic book geek. However,I did enjoy watching this new Superman reboot. I hope the next movie will exceed this one in storytelling as well as action. I know &#34; Man of Steel &#34; is an origin story of Superman. So, I understood why the writers decided to incorporate flash-backs as a means in telling the Superman story to a new generation. That being said. I hope to see more dialogue/ scenes with Superman and Batman, since the next movie will feature this character. Flash backs were great for telling the  Superman origin story. However, I hope the second  Superman movie will be  completely different storytelling wise.
B00C7607BC|5.0|On time delivery. Digital code was nice to have options to download from Google play or iTunes.  Google play is what I used worked great and is on the cloud for the family to enjoy
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think that this game is awesome and alot of fun. I give it 5 stars it's fun and I like that you can easily get the bananas by jumping over things.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|This is a great movie. I love the whole concept, the only thing i did not care about is the jesus followers, i think that could have been left out and made it an even better movie. I really think they casted this movie perfectly especially Christopher Walken.
006202406X|1.0|Adored the first two books, but completely disappointed with this book overall. Especially the ending, it's too extreme, it could have gone so many different ways and Roth chose the wrong one!
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Saw this at the theather and loved it. The blu ray is good and haven't watched the special features. I am a diehard superman fan so this had to be bought.
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|American Horror Story is one of the best shows on TV.  It's more creepy and disturbing than scary, but that's what makes the show so great. Each season of American a Horror Story is a different theme, and season one is all about hauntings.
B00164GDA0|5.0|Best movie about childhood hands down. Loved watching this with my older brother growing up. LARD A$$ LARD A$$ doesn't get much better than that.
B0013F1D02|5.0|I love this movie! It's a romance that I can watch over and over again! I'm so glad that they finally put it on Prime! I will be watching it multiple times!!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Not your typical YA without grit. Author also assumes the reader has a higher than 6th grade reading level. Love that. Highly entertaining for an afternoon in a hammock!
0679805273|5.0|This is fun and inspirational for all ages.  I should read this more often to uplift my spirits when I am having a rough time; I know a lot of adults that could use it.  I remember the Valedictorian of my graduating high school class read this for his speech and I thought it was perfect.  It gives anybody encouragement no matter where they are in life.  I like how it gives you hope that you can be the best YOU but there will also be ups and downs along the way that can be overcome.  I read it to my kids and they liked different parts of the story.  My young daughter liked the spooky bit, my middle son liked the silly games “there is fun to be done” (which suits his personality), and my oldest son liked the page where everyone was waiting for something (which he understands more at his age).<br /><br />It teaches personal accountability for your choices and living up to your potential.  “You have brains in your head.  You have feet in your shoes.  You can steer yourself any direction you choose.  You’re on your own.  And you know what you know.  And YOU are the guy who’ll decide where to go.”
B000FA5TTW|5.0|Within the pages of this book are bits that are hard to read if you're a person with a heart and find it easy to empathize. But that is what makes this such a fantastic read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Definitely fun and strategic!  I enjoyed tried to figure out the puzzles and then watching my kids trying to do them too!
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Love these things! I wish I would have known about these for my 1st child! I have used these for my youngest since she was born and she loves them. We havn't lost one and she can easily spot them in any room. I have bought them as baby shower gifts and people always ask when I got them.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Very helpful.<br />I find it very quick and easy to clean my kindle fire.  I enjoy the reminders, to help keep it fast.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|even though this is not the same--not even similar, really--to the classic Oregon Trail that i played in elementary school, it is still fun and a terrific way to kill time.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a surprise suggestion from a friend and I read the whole series in 2 days. I'm excited to see what else the author comes out with.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I found myself rushing through the book just to get it over with. I love the first two and loved the story line. Yet, the third book was a little to far fetch for me. It didn't follow the same theme as the first two books. It ended up being a quarantined dome. I would have rather seen it follow up with the original society of fraction that turn into a experiment. Even though they saved the fractions, whats the point if they are just isolated to a gated in society. Who knows maybe a movie will bring more clarity to the whole story.
0316044695|5.0|One of the most amazing stories of survival I have ever read.  The life and trials of Marcus Lattrell were engaging, interesting, and exciting.  I shed a tear or two following along in his footsteps.  This is a must read for all Americans.  We can gain a real appreciation for those engaged in our countrys business.  I have a new appreciation for the efforts of a few in the service of many.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This wonderfully written piece of literature put me through so many intense emotions.  I laughed, cried, and truly stopped to contemplate life and it's meaning. It made  me angry at the cruelty of nature, as would be many while thinking of children suffering from terminal illness.  My heart was warmed with promises of young love and truly crushed with unavoidable tragedy.  This book is a must read for anyone and everyone. For the young and old alike, for anyone who has ever fallen in love, for anyone who has ever suffered and lost, as well as anyone who can appreciate life.  I look forward to reading other books by John Green. Go Read it Now!
B0089LOG02|5.0|Great book! I never knew that there were orphan trains. Left me wanting to learn more. The novel was a fast and fascinating read although it broke my heart when &#34; Dutchy&#34; died. I also thought that the integration of the separate stories was very good. I'll read it again.
B001CDWFPC|2.0|This review is for the Kindle version if the Crossway ESV and is in no way a criticism if the ESV Bible. That being said, I find the Kindle version very difficult to navigate. It is so frustrating at times, that I usually end up pulling out my giant ESV Study Bible or using the free app on my iPhone instead. Save your money and get the app instead.
B0036UMM84|5.0|My favorite all time romantic movie!  My sisters and I used to play this soundtrack over and over again as one of us would sing and the other would put the spot light on whoever was singing…usually Danielle:-)  Love love love everything about it!
B00CHVJ4SO|5.0|If a year ago you had told me that there would be an animated movie about cavemen and that I would enjoy it, I would probably have said you have the wrong movie person. But once again the movies I expect not to like or to completely hate, become the movies that I love to see. Much like Disney's Wreck-It-Ralph( and equally as good if not almost better) The Croods is funny, family-oriented, heartwarming, and interesting. Yes I am a guy, I am an adult, but I did shed some tears during certain parts of the movie. Despicable Me 2 is my favorite animated film of the year thus far, but I can definitely put The Croods as my #2. I hope everybody who has/going to watch The Croods enjoys it as much as I do. Great voice acting, great animation, and a positive message with the adventurous storyline.<br /><br />9/10<br /><br />Starring: Nicholas Cage, Ryan Reynolds, Emma Stone, Catherine Keener

B00B0LPWU6|2.0|Thought there would be some good flying sceenes, but most of the movie is about the pilot dealing with his drinking.  At the end, for some unconvincing reason he admits everything, I think just to have an end to the movie.

B00005JOFQ|4.0|I saw \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" in the theatre, here in the Abitibi (of Qu&eacute;bec) when it first came out. The film repulsed me and I found it very distasteful. Then I read the novella on which it is based and found that much more sympathetic and, actually, quite touching.<br /><br />Comparing notes with a friend, who is also gay, it seems that some of the dialogue that was so cynically misogynistic in French lacks that acerbically anti-women character in the original English dialogue of the film, so a reconsideration is due. Why the French dubbing, at least as heard with the film here in Qu&eacute;bec, added so much gratuitously anti-female bias to the film is hard to comprehend. I am not very sympathetic to feminism, but there are limits to how much a film ought to insult the female of the human species!<br /><br />Although it goes beyond what Annie Proulx' novella and the film recount (but intertwining those two sources), the full-length novel presently available on the WWW (and hopefully to appear in book form), \\"Brokeback Mountain: the Novel, 1943-2006, the Births, Lives, Times, Secrets and Deaths of Ennis del Mar and Jack Twist\\" (by a beefily handsome author who goes by the pseudonym \\"Jet\\") adds some depth to one's appreciation of the characters in the tale. The story is erotised (but not vulgarly so) beyond what there has been already, but in a convincing and vivid way that does not cheapen the tale in any way.<br /><br />The novel opens some episodes or other bits, some of considerable potential interest to many viewers, which were excised during the editing of the film, which may be what most highly interests fans of the motion picture, at least until a truly comprehensive \\"director's cut\\" edition of the film, including these passages, may happen, at last, to appear. Jet's novelisation even fills in Jack and Ennis' childhoods and their parents' stories, a really fine part of what this new novel accomplishes. Jet also carries the story forward into decades after the times of the action recounted in the original novella and in the film. Jet's new novelisation needs to be taken on its own terms, of course, but I recommend it to other readers.<br /><br />There is much in \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" to arouse interest and one's emotions. Whether the original novella or the motion picture, repeated viewings and readings do help for the tale's message to sink into one's conscious memories of it, and Jet's full-length novelisation helps that further. Happy viewing, happy reading!s of the action recounted in the original novella and in the film.

B005C6HGSG|2.0|I have to say I was REALLY disappointed by this. While the writing quality wasn't bad, the tone was extremely inconsistent, and so was the content, which often contradicts the show too. The biggest problem is that this isn't a guidebook, but it's not a novel either... you might get three interesting pages of facts about monsters, and then it dissolves into an unrelated story about one of Bobby's adventures, which is often written so vaguely and quickly it's impossible to care. You'll get pages of lengthy fight scenes but zero real character or plot development on these side stories, which tend to literally read as, &#34;I did this, but it didn't work, so I tried this other thing, which sort of worked, and then we fought&#34; with only a few more details thrown in. It got to the point where I had to force myself to finish it and I was literally skimming by the end. It felt like this book couldn't decide on what it wanted to be, and every element from the plot about Bobby's disappearing memories, to his stories from his hunting days, to the monster-pedia-esque content is severely underdeveloped. None of it works together and it's a bit of a mess. My husband and I were both really looking forward to this, and we're just disappointed now. I got this on sale for 1.99, and I'd recommend waiting for another sale before you pick this one up, and take it with a grain of salt.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Great book, really makes you think about the food we eat and really makes me question the discrepancies of thinking among doctors.  He seems to back his logic with much research and references many studies.  Contrary to Perlmutters research the American Heart Association came out wanting more people to go on statin drugs for controlling cholesterol. This really makes you wonder if the drug companies are lobbying for this or research.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|If I could give this trilogy 10 stars, I would.  I am on my 4th read of these books. It's truly a love story of a modern day prince who finds his princess. And the love they share is beautiful, raw and oh so sexy!  It's not merely about BDSM although that is pretty awesome in itself,  but of two people who fall truly in love when one of them is new to romance and the other finds himself in love for the first time when he never thought, in a million years that this would happen to him. Every time I read it I get something new from it. Enjoy it!
B00CDTSFF8|5.0|An accurate reflection of the material culture of the Vikings.  Also interweaves the Vikings religion and martial beliefs.  The series if full of action and tension between the main characters, often in unexpected ways.
B0000009S3|1.0|Frank Zappa(who discovered the awful truth on Dec 4,1993 the minute after he died) was a God hating man,who spent his entire career mocking and ridiculing Christians,The Bible and The Lord Jesus Christ.His excuse for rejecting God was just that...an excuse.He blamed \\"religious\\" people,when infact he is the one to blame for rejecting God's truth.We all have free will.Zappa's choice of mocking The Lord was of his own.Nobody else's.I just hope and pray that Mr.Zappa asked Jesus' forgiveness and turned to him before his death.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|Wonderful book that touches on a very difficult period in history and yet can still remain uplifting.  The young girl's survival says it all.  She was the symbol of hope for humanity.
B00902AKK4|5.0|Got this as free app of the day. I figured why not if anything my 3 yr old would like and if not we would trash it. Its a little advanced for him but he gets it and minus a little help in some areas he finishes most levels. But I enjoy it alot and it reminds me of qwirk an old puzzle game. Great app lots of fun!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|There could have been better endings to the trilogy.  Great series overall just very disappointed with the end.  Not really looking forward to the movie anymore.  Don't see the point.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Got the game for my 3 yr old and he really likes it. But I have to admit I think i like it just as much. Great graphics, little to no lagging, and good concept makes it a good app. Only draw back is add ons are rediculously expensive and kind of pointless. Since its free you can't beat it almost a five.
B000VI6T6U|5.0|This was Jimi Hendrix's premier performance that made him famous.  Jimi Hendrix fans should see this DVD because after his performance at Monterey, he was a runaway success.  His style has been copied by many guitar players and he remains to be a major influence on musicians today.

B009ZE27US|1.0|This is the most horrible game ever! I hate this game and so do my kids. I would rather eat 60worms than play this game. The person who made this game should be ashamed of themselves. You should be expecting a bad review from me soon and by the way I just got this today and I already deleted it. I feel like I got the stomach flu playing this game! Absurd!
B00DSOG0QS|1.0|Once again I cannot understand how this novel could be classed as a five star read.  I did manage to read through the first 10% but the writing was so immature and the substance matter seemed more relative to YA.  I wouldn't recommend this to mature readers.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I really like it so far hope I don't have to spend  money to keep playing T an enjoyable rate. But nice graphics I'm satisfied for free game

B0095VPBFY|5.0|great apu from AMD not the best in performace as far as gaming goes but it gets the job done AAA games you can play at 720p at about medium settings some games 1080p depending but its a good apu as far as the averge user goes.

B00APKIN1I|5.0|If you liked rock music from the 80s buy this cd.  You will not be disappointed.  Look up the list of musicians who made the cd and you will find the who's who of rock music of the 79's to now. Incredible album
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I don't often comment upon what I'm reading, but I have to in this case.  'The Goldfinch' was absolutely worth waiting for.....I loved 'The Secret History,' but this surpasses it with ease. Very easily the best thing I've read in ten years!

B005544TRQ|5.0|This show quickly captured our interest. A fun blend of interesting drama and exciting twists and turns in the plot. We made it through seasons one and two rather quickly and now can't wait for season 3 to be included in prime. Great show!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just great story telling thru the people above and below in the kitchen. I enjoy the diverse family dynamics thru blood and the families that form below.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I can imagine this book Isn't for everybody, but I loved it. It was an adventure where I didn't know where Gilbert was going go take me.  There is a wonderfully deep message to the story about faith and the origin of life.

1439190976|5.0|After briefly but sufficiently reviewing the historical background to the creation and subsequent development of McKinsey & Company,\\" Duff McDonald correlates this frame-of-reference with the process by which \\"The Firm\\" has had an increasingly greater impact, not only on American business but indeed on almost every part of the world where business is conducted. However, there are several acknowledgments throughout McDonald's narrative that it is difficult (if not impossible) to quantify the nature and extent of that impact, directly through its client relations and indirectly through its former partners who have relocated to corporate C-suites and through books and articles published by partners and former partners.<br /><br />Here in Dallas near the downtown area, there is a Farmer's Market at which some of the merchants offer slices of fresh fruit as samples of their wares. In that spirit, I now provide a few brief excerpts.<br /><br />\\"[Alfred] Sloan and his ilk were perfect customers for McKinsey: Lacking the legitimization of actual ownership, professional managers felt great pressures to show they were using cutting-edge practices. And who better to bring those practices to their attention than consultants who were talking to everyone else?\\" (Pages 19-20)<br /><br />\\"From the very beginning, James McKinsey went to great lengths to distinguish his firm from its less savory predecessors -- he and his partners had multiple university degrees and strong connections to the establishment. And just as McKinsey flipped accounting on its head, he and his contemporaries likewise turned Taylorism on its head. Instead of focusing on line workers at the bottom of the organizational chart, they zeroed in on the growing white-collar bureaucracy and top managers.\\" (27)<br /><br />\\"It's an impossible number to quantify  [the firm's economic impact], given that McKinsey doesn't actually make final decisions for its clients, but it may not be too far off the mark to suggest that McKinsey has been the impetus for more layoffs than any other entity in corporate history.\\" (96)<br /><br />\\"Marvin Bower told his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s that the secret to success was to act successful. He wasn't just talking about McKinsey. He was talking about a specific kind of American confidence that allowed the country to conquer the economic globe to a degree that is only now being called into question, some fifty years later. The country has that confidence -- or it used to -- and McKinsey expressed that as totally and fully as any company the world has ever seen. So it made mistakes. It could fix them. And it did.\\" (191)<br /><br />\\"McKinsey's main asset continues to be the trust its clients have in the firm, an unquantifiable, intangible thing that is constantly being tested. The consultants' secondary assets -- their trust in each other and the internal culture of the place -- have likewise come under stress. The more the organization grows, the harder it is to enforce a coherent set of values.\\" (325)<br /><br />These are among the dozens of business subjects and issues of special interest and value to me, also listed to indicate the scope of McDonald's coverage.<br /><br />o Bastards Require No Diplomacy (Pages 25-38)<br />o Death of a Pioneer: James McKinsey (35-36)<br />o The Repeater: Marvin Bower (41-44)<br />o A Strategy Around Strategy (53-56)<br />o The McKinsey Process (57-59)<br />o Organization Man (64-67)<br />o London Ho! (73-80)<br />o The Emergence of Arrogance (90-95)<br />o Lost Moorings (99-103)<br />o Having Their Lunch Eaten (109-116)<br />o The Last of the Great Generalists (120-125)<br />o Hiring McKinsey Just to Make a Point (187-190)<br />o Enter the Dragon: China (227-230)<br />o Doing a 180 (273-275)<br />o Mercenaries, Not Missionaries (278-282)<br />o Victims of The Own Success (294-297)<br />o The Double-Edge Diaspora (303-307)<br /><br />No single book can do full justice to the scope and complexity of a professional services firm as large and as complex as McKinsey & Company has become since founded by James McKinsey and then led by Marvin Bower during a period of spectacular growth. Nor can a brief commentary such as mine do full justice to the scope and depth of coverage provided. What lies ahead for The Firm?  Here's Duff McDonald's response to that: \\"McKinsey's greatest challenge going forward -- the true test of its genius -- is no longer finding solutions to its clients' problems. The test is managing the complications that have resulted from its own stupendous success. One of the firm's recently stated goals is helping to '[solve] the world's great problems.' But if it wants to achieve this, it's going to have to continue solving its own.\\"<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this boom are urged to check out Marvin Bower's The Will to Lead: Running a Business With a Network of Leaders, Elizabeth Haas Edersheim's McKinsey's Marvin Bower: Vision, Leadership, and the Creation of Management Consulting, and Walter Kiechel's The Lords of Strategy: The Secret Intellectual History of the New Corporate World.arge and as complex as McKinsey & Company has become since founded by James McKinsey and then led by Marvin Bower during a period of spectacular growth.

B003O86FMW|5.0|The book was great as expected ,but I thought there would be a happy ending ,or somewhat of a happy ending.
B00CHVJODE|4.0|A Stone Age family of six, The Croods live in a world where life is a nonstop struggle for survival and where anything new is to be feared and avoided at all cost. Or at least that's what young Eep (Emma Stone) has been taught to believe by her well-meaning but over-protective dad, Grug (Nicholas Cage). But Eep is a naturally bright and curious sort, and when she meets a cute boy, Guy, (Ryan Reynolds) living out on his own who's discovered this new-fangled thing called &#34;fire,&#34; she makes it her life's mission to start venturing out a bit more on her own. Guy also offers her a more optimistic view of life and the future than she gets from her scaredy-cat dad who prefers to huddle with his family in a tiny cave safe from the threats outside. But when an earthquake destroys the family's cave, they are all forced to hazard out into the big bad scary world of threats by nature and hungry prehistoric predators.<br /><br />Written and directed by Chris Sanders and Kirk DeMicco, &#34;The Croods&#34; is lively and fun and built upon the theme of learning to face one's fears and of finding the courage to move on to bigger and better things in spite of the potential dangers lurking along one's path..<br /><br />In addition to the amusing, nicely differentiated family members, there's the customary bevy of cute and cuddly prehistoric creatures (even the threatening ones are kind of cuddly) to make this a fine, non-threatening look at life in prehistoric times, fit even for the more impressionable kiddies.<br /><br />The computer-generated animation is clean, if not exactly envelope-pushing or spectacular, and it makes up in speed what it lacks in sophistication.
B000XUBFE2|2.0|very morose.  It was hard to follow the author's point of view, however his characters were developed quite well except Death.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|Based on the book by Max Brooks, “World War Z” is a gripping, adrenaline-pumping thriller about a worldwide zombie apocalypse (a phrase that is fast becoming one of the most overused in modern pop culture).<br /><br />Brad Pitt plays a retired UN employee, now stay-at-home dad, who barely makes it out of Philadelphia alive with his wife (“The Killing’s Mireille Enos in a largely insignificant role) and two little daughters as the zombie attacks spring up seemingly out of nowhere.  Because of his previous experience maneuvering through arduous situations, he is sent out into the world to find answers as to how the plague may have started and to discover what possible remedies there might be to keep the human race from literally devouring itself into nonexistence.<br /><br />These are not the shambling, foot-dragging zombies of the Romero films or TV’s “The Walking Dead.” They’re not only fleet of foot but are able to scale seemingly impenetrable walls by piling one on top of the other like a cheerleader pyramid on steroids (in their speed, they actually have more in common with the creatures in the “24 Days Later” series). This may make them a lot harder to outrun, but it robs them of some of the creepiness we normally associate with the zombie figure.<br /><br />Because the movie is done on a global rather than intimate scale, it lacks the haunting, soul-searing dread and emotional desolation of a work like “The Walking Dead.” In contrast, “Z” feels more like a grand action movie but, even as such, it hits all the right notes. Thanks to Brooks’ beat-the-clock scenario (adapted herein by Matthew Michael Carnahan, Drew Goddard and Damon Lindelof) and Marc Foster’s full-throttle direction, the audience rarely gets the chance to relax the muscles, as we hurtle right along with Pitt from one close-call encounter with a baffling, seemingly intractable enemy to the next.<br /><br />Not all that memorable really, but entertaining while it’s going on.going on.
B00EPFEY44|1.0|The delivery was fine but I was very disappointed at how much had been edited out of the original that was screened in cinemas throughout the country.

I've lent out copies to many of my friends and family-members, encouraging to read it for their personal benefit.

B008IJT0CE|5.0|I need this app in order to guarantee sleeping well. It is priceless to me, although I don't suppose I would pay $500 for it. It has a plethora of soothing sounds and upon extremely limited experimentation I have found a combination of sounds that ensure my sleep will not be disrupted. I sleep through dogs barking within a 30 foot radius of my open bedroom windows and am only bothered by nightmares when I sleep now. Please support the people that made this by spending a mere $3 for what for me has improved my quality of life.

Now a month later, the watch doesn't work and according to the return policy, we can't return it because the time has expired. We have sold items on Amazon ourselves and we are shocked at this POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. We are DONE shopping on amazon!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Light reading, decent plot with a couple of unexpected twists woven in.  Enough to keep you reading!  Enjoyable if you like a light mystery.  Kind of &#34;girly&#34;.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|I have to laugh when I read the reviews that call Bram stoker's Dracula &#34;boring&#34; and &#34;unimaginative.&#34; Without Stoker's world-famous classic tale, none of the vampire movies and books we know today would exist. Of course the narrative has flaws -- what narrative doesn't? But boring and unimaginative, it ain't. Stoker was the original author who popularized the legend of the vampire and set it down in a form that would entertain and captivate readers -- you can see the success of his novel in every vampire novel and big-screen production today. Mission accomplished!
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Leonardo Dicaprio was fantastic!  But this is the type of movie that lends itself to being on the big screen.  It didn't translate all that well to t.v.  I had not read the book, so I didn't know what to expect.  But being a Baz Luhrman film, I should have realized it would be all about the cinematography and very stylized.  It did flow nicely.  I guess you just have to like this type of movie.  It was very pretty.
B005K17RU0|5.0|the app is great! it shows temperatures in the future and present. the only problem is it take about 15 seconds to open the app. all I wish is that it was a little faster. otherwise this is an excellent product! :-)

Whatever is was, he must have done something great to have been chosen.  I feel love and kindness is in us all, animals bring it out.  Good luck James, a piece of chicken from me for Bob<br />R

B009SJ3GUK|4.0|The acting is great, there is a definite plausibility to it, which in my mind will make or break something in the horror genre, and there is a very powerful spiritual dimension as well, of people struggling with their dark energies and finding the courage to overcome them, without the sugar-coated &#34;Touched By An Angel&#34; crap. Jessica Lange is amazing.
B00ANYUIYG|4.0|This book was assigned to me for a university course on terrorism. This was a great book for understanding the mindset not only of terrorists and other groups with \\"extreme\\" views, such as religious cults, but also understanding group psychology in general. This book was a wonderful look at the political and psychological factors of radicalization - not only how they affect foreign entities such as al Qaeda, but the insidious ways in which radicalization can penetrate (and often has penetrated) our very own society at the personal and governmental levels. Highly recommended even as a casual read. Always remember, terrorism, as a product of radicalization, does not come from some essentialized \\"evil\\" or \\"crazy\\" mindset, nor is it psychologically foreign - radicalization is something that any group or individual can experience.

0316055433|4.0|While less intense than Tartt's phenomenal debut novel, The Secret History, The Goldfinch is nevertheless a highly engaging read. This book follows young Theo Decker's journey from the survivor of a mysterious explosion to the aftermath in adulthood. Throughout the book, as Theo moves between different guardians (some more benign than others) he is accompanied throughout his ordeals by the titular stolen painting, which is a source of both guilt and comfort. The characters, while lacking the mystique of the clique of students in Tartt's Secret History, are quite memorable. Images of the Mafia gangster Bobo Silver, as well as Theo's drunken, gambling-addicted father, sickly, reclusive Andy, and Theo's delinquent, self-destructive best friend Boris are all likely to haunt the audience long after the book has finished. With its sprawling plot and exploration of the main character's movement between various social classes and sometimes abusive guardians, comparison to Dickens is certainly not unwarranted. Indeed, The Goldfinch is a triumphant return to some of the themes that define Tartt's work: class and culture in American society, the nature of guilt, and the untrustworthy nature of love and friendship.

B00BD99JMW|4.0|This is the final book in the Divergent Series which I have loved and this book was really good too.<br /><br />What is outside of the fence? How will their worlds change when they find out the answer? In Allegiant we finally find out the answers to these questions and find out things were definitely not as they thought.<br /><br />The twists and turns are outstanding but also believable and work well into the rest of the series.<br /><br />I really am unsure what else to say as I don't want to giveaway anything. I guess all I can say if you have liked the series up to this point you will absolutely love or you will hate this book. Some of the twists and turns left me so angry but yet also seemed so right and so believable; so in the end it felt like the right ending.<br /><br />The end and some big aspects of the story seemed wrapped up too quickly, or just ignored all together; but I did like the overall message of the story.<br /><br />This book does switch back and forth between Tobias and Tris, by chapter, at times their voices were quite similar and it was hard to remember who's chapter it was.<br /><br />Overall though I loved the series; though the truth about what is outside the fence definitely changes everything.<br /><br />Veronica did a great job wrapping up this series.

I was totally in love with both the main characters.  From two very different backgrounds, both culturally and class-wise.  But who would every know, watching the chemistry between them and their mutual respect and friendship.  I loved this movie so much that I just ordered it from Amazon.com, even though I have seen it 3 times!!!

B00E0H8KAQ|5.0|Decca continues the recent trend that redefines the box set as a cube filled with around 50 CDs in simple card sleeves plus a thick booklet with the necessary data.  It's both a big-ticket item at the asking price while still a low-budget bargain on a dollar-to-disc ratio.  As a novice listener of classical music, I've found this sort of set to be invaluable at quickly building my library.  More experienced collectors may prefer to take a census of their own catalogs first to see if this box has too many redundancies to make it worth purchasing.  It's notable that the price for this set is a bit higher than previous such sets from Decca and other labels.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is not one of those helpful reviews that details all fifty discs.  Mr. Birman's review above includes a list of all the recordings organized by composer.  The item page for this release on Amazon UK includes all the basic listings by disc in the product description, and reviewer Ultrarunner there offers further details for each one.  Additionally, I don't have the ears, equipment, or expertise to comment well on specific technical aspects of the sound, either of the original recordings or how well they've been mastered for this release.  Rather, I hope I can convey a general sense of this set's appeal to the casual listener with limited experience with classical music.<br /><br />To that end, I hope I can offer some helpful points about the contents even without having heard all 50 discs.  First of all, as \\"The Analogue Years\\" makes clear, this set is exclusively from the stereo recording period 1954-1980, while the first Decca Sound box was split evenly between analog and digital recordings.  This provides a focus not only on the results of the now long-gone recording and mastering techniques used to produce these albums, but on the musicians and conductors of that time period.  At a glance, this set offers much more of Mehta, Solti, Dorati, and Maazel, among others, than seen on other sets that cover wider ranges of time.<br /><br />As the analog recording era coincides more or less with the LP era, the running times of the original albums were usually 40-45 minutes with an absolute maximum of an hour.  Thus nearly all these discs with their original album covers have been extended with \\"generous fillers\\" (as the package copy cheesily describes) that mostly sit comfortably as bonus recordings alongside the original offerings.  Generally these extras culled from other Decca releases are either more compositions by the same composer but perhaps different musicians, or more performances by the same ensembles or conductor but recorded a year or two apart.  Two odd cases pop up, though.  CD 9 features Kyung Wha Chung and Radu Lupu performing violin/piano sonatas by Franck and Debussy in 1977, followed by chamber pieces by Ravel and Debussy recorded by the Melos Ensemble in 1961!  CD 47 couples Tchaikovsky's medium-length showpieces (1812, Cappricio Italien, Marche Slave) with Rachmaninov's 2nd piano concerto, but besides the Russian composers the only common element is the London Symphony Orchestra of Spring 1958, with Alwyn conducting the former pieces and Solti the latter.  I don't think either of these are problematic couplings, but they are interesting juxtapositions with which a purist might quibble.<br /><br />Overall, though, the bonuses provide the appropriate bang-to-buck ratio.  Thirty of the fifty discs exceed 70 minutes, with about a third of those breaking the 80-minute barrier.  All but one of the remaining 20 are at least an hour long, the sole exception being CD 20 featuring Chung's versions of violin concertos by Walton and Stravinsky at just 52 minutes.  I guess they couldn't find a Mozart clarinet concerto by someone else to fill the gap.<br /><br />One down side of the bonus-filler strategy is that it's difficult to tell how other original Decca albums have been split up over these discs, and thus what pieces are left out and ignored in this re-release/sampler box approach.  The booklet includes catalog numbers for the original releases of each recording so some research could reveal this information but it doesn't solve the problem of re-releasing those recordings or tracking them down on other releases already available, should one be interested in that.<br /><br />Speaking of the booklet's information, the opening pages are especially and unusually helpful, presenting an index of composers and compositions in the box, followed by performer/ensemble/conductor and disc number.  This allows one to find a desired disc quickly, or to realize that it must be in a different box (and that perhaps one has accumulated too many of these boxes).  Otherwise the booklet contains the standard expanded track listings for each disc, session details such as date, location, and production personnel, and photos from the sessions.  Two extensive articles at the end report the history of the Decca Sound in this period, one focused on the technicians and equipment, the other on the recording halls, conductors, orchestras, and repertoire involved in making these recordings.  It makes clear that this box represents just a drop in the bucket of the label's classical music releases.  There have been whole conductor's/ensemble's cycles of the symphonies and chamber pieces of single composers recorded for the label over the years that are merely glanced at by the works re-released here.  Are the rest of those cycles currently available on CD or out of print?  Given that these are pre-digital recordings that have probably been supplanted in modern decades, my guess is probably not.<br /><br />Where sets like this fall short is in providing greater analysis of the performances.  This is limited to complimentary review blurbs on the back of each sleeve.  As a somewhat inexperienced listener with a basic music appreciation background I would like to know a bit more about the musicians and their approach to playing thesepieces, what difference the conductor makes, or what subtleties are revealed by the recording technique that I should be trying to hear.  But this is a low-budget item.  The booklet would need to be twice as thick just to present this information in English, much less in the French and German translations included.  I suppose the trick is to listen and discover on one's own what makes these pieces in these versions special.  In any event, Wikipedia is always there to provide some of this missing information, at least about the compositions themselves.  So keep your phone handy as you listen.<br /><br />I also find it unfortunate that there seems to be no information readily available about the musicians in the various orchestras whose talent and skill are displayed but who are kept anonymous primarily because they didn't belong to a small ensemble.  Their contributions are certainly important.  When a conductor is praised on a back cover blurb for the sound he draws from the strings or woodwinds, it's a shame that the players cannot likewise be credited.<br /><br />There are no redundant inclusions of recordings already found on the first Decca Sounds box.  There are a few pieces that overlap with that set, such as the Rite of Spring, Ravel's Boléro, and Shostakovich's 1st symphony, but these are minimal and they are by completely different performers.  In fact I appreciate that this set does not come loaded with pieces that are amply represented in other such boxes from other labels.  There are a few--Rite of Spring and Boléro in particular seem to be ubiquitous (perhaps mandatory), and you also get Beethoven's 9th, Schubert's 8th and 9th, Brahms's 1st piano concerto and Rachmaninov's 2nd,--but by and large, the repertoire here represents a broad selection of works that, while by no means obscure, seem to me to be not that redundant to the casual listener who has gathered more than a few of these massive best-of boxes.  Such less common items in this set includeChopin's études, Britten's symphony for cello & orchestra, Gounod's ballet music for Faust, string quartets by Shostakovich, and a large selection of works by lesser-played composers such as Balakirev, Berwald, Bloch, Hindemith, Honegger, Martin, Surinach, and Weber, among others.<br /><br />All that said, Grieg's Piano Concerto in A minor is included twice in this set, once in a featured 1973 recording by Lupu with Previn conducting the London Symphony Orchestra, and again as a bonus coupled with Grieg's music for Peer Gynt and performed by Clifford Curzon with an earlier (1959) LSO conducted by Fjeldstad.  Not to say that this is a problem, but I'm glad it isn't repeated with more works.<br /><br />The packaging keeps with the size and appearance of previous such collections from Decca and other labels.  I like the magnet in the lid that nicely snaps it shut, and this box seems a little more durable than ones I've received for other sets.  I like the ghostly images of the classic LP labels around the sides of the box.  The card sleeves themselves purportedly present the original sleeve artwork and many of these covers are striking.  I have no idea how well these stood out in the record shop in the olden days but the art is attractive and must have made a strong impression in its original 12\\" form.  The digital era has made many wonderful advances possible in terms of sound reproduction and listening convenience (not to mention the portability of this little box rather than the 50+ heavy albums they reproduce) but one regression is the loss of size that results in reducing later CD covers to portraits of the artists.  No doubt the modern all-digital era will take that even further as the need for sleeves disappears entirely and at best all you get to look at is a large postage stamp on your smartphone's screen.  As with most of these sets, the back sides of the sleeves provide a simplified list of the works performed, their durations, and the musicians involved.CD 1 turned out to have an error on the sleeve, listing the pieces in the wrong order, but the booklet has the correct track listing.  I don't know if any other such errors are on these sleeves, but that's a very minor detail.<br /><br />The value of this set for me is that it expands my library of classical music without contracting my bank account excessively.  This is no small blessing.  When I reached a point in my life where I wanted to start hearing something other than the pop music that fills my collection, the vast history of classical music overwhelmed me and stalled my entry into it.  Box sets like this allow for a comparatively small investment relative to the payoff of dozens of hours of music that enlivens and uplifts.  Not all of it will receive repeat play in my house--try as I might, I really have a tough time appreciating most vocal classical music whether chorale, opera, or lieder.  But at just a few dollars per disc, it's a small loss compared to the plentiful dividends provided by the rest.  What's more, my children are hearing this music and visibly enjoying it, an unexpected reward.

B00GOQ9M4O|5.0|This was honestly my favorite episode of this whole season. I love the fact that the villain from last season is revealed to be just as much of a hero as Rick. The whole point is, neither one of them is bad or good, they're both human, capable of both being good and evil. I'm sorry that so many simple minded fans are having a hard time grasping this concept, but I think whoever wrote and directed this episode should win a freaking award, because this was the best one I've seen in ages.

B00EW9GQR6|3.0|I love Lady GaGa and I still do! I respect when an artist experiments and takes chances, but this album just doesn't do it for me that much! The album is very sexually charged which I don't mind, but I don't think that she did it any justice! The only tracks I really enjoyed were \\"Manicure\\" (strangely), \\"Do What U Want Featuring R.Kelly\\", \\"Gypsy\\", and \\"Applause\\"! I bought the album to support her, but if she were a new artist, I wouldn't have bothered! I recommend a track by track purchase unless somebody thinks otherwise!

B00G32OER4|3.0|It was interesting, but I thought I was going to see more death or madness that was my disappointment. Overall, it was a good movie to watch. If you are sensitive to scary movies you'll love it but if you a hardcore scary movie fan then you'll think of it a good movie (potential) but it could've been better.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|This is one of the more interesting Scarpetta Novels. There is a clear-cut mystery that has to be pulled together. A lot of possibilities ruled out. Even the emotions of our heroine do not overwhelm the story of a serial killer. Scarpetta's insecurities about Benton, Marino's insecurities, have not twisted a good thriller into an emotional mishmash. Scarpetta remains the brilliant forensic investigator that she is, the pets are happy, Lucy is happy, Benton is nearby, and Marino, well he's off on another tangent, and who knows what trouble that will cause in the future? Stay tuned!

B00992CF6W|3.0|For the first few weeks I was obsessed with it but pretty soon it got boring.

If you like building this app is good but I wish it would allow you to connect with more people and stuff. I give it a three because I have better apps that are free.

B0074QGGK6|5.0|I loved this book. It is short and sweet and inspirational to me (a wannabe artist/writer, just starting out).<br /><br />It's a fun book. It's easy to digest. It's inspirational.<br /><br />For me, the book is not a license to steal, but permission to write.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Denzel Washington is, in my opinion, at his prime right now. and has been for the past few years. ALL of his movies are fun filled, and interesting. Here's another added to the list!
0786958731|5.0|Great for getting people who are not so great at role playing into D&D. Me and my friends are just those people; we like D&D but have all found it hard to get into games because we're weak at role playing. It's especially nice not to need a GM since none of us are very qualified story tellers.<br /><br />Just like the other two D&D board games (Castle Ravenloft and Wrath of Ashardalon) the rules and over all game play are simple enough to just jump in and play, but it still has enough to it that it retains much of the feel of a pen and paper D&D game. There's still a lot of table talk, teamwork, and player interaction. And for those who are good at role playing, there's still room for it.<br /><br />So far I like the character selection, but if you really want a mage/wizard character, you wont find one in this game. All the player characters are physical fighters (Barbarian, Rogue, Archer, Fighter, etc.), so no magic.<br /><br />Otherwise, I like the setting, monster types, and villains. It's not all that different from Castle Ravenloft, which I've also played, though.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Good, well written story. Grisham has done it again. I need eleven more words to post this so it's done.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Easy to learn and  Easy to aim and shoot. I would recommend this to all my friends to try out
1401938906|5.0|Excellent book.  Explains the Law of Attraction uniquely, logically.  I've been reading it slowing and how not finished it yet, but so far I would highly recommend it!
B00B5HQL50|5.0|I have followed James Bond movies for the 50 year history.  There is lots of action in the movie.  As always, the music introduction is appealing.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|A perfect way to explore the reasons for people to be duped into doing something that common sense tells them to avoid!
1608872750|5.0|I admit it. I had no clue what this book was going to be. I ordered it because I've loved the \\"Art of\\" books from Marvel and thought this would at least be fun. I wasn't wrong.  So what is it? Something of an art book crossed with a technical manual with a dash of scrapbook thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />The book is split into seven sections: 1) Understanding Tony Stark, 2) Stark Industries: A History of Innovation, 3) The Forging of Iron Man, 4) The Mansion and the Workshop, 5) Weaponization: the Iron Man Armors, 6) Global Threats and 7) Mr. Stark's Allies.  Like the \\"Art of\\" books, this manual has a lot of color photographs of locations, people and the armor.  Where this book differs is that it's all presented as real. The photos are of Tony Stark, his home and workshop, etc.  The book reads like a corporate dossier, as prepared by JARVIS. \\"Stark Industries\\" is printed on the cover (not Marvel!).<br /><br />Like a technical manual, there is a lot of detail on the armors - ALL OF THEM. There is at least a small pic and a blurb for each of the Iron Legion and larger exposes of Tony's main armors. It even goes into details regarding weaponization, gauntlet design, inside the helmet, etc. All referenced as real artifacts - not as concept for a film.  There are fold-out pages, schematics, etc. But what really makes this book special is the scrapbook aspect.  There are Post-It notes, memos, pamphlets, etc. \\"glued\\" in throughout the book. There is even a blue folder inserted (it is bound in) at the beginning which includes Christine Everhart's article on Tony, his notecards from the press conference, his business card, and pics!  One Post-It is a reminder that he needs to come up with a \\"real name\\" for the element he discovered for the Nobel Committee to use.  There are memos from SHIELD, including Black Widow's assessment, as well as a visitor badge to Stark Industries, and so much more. These are like little Easter eggs scattered throughout that make the book a lot of fun to go through.  As a Loki fan, I was delighted to find the God of Mischief has a couple of pages under \\"Global Threats,\\" right alongside Whiplash and Mandarin.<br /><br />The production values are excellent. Not only does the book have a red leather cover, with cloth spine, but it is smyth-sewn (not glued). This means the book lies open flat without damaging the spine. Very helpful for a \\"manual\\".  There's no dust jacket, as befitting a technical manual, and the paper is thick and high quality.  Full color glossy pages throughout - a truly beautiful book.<br /><br />Overall, I cannot recommend this enough to Marvel fans in general, but especially to fans of Iron Man. A truly unique book that is actually worth the retail price. Highly recommended!lot of fun to go through.

B0094BB4TW|4.0|We all have that love hate relationship with facebook. Always easier than the website. The trick is to stay off of it and get work done.
0312370830|3.0|I did not like the story.  It was great about Austrailia.  The kidnapping plot offended me.  Strange plot.  Great love
B00A8ECU24|2.0|Got this for my daughter because she's WAY into Ponies right now. She couldn't get it and I found it pretty hard to understand. Disappointed that we had to uninstall it.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I was a big fan of 24 and someone recommended Homeland to me - I am hooked! Great acting and the storyline is compelling and relevant - a great mix of real life politics, international concerns and personal relationships.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|Got this thinking I would use it all the time but I found myself using my phone like I always have. Its a good app I just had a hard time transitioning from my phone to tablet.
B00006674X|5.0|Its Elvis...............my wife insisted I get this movie, and she loved it.  If your an Elvis fan, it will be right up your alley.......
B006PAV1XO|5.0|AL was a smart, geeky, funny movie. I didn't think I would like it as much as I did but I watched it twice now.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Got this book because I heard so many good reviews of it.  It was a good read and now I am anxious to see how they did with the movie.
B00FVAEKJ6|5.0|The FlipPix games are very addictive, but in a good way.  I love these things! You can do these puzzles over and over if you want.  Great game!
B00F9040HU|4.0|Lots of fun. Interesting game. I find it fascinating as I journey from region to region.<br />Looking forward to trying new games. Just need to correct the word &quot;inscribed&quot; before you enter the next region.
B000NQRE1E|1.0|At what point does telling a fictional love story wrapped in the middle of an actual tragedy cross the line? The answer is of course, James Cameron's Titanic. Finding true love and one's personal inner fire is both personal and intriguing. There are many of us trying to find that every day of our lives, but to use the backdrop of one of history’s worst maritime disasters to tell that story is callous, very callous. Cameron won the accolades of his Hollywood peers and a very big paycheck. Yet, the story, the real story of the loss and pain of the Titanic still eludes us and perhaps always will. So many different accounts of the few whom survived and the lack of technical recording equipment will leave this disaster's true horrors locked within history. No fanciful love story can or will give a respectful tribute to those who died that night. Fans of this film will claim it's only a movie - NO it's not just a movie according to James Cameron; he actually believes this film is a true telling of what happened and envelopes the confusion and pain that must have permeated the Titanic’s Crew and Passengers that night. I have a hard time believing Cameron's assertion. It's nothing more than a fanciful love story wrapped in the center of a maritime disaster that took the lives of 1,514 people. If that is what it takes to sell a movie ticket and make a name for yourself in Hollywood - then perhaps the industry as a whole is ripe for downfall.  What’s next a love story amidst the holocaust in Auschwitz?<br /><br />As Cameron accepted his Academy Awards for this film he gave a very middle finger vindictive, &#34;I'm King of the World&#34; declaration to many who were in the audience that night whom had openly doubted and derided him about the film. And I do wonder, would he say the same, if in the midst of that audience there sat the 1,514 people who died that night?
1476727651|3.0|I am a total and forever fan of Stephen king. This one is just.....o.k. It could have been a lot better in my mind, The potential for a fabulous book was there. Just like the follow up to The Talisman. The Black House. it was a disappointment. maybe all attempts at follow ups are a let down. But the &#34;creatures&#34; in this one just sort of seemed like a cop-out.  It should have been a whole lot better. If you compare it to it's pre-quill- &#34;The Shining&#34; - it's not even close. But seeing as I keep having faith in Stephen- I will continue to buy his books.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Great pop record. The packaging is nice and the seeds that came along with the pre-order were cool as well. I know I'll be listening and re-using this album for years to come.
B00D8CSVLW|3.0|while it was great to return to the scene and characters of the older famous case, I found this story a bit slow, too many characters, the plot was interesting but to be honest I just wanted to finish it so I could start a new book.
B006FPFTMS|4.0|Through some technological malfunction I lost use of all my apps on Kindle fire. I was able to restore all except my EZPDF reader.In search for a new pdf reader app I first tried Adobe. Horrible, cumbersome app, lacked even a bookmark feature. (Would not allow me to create my own bookmarks or if it did I could never figure it out} Then saw the Foxit app. I use Foxit on my laptop and love it. Relatively easy to use. Allows me to highlight, annotate and bookmark. I do wish it had a text box feature (which it may but I just haven&#34;t figured it out). Highly recommend it!

B0063IH60K|5.0|Keeps improving.
1402713185|5.0|My daughter loved this book. I like this particular series as they are hard backed, sturdy books, with nice art on the cover. They are perfect for a young reader (lower elementary).
B000HL2J0G|5.0|If I could give MacGyver more than 5 stars, I would.  I've learned what to do in so many unexpected situations from watching this show.  I go through life more confident than ever now, knowing I am prepared for being lost in a South American jungle or aboard a hijacked train in eastern Europe.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I never read \\"crime\\"  novels but once started could not put down this trilogy. Stieg Larsson writes so very well he kept me riveted and I am so very sorry that there will be no more from him. This was a fully developed story and cast with a satisfying and appropriate ending.
B009AMANBA|5.0|In the age of film and television there have been many movies and miniseries about the Civil War period.  One of the best appeared in 2012, when &#34;Lincoln&#34; garnered wide acclaim--it recalled the sixteenth president's successful effort to get the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution successfully through the House of Representatives.<br /><br />While the film portrays the fight to pass the most important bill to move through Congress in American history, those who follow politics closely will recognize issues raised by the film that are common to politics in all ages on all types of issues:  friction between the president and Congress, debate in the White House over when the most propitious time to send legislation to the floor would be, soul-searching that legislators must do on when to stand firmly on principle and when (and to what degree) to trim their sails to forward their ideals to (hopefully) the greatest degree.  &#34;Lincoln&#34; also portrays the pressures from all different directions, including family members, with which a president must deal.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis took home the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance (the film was nominated for a dozen Oscars), and the cast included other big names such as Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones.  The cinematography is a credible re-creation of mid-nineteenth century Washington.  There are a couple of harrowing scenes that would not be appropriate for younger children, but &#34;Lincoln&#34; is a must-view for all history geeks from high-school age onward.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I love any thing written by John Grisham.  His knowlege of the legal system and alchoholism never ceases to amaze me.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I enjoy a good read, and this certainly is one. I love how this author untangles the knots in his characters lives. One of those books I look forward to curling up with having a cup of something warm or glass of something cold in the afternoon or evening.
014241722X|5.0|Great reading, looks to be developing basis of a series. Great story line built around young central character. Recommend highly
B00FCR3JQS|4.0|If you enjoy HONY, you will enjoy this book.  The same wit and beautiful photographs that are on the website are in the book.  However, I bought the Kindle version to read on my Fire.  The book is not formatted well for this device.  If you are really interested in seeing the pictures and reading the captions, buy the book.  You cannot &#34;zoom&#34; in on the Fire.  I suppose I could have looked at it on my computer and the screen would have been larger but I didn't.  I wish I had purchased the hard copy.
B00004Z459|1.0|Disc was unreadable, scratches throughout. It was a complete ripoff. To top it off, the packing slip was not enclosed and I didn't write down the vender who sold it. Way to go...
B008LXZFH6|1.0|This is the absolute worst movie EVER!! I was told by my girlfriend to watch it before we went to Anchorman 2
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Great book.  When I finished book one, of course, I had to continue the series.  I am still reading it.  Hope to finish soon so that I can get book 3.
B0094MFITS|4.0|Very enjoyable movie, Tom Selleck did a great job of keeping us on the edge of our seats. go watch it now!
B004HW7JI8|5.0|This set of dvd's were new and arrived as expected. Love the show and love watching the dvd's while waiting for new season to start.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best series I have ever seen.  The drama of this series is unlike any other show I've encountered.  Great story line and suspense.
B00EL90O20|5.0|I got the Blu-Ray/CD steelbook edition from an ebay seller in England, only took a couple of weeks to show up in my possession. I had reservations about the steelbook because I had heard horror stories with a lot of discs getting scratched in steelbooks especially one of the Halo videogames when it first came out. When I checked it out, everything was perfect, and what a beautiful case it is. The CD's sound excellent, though the Blu-Ray is what I really paid for. Sound and picture quality are top-notch. 1080p, stereo sound only. No DTS, but I never found it to my liking anyway with concerts. Juan Urteaga (Machine Head, Cattle Decapitation, Exodus) did an awesome job with the live audio mix, even better than Machine Head's latest live album that he also mixed. If you own Blu-Ray and you're a fan of Testament or metal in general, get this. It's region 0, you should have no difficulty watching it. It's worth it.
B0045HCJT4|4.0|Arrived on time and in good shape.  A great Kurt Russell sci-fi movie.  Just when you thought you had job security, they get rid of you.
B00EGMHKBA|5.0|Could not put this down!! Started reading and got totally drawn in to the story of the Circle. Is this what we will have in the future?
B009JZSC9S|5.0|This season was seriously addictive! I don't know how the writers do it, but each episode seems to get better and better!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I got the free version first but after I finished the first three levels the demo was over. I bought the full version with the little amount of Amazon coins I had. When I started I had the option to draw my character. At first I thought it had to be a person but later realized it didn't. This being so it opens a wide range of things to draw opening creative options for kids or adults of all ages.
B000PMFS2I|5.0|Wonderful item, I will be buying more like it in the future.  The product was as expected and was as advertized.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Great story line filled with intrigue from the law side as well as the personal nuances that keep you coming back for more!
B009C7JS14|5.0|good design, solid info. spot on!!! almost instant info, which could not be more helpful Highly recommended, with the constant weather changes.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Keeps you watching and wondering who is really what the seem or not seem. All characters are quite compelling. Excellent!
B00A2H9P98|5.0|Great action movie. Lots of action and suspense. The main characters especially Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx are great. Good ending too.
006202406X|1.0|The first two books in the series were AMAZING & I was so excited to see how Roth finished it off.  This book was such a disappointment. I love a happy ending so this was not my favorite.
B00FAI2IUM|1.0|This game is horrible!!! It takes at least a day to download the thing just to play the game. I've had it for 2 days now and have not even played the game. Instead of downloading to 100 it downloads to 1000. And when its at 700 it stops!!!!! Unless you have no time, DO NOT get this game.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Have to wait days sometimes, before level will open up. It should be called cash collection! Its poker with all the money going to the house! Very disappointed.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Normally I'm not a fan of dramas, and wasn't sure what this movie was about before watching...but I found myself embedded in this story completely.  Such a unique story.
B001IKKMCW|5.0|This has always been my favorite movie! Can't say anything bad about this item! After so many years, I still love it!
B00FXMGI0G|5.0|Great Movie!  Enjoyed it thoroughly.  Bruce & the gang deliver once again an action packed movie full a twists and turns.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Fun and easy to play...yet not to easy! :) Just wish weapons were easier to aquire! But still lot's of fun!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Entertaing and not too difficult. It is a good game to pass time, makes you think about it. Keeps you intersted.
B00EVW04PE|4.0|We men like to see stuff get blown up from time to time, this movie did a lot of that, the playback quailty was good. I enjoyed it
B0012CH350|5.0|Perfect fit above my expectation. The only thing I had to turn the brand away from view. Worth the money
B002ZG980U|5.0|Awesome movie...I could not wait to own it.  It was sooooo complex, I had to watch it several times....I enjoyed each time.
B008MN6WP4|1.0|Because they sent a disk that won't play in the US. I had ordered an American version and they sent one that won't play in the Us, So if I could give a zero rating I would. I am very unhappy with this crappy company.
B003ODL004|5.0|Huge fan of movie and the music.  The music was sooo haunting in this movie, I could not get it out of my head....Hans Zimmer is awesome!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I hated this book.  It is very poorly written.  The characters are Bella and Edward in a different situation.  She is clumsy and unsure of herself.  He is gorgeous--her words.  She can't believe he is into her.  He has a secret.  He tells her he can't stay away from her anymore, and she says &#34;Then don't&#34;.  That is verbatim a Twilight scene.  And they raise their eyebrows at everyone incessantly.  Is there no other way to look at a person?  I kept hoping for some redemption in the ending, but it just abruptly stopped.  I can't believe I even finished it.  Terrible book.  I still can't believe it is a best-seller.
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|Lots of good songs on this album; very cool sound.  FGL is starting off strong.  Cruise of course is their most popular song off the album, but there are quite a few other good ones.
1612930425|5.0|I just simply and absolutely love, love this book.  I have wanted to read it since I saw the movie and have to say the books are always better.
0061186473|5.0|Nobody does fiction, humor, fantasy better than Neil Gaiman.  This is a children's book but you can always use the excuse that you want to make sure it's suitable for your children.  Shipping was great and the price good. My 9 year old nephew loves it. (He doesn't know that I read it first and has promised to let me read it the next time I see him.)
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|My whole family loves Pixar and especially Monsters Inc. So of course they love the prequel! Everytime I put this movie on they are glued to the TV! And I use to purchase movies on Itunes for my kids but now I'm going to do it exclusively on Amazon because I don't have to download it onto my Ipad and just use wifi to watch it. There's not much room left on my Ipad these days ; )
B0012QRPU4|5.0|I'm 65 years old and when Breaking Bad first came out in 2008 my husband and I said pass not even seeing one show.  In October this year, I was housesitting for my daughter and watched the first episode on Netflix, when I left 3 days later I was 24 episodes in. Oh my gosh, every episode grabs you and shakes your socks off. Well written, well directed, well acted. Kudo's to all the cast and crew,
B00BWQW73E|4.0|A good journalistically balanced insight into Amazon's success and it's Ceos foresight and vision. A not always flattering view of how they both operate.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Beautfully written and a poignant story.  A tough topic but not presented in a melo-dramatic style.  Through the pain:  growth, love and a future evolves.  A memorable read.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Was one of the best games I ever played but then for some reason I kept getting adds for new stuff but I did not get anything!?!?!?!
B00B89WXYS|5.0|Been a Onerepublic fan for a while now, but this is their first album that I've bought. I like almost all the songs. Ryan Tedder always has some interesting and meaningful lyrics in his songs. He's very talented.<br /><br />Off the top of my head, tracks 1, 2 are pretty catchy and upbeat. The last track &#34;Preacher&#34; grew on me, as did a couple of others I can't remember now. I will continue to listen and support them. I just wish they also included the bonus track that was offered off iTunes version.
1423141997|5.0|This book is great because it gives so many good details and Rick Riordan writes about these kids that have powers and fight like Greeks and Romans the kind of stuff that some people have no idea about, so it's so fantastic and wonderful to read and for me it was very educational. I learned a lot about Greek and Roman history and about their gods,heroes,and monsters.Rick Riordan always gives good character trates and details so that it feels like the characters are real.<br /><br />The monsters seem so evil that they pop out so you start to believe that the gods,monsters, and heroes are right there with you reading with you or it feels like your fighting monsters with them or that you have powers,but he does all that and makes it funny<br /><br />So should you read it? Yes you should! It has all the good trates of a good book description, dialog,lots of action, inner thinking, setting, feeling and much more! So when I read this book I feel happy,sad,mad,amazed,and surprised all combined! So in summary READ THIS BOOK!
B00C74SHRK|3.0|Starts extremely well, but then goes on and on and on..... Overwritten, and too many tedious accounts of drug or alcohol related wipeouts. A very, very good writer, but self-indulgent and undisciplined. Will still sell huge numbers.
B00EW9GQR6|2.0|I personally like her older music.  This album profoundly shows Lady Gaga's Ego and should be an disappointment to her fans.  I have heard better music at funerals on Christmas day.
1939416205|2.0|I love the plot, however everything is poorly written and so cliche.<br /><br />The main character is constantly complaining/feels like he is destined for more than tending flocks, yet his family keeps putting him down, so right away you know something is going to happen to make him special. I like surprises. This book is extremely predictable. In addition to that, there are a total of THREE female characters in the book. And on top of that only ONE is ever named. The other one is referred to as &#34;The Queen&#34; and the third is just a barmaid who the main character is almost forced to sleep with. I like the character who does have a name, but when it comes to standing up to her mother she just cowers in the corner. Like, fight back! Teenage girls don't simply throw tantrums when they don't get their way. The author definitely underestimates the things this character can pull off. I know, I know, character choices. I just feel like it should be more clear why characters make these choices in the first book. I don't want to give too much away (if you decide to read it) but knowing this character and the position she's in, the decision to not fight back doesn't make sense for her character.<br /><br />The plot kept me hooked to finish the book and to want to read more, but the writing and the characters pissed me off so much that I don't want to invest money into this series to read the rest.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It is a continually riveting story which also shows us how some people lived back then! Can't wait for #4.
B0017QSZW6|5.0|I enjoy history programs ... even if some of the events may not be actual.  Good acting and the Tudors give some evidence on how it would be to live then.  Candles for lighting, lots of heavy clothing, etc.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is one of my favorite games!!! You would love it . Download the game now!!! You wont regret! :)
B0058YPILY|5.0|Wife Loves the series....She watches Criminal minds on TV all the time and still watches the DVD's.Shes a fanatic aboout watching
159514188X|5.0|This book is amazing. It's about Hannah Baker and her suicide, but it's also much more than that. It's about actions, and how they can affect others.
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|Wife loves all of criminal minds. Watches over and over and over again and again. She never tires of the show
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|Boring to me, but I know others who liked it. I quit after a hundred pages. I usually like King.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Fabulous book on so many levels....sociologically, spiritually - so many different personalities all intertwined....great story.....fabulous read...didn't want it to end.
B009MB682W|4.0|Nice collection of the James Bond movie main title music from all the EON production films through Quantum of Solace.  These are all the original songs, which is nice to have in one collection.  It even includes the main theme for OHMSS in addition to &#34;We Have All the Time in the World&#34; by Louis Armstrong (which is the only OHMSS song most collections seem to have).  The only issue is that it does not have the main theme for From Russia With Love, only the ending title version by Matt Monroe.  The main title is dynamic and deserves to be included.
B00479SVBU|3.0|It does what it says it does, but the sound quality seems to be thin or hollow, not a full rich sound.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I was surprised how much I liked this movie. They kept the story very lean and focused on the non-stop action without throwing in an out of place sub plots or romantic endeavors. Warning, it is very graphic.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I was not as invested in the series after I started reading the third book, it's still a great read, just lost my steam.
B001EBWINQ|5.0|One of the top 10 movies of all time.  Released on the cusp of our entering WWII, it captures what must have been the feelings of so many Americans as they watched the Nazis bulldoze Europe.  Bogart is at the top of his game; Bergman portrays the smart, beautiful and torn lover of two men with great sensitivity, Claude Rains is impeccably French, and the Nazi colonel could not be a better scoundrel.  So many memorable lines.  The &#34;Marsellaise&#34; scene still gives me goosebumps, and I've seen this movie too many times to count.  Perhaps it's because I'm a baby boomer and WWII was the defining event in my parents' lives, but I never get tired of seeing this classic.
0307743721|4.0|Well written but too dark for me.  So little joy and life is full of joy.  She is a master of the spiral story that folds back on itself.
0385537131|5.0|I love everything John Grisham writes, and this interesting tale is no exception as Jake Briggance anticipates his next really big case.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great and fun just like the Facebook version. Nice to play on my kindle instead of the laptop. Such a fun and addicting game
B00992CF6W|4.0|Awesome but please add every thing it has on x box like a rollercoaster act pumpkins and everything because it is not really fair. Please add the things so yea
B005GY0Y8S|2.0|Mr. Kiernan-Lewis is obviously not much of a fan of the French.  That's the vibe I get from this book and from the preview of the next.  In this book, there seems to be some ambiguity in the relationship between Maggie and Laurent.  It seems like she just puts up with him rather than loves him. And why don't we find out how she deals with the issue of who he turns out to be?  The author does not cast the French folks in either book in a good light.  Being French myself, I felt slightly insulted.  I probably won't be reading any more of this author's books for this reason.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|My husband read it and says it is Stephen King's best book in years. He highly recommends it to potential readers.
B00G91Z8AQ|4.0|The movie was overall great but I thought this purchase would come with special features otherwise I would have  just purchased the standard definition.
006202406X|4.0|Finished Allegiant: I think my 16-yr-old self would've hated the ending, but being 24 I think it's a bold and noteworthy move from Roth. Really well done series and a serious young adult novel.
141694737X|5.0|My 15 month old loves the flaps in this book and finds the actual story entertaining enough.  I do however wish that once you opened each flap, it actually says the name of the animal.  That would be a great feature for when she gets older, to read it to herself, although I guess by then, we'll have been reading it for long enough for her to already know!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I have loved the music to Les Mis forever. When I saw this version in the movies, I knew I had to have it for my at home collection. Becasue they did all the singing in real time, not dubbed later, made this a real treat.
B00DWFQ2N4|5.0|I've been a Justin Timberlake fan since 'NSync!  I love this album even better than 20/20 experience 1 of 2!
1444737112|5.0|I read this book when a friend was visiting from England. Such an uplifting story. It was the perfect book to give as a present to a friend who is a nurse and cat lover.
0060245867|5.0|A young boy begins his day by offering a little brown mouse a cookie.  No longer happy with that, the mouse wants more; a cup of milk to quench his thirst, a napkin to wipe his face, a mirror to make sure he looks okay and so on.  All common sense activities that take them on a journey around the house.  Except by the end of the day the boy is worn out, the house is somewhat of a mess and the cycle begins again.<br /><br />This is a cute childrens' picture book that teaches young boys and girls about sharing and caring for others.  First published in 1985, this is a story that never grows old.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This is the easiest way to brush up on any language you have studied in the past. The lessons are very user friendly. With the owl sending you an email everyday to remind you to study, it appears the\\"teacher\\" cares about you.
B00F87ZUYG|3.0|This season is so disappointing. It's moving rather slow and I feel like the overall direction of the season is very unclear (what is the conflict?).
B000VK99Z6|5.0|There's nothing better than Simon Pegg and Nick Frost together.  This movie is loaded with intrigue and laughs.  And a goose.<br /><br />You cannot go wrong with this movie.  Buy it now.
B00867HDTA|4.0|Extremely fun game of flicking the soccer at the goal.  Not quite as good as Flick Golf, but more fun than I would have expected.
B005UT29Z0|1.0|Very slow. Predictable. Completely inane. Such a waste of good acting talent. Seems like the story was written by a 12 year old
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|Loved this book, the best I've read in a very long time!! Interesting & quirky characters, I laughed out loud a few times too
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Really good movie! It had a lot of twists and turns and it kept me glued to see what would happen next.
B00D2CYU2W|4.0|I've never thought of Michael Douglas as much of an actor. Douglas and Harrison Ford rely on a deadpan delivery that may be appealing to some but is more vaudeville then serious acting.  Actually they are more like character actors because they never change.<br /><br />However, Michael &#34;is&#34; Liberace when he sits down at the piano and  starts playing &#34;Begin the Beguine&#34;. This is how I remember Liberace when my grandmother and I watched his tv show on our 21-inch B & W in the 50's.  &#34;Grandmother&#34; (who also played piano in church) loved herself some Liberace while dissing Clara Ward for being sacrilegious just because she whooped and hollered and jumped all over the stage while singing gospel.<br /><br />Pianist Randy Kerber brings tears to my eyes when he dubs &#34;Begin the Beguine&#34; because it is incredibly beautiful, uplifting, and much too short. Michael Douglas and Liberace are a perfect fit.
B00FVVR2ZO|5.0|I think free games are the best. I love mystery manor and play it everyday. so keep these great games coming
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|good detail on operations.  love affair poorly structured.  Jack Jr. not that stupid.  Good to see the good guys win.
B008V8FVTI|4.0|I usually don't watch this genre but really liked this movie.  It held my interest from beginning to end.  I felt so sorry for those boys and glad they got even at the end of the movie.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Chromecast works fine with supported apps like youtube and Netflix. However while stream ok ng videos from other sites there is an audio lag.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|Forced myself to read the first 15% (kindle), but like a bad movie, just had to stop before I wasted any more time.
B009CF3MEK|5.0|I had never seen The Great Gatsby, but always wanted to. I missed the 2013 movie with Leo De Caprio at the theater and thought I'd watch this 1974 version with Robert Redford. It is wonderfully entertaining. The young Redford amazing.  I don't see how this year's movie could be any better. I loved it!
B005PR422K|4.0|Eric Reis helped me to view my new startup not as a daunting task but as an exciting experiment that relishes on making each moment count. Eric Reis helps explain the creation of start-ups applicable to the times. That is - fast, turbulent and uncertain. Although this is directed at startups I believe this is a book for even the most settled corporations out there as well.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|An excellent movie starring Denzel Washington. I'll watch it more than once.  Highly recommend buying this movie. You will want it in your library.
B00GOQ9M4O|5.0|Awesome, one of the better episodes in a long time. It'll be interesting to see how it ties into the main storyline/characters.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The easy read and great description made this book uplifting and revealing. I would recommend this to all who may be curious about what happens when someone is in a comma.
B00F88U4J6|4.0|Does almost everything it claims.  The only failing is on some of the older MOBI files.  The ones you purchased from Mobipocket before they were acquired by Amazon don't open properly.  But MR+ handles newer MOBIs, EPUBs, &  PDFs fine.  Also, MR+ lets you store your books on an external SD card even if you're running Jelly Bean.  It also plays nice with Dropbox.
B00EEDJHXA|5.0|I enjoy wasting time, sometimes and this one is good for just that. Not to challenging, so you do not hurt your brain...
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|THIS IS MY MOST FAVORITE SHOW...................WE WATCH IT WHILE WE ARE EATING DINNER. MY FRIENDS WATCH IT ALSO SO WE GET TO DISCUSS IT AND RANT AND RAGE ABOUT WHO WE LIKE THE BEST.
B002ZG98LO|5.0|&#34;Predators&#34; is the third film in the &#34;Predator&#34; trilogy (director Robert Rodriguez didn't take the &#34;Alien Vs. Predator&#34; films into account), and is certainly one of the most interesting films in the trilogy.  It's about a group of killers who are placed on an alien (no, not that kind of &#34;Alien&#34;) planet, and are forced to fight for their lives against a newer, stronger breed of Predators.  It stars Adrian Brody (&#34;The Piano&#34;), Danny Trejo (&#34;Machete&#34;, &#34;From Dusk Til Dawn&#34;), Topher Grace (&#34;That '70s Show&#34;, &#34;Spiderman 3&#34;), Alice Braga (&#34;Blindness&#34;), and Walton Goggins (&#34;Justified&#34;).  I highly recommend it!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Funny, great actors, and even better story. You never know what is going to happen. You need to watch this one.
B0067QPVJ6|4.0|&#34;The Thing&#34; is a prequel to &#34;John Carpenter's The Thing&#34;.  It's about a group of Norwegian, British, and American scientists, who find an unusual organism and an unusual space-craft.  Chaos ensues.  Mary Elizabeth Winstead (&#34;Black X-Mas&#34;, &#34;Live Free or Die Hard&#34;) turns in a wonderful performance;  however, the special effects are not as gritty and grim as the original.  I still recommend the film, though.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|So far I really like the game and the graphics are great. It works well so far on my Kindle HD. I would recommend this game to all ages.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love playing hidden object games, but more I love when there is a constant change to screens, I just wish I could earn helpers like hints, etc a little quicker.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|Just a so so, extra violent Bond edition.... and the story made no sense.<br />It was like a story was written and they they thought to use Flemming's Bonds characters.<br />3 Stars is generous.
B000FC12SM|4.0|A lot of the content of this book is wordy, and I found myself skimming a lot. However, there are MANY great words of wisdom and I feel so much more knowledgeable after reading this book. My relationship thrives now because of what I picked up in this book. So while parts of it are painfully annoying, (seriously, how many times do you have to use the Mars/Venus metaphor), give it a go and see it you can learn anything!
B00FQPHOPI|2.0|This was the second time I watched the movie and it was very boring. The move has little to no re-watch value.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|Love almost every song on this album.  It totally rocks!  Some of the lyrics are very, very pretty.  I saw the band when they toured and they are really sweet.  Makes me like their music even more.
1451666179|5.0|Barrel of laughs. I've never read the Author's blog so nothing is redundant to me. Anyone who has dealt with a pet, being a child, having a parent, suffered from depression... well everyone who has lived can relate to the topics contained in this book. It is a gut-bustingly funny as all get out book. Better than smoking something. I can't make it through a single page without howling so hard that I can't continue and I'll re-read the page and wooo-hooo, it's like the piece of corn under the refrigerator (you'll have to read the book to understand that reference) the cycle of laughter is on! I can sooo relate to the content and it is more than refreshing, it's pure unadulterated JOY! I have never enjoyed a book this much. I look forward to more from this author.
0545123267|3.0|This writer has another series about animals that I really like.  This is more like the Twilight series and I am so not a fan of those books.  So, sorry to the writer, but I need to give it a low score.
B003L20ICE|5.0|I love this movie which is I bought it.  IT IS A FUNNY MOVIE THAT MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD .
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love this app!  Now I can continue reading my book while on the go without having to take my Kindle with me.  Love being able to sync my progress with all my devices.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|I missed this show when we had cable TV and started watching it when we &#34;cut the cable&#34;.  It's slick and engaging.  The characters are very well cast, the back stories a bit thin but just enough to give a break from the main story line.  I look forward to watching the rest of the seasons.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Amy Pond and the 11th Doctor begin their relationship.<br /><br />Matt Smith's doctor is quite different from David Tenant's. Tenant is still my favorite Doctor, but Smith is very fun to watch. Smith's doctor is more humorous, in a nearly slapstick fashion. He had me laughing nearly right away. It took me a couple of episodes to fully accept him as the new Doctor, but he goes on to own the role. I think the next doctor will have a very hard time doing the same.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Another show that I passed on when we had cable but am thouroughly addicted to now - even my husbad like this one!  Not at all what either of us expected.  Definitely has more to it than just a suburban house wife having to go back to work because her husband went to jail.  Each of the characters is well developed and the back stories as engaging as whatever the prime one is for an episode.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|So many questions answered in this season. It's really fantastic. The 11th Doctor, Amy, Rory and River all step up their performances.  The scripts, directions and special effects are excellent. This is one of the best shows on television hitting its peak.
B00GH4R95C|2.0|Just a lot of fighting and throwing stuff around.  Definitely the worst superhero movie I have seen in a while.  It was boring.
0811879542|5.0|No wonder that this book has been on the NYT Best Seller list for over 3 years!  The book is very clever and engaging... even for a very young child.  This \\"alternative\\" to technology puts a book that can be manipulated and puzzled over into the hands of the child.  Its dance of color and interplay with seeming to \\"make things happen\\" grips interest.  This book can stimulate the child's own creative exploration of design.
B000089RVX|5.0|Not my favorite artist, but I purchased this as a gift.  My friend loved it and was very pleased with the gift.  I would definitely buy this again for a gift.
B0001Z37HM|5.0|This is a great old B movie. I liked it as a child and am glad to add it to my collection as an adult. The purchase arrived quickly and as promised.
0545128285|5.0|Definitely not my taste in reading, but I purchased this for my sister.  She loved the story - huge Harry Potter fan.  Thanks for quick shipping!
B00BWQW73E|4.0|Good reading, very well detailed, although I think the book could have done without the &#34;biological father&#34; section, which is really just here to bring some human drama into the book
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|this game is boss. it needs a crossbow that is worth money.$15000 and a compound bow too. then my life is complete.
B00B10DZQE|5.0|Inspiring movie.  We liked the fact that it was a docu - drama and it gives another great example of how nice guys finish first.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|This is one of those rare albums that I originally bought for one song and gleefully discovered that all of the songs on it were great to listen to. I am so glad to have this!
B006LSZECO|2.0|The author had me until the part where the reader finds out what happened to the missing wife, and then the plot became ridiculous. If the wife had been taken by aliens, I'd have found it more credible than what the author was asking her readers to believe. I'm willing to suspend my disbelief somewhat for a work of fiction, but this was beyond the pale. I can't say more as I'd give it away for those who haven't read it yet, but after I finished this book I decided that I'd probably never read another book by this author. It was just that stupid.
B00BZW5W3W|2.0|She looked like she could sing, so I brought the cd. I think that she was holding back with her voice, which is not good, cause God gave you this gift to give your all, and not to hold back. I was disappointed with the songs. I thought that it could of been better, since she can sing.
B0095VPBM2|5.0|Cheap and fast processor. 3.4 ghz dual core with sufficient graphics for watch videos with hd quality and all for less than 50 dollars! It comes with heat sink and pre-applied thermal paste.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|If you liked the book, you will like the film. The book is better, in my opinion.<br />The movie follows the book fairly closely, but lacks the character detail of the book, which is unavoidable, I suppose. The only problem with reading the book first, then watching the movie, is that if you enjoy the movie, you cannot be sure how good the movie is as a standalone experience. But, in my opinion, reading the book first is always best.
1596177373|5.0|These are so awesome, Burton's own characters instead of the ones everyone instantly thinks of when thinking of him and his work. They shipped super quick too! Ordered on Friday found them in my mailbox on Monday! :)
1426308469|5.0|I bought the National Geographic for little kids for my granddaughter and the book is excellent. The quality is wonderful. I am very pleased with this seller and would deal with them again.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|this is a nice app however, i wish that they did not put a timer on the &quot;lives&quot; when you restart a round. i realize  that they want you to purchase more lives but it's frustrating when you want to continue to play and have to wait on a timer.
B00881PTRC|3.0|The game is easy and satisfying to play. It's a standard hangman game.<br /><br />My problem with this app is the sound. I want some sound, some indication when I've gotten a correct letter or word. But the music is so loud and annoying... and the sounds effects are so loud and annoying. There is no way to adjust the volume.<br /><br />Also, when you're playing, if you want to change the sound options, you lose all progress in the game. That sucks!
B00CNQ7CRI|1.0|In the first Bridget Jones, it was fun reading about her weight problems, even fun seeing them drink but you do grow up and I find the beginning part so ooo bad.  she seems like a bad mother and drinks like a fish  If Renee Z takes this part she is desperate.
B00CGNYDIE|2.0|I uninstalled HexLogic almost immediately. The game was easy, and required some mental acuity, which was nice... but in the end it simply wasn't that interesting. I got the first picture done, and just didn't care. Maybe it needs to be harder? More steps? I don't know, but it wasn't for me.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Bought this for my older mother..this is the music of her day and Vince does a great rendition of these classics. If your a new country listener you will fall in love with Vinces vocals, also this will open you up to the old iconic songs back in the day. Glad Vince and Paul Franklin corroberated to make this album!
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|King Oddball is fun, easy, and a great time waster. The learning curve is quick, and the game plays well on my kindle fire... I know I have it for my android phone, but haven't gotten it loaded on that yet. I highly recommend this game!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I love the storyline and the cast.  I wish more episodes were available each season.  Can't wait till the new season starts in January
B000I9TY4G|5.0|Serenity. The movie that caps the end of Firefly. It is awesome. I highly recommend watching the series of Firefly and this, they are just great entertainment.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|LOVE it! Love playing at my own pace. It is very addicting!!! Just wish that it would show me which Facebook friends actually played the game so that I could add them.
B008D28HYS|5.0|This game is quite fun. I am addicted. The amount of content is good.<br />Sometimes I wish there was some type of hint system, but that's just my laziness speaking.<br />Also the logic that runs in the background determining when you have completed certain portions seems to be a substantial battery drain.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Love John Grisham writings.  Would love to see this one made into a movie.  With the right actors it would be great.
B0048WQDIE|5.0|I first read Catch-22 in high school AP english, and fell in love with it instantly. With my new Kindle, I decided to get some of my favorite books I read growing up, and this novel did not disappoint.<br /><br />In this novel, Heller presents a wide variety of characters to root for and root against. He lampoons military bureaucracy, the free market, and government socialism with equal fervor in a way that is never less than interesting. The constantly shifting focus on different characters can be a little grating for the first few chapters, but by chapter 8 Heller finds his groove.<br /><br />I cannot recommend that you read this book enough.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Great movie, really enjoyed it, would recommend for anyone wanting to see a funny clean movie. Loved it very much
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I am addicted to Angry Birds and I am not a youngster. I love to play these games. If I cannot sleep I take my Kindle to bed and I play until I fall asleep.
0231161174|4.0|I have enjoyed the book, and I would definitely recommend it to novices and experts. I am a DNA methylation professional, I work on molecular mechanism of DNA methylation. I bought the book to have one place reference for the phenotypic aspects of epigenetics.  I think that the author did an excellent job of balancing the text for different types of readers. The author gives the names of the researchers that did some key discoveries, so the interested reader can always go to google.scholar and pubmed for the original publications. The simple language, numerous comparisons and explanations makes this book readable to the people without expertise in epigenetics, but also to an average graduate with BSc degree.<br /><br />The book is not for people interested in molecular aspects of DNA methylation, but it does not need to be, since such text would not be for a wide audience. My only critique would be that the author should add few more figures, that could make the text bigger pleasure to read and browse. If there are about 10 more drawings in the text I would give it full five stars. I have no doubt that with rapid development of epigenetics, this book will come in newer editions. With few additional drawings, it will be a five star read. One missing figure could be changes in DNA methylation through embryonic development and gametogenesis. Congratulations to the author,  Cheers to all readers.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I liked it a lot but there is a flaw towards the end. I can't say what it is, but if you watch Law and Order or other mysteries, you've experienced it. Otherwise, the writing is first rate.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|This movie had me laughing my socks off.  Great anmation and content.  The movie keep you interested the entire time whole time.  New twists and turns throughout thing.  Made you smile while eating popcorn and hot cocoa.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great writing and a unique approach. No stereotypes here. Rich characters and a moving story kept me glued. Great job.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Very poignant, insightful view not only of death, but of life, the way we impact others and the universe. Hazel really embodies her middle name, grace. She and her parents showed tremendous grace in a situation beyond their control.
B00F2362IE|1.0|Will not work on the Kindle.<br />I installed it on my Kindle for my grandson and he loved it. The only problem is that it takes forever to load and it locks up constantly. I took it off and reloaded it but it still will not run. Had to take it off and leave it off
0688091717|5.0|Just recently introduced to Elmer the Elephant series.  Just love the story and how he embraces his uniqueness.  We should all be so lucky
B004OR199G|5.0|There is so much good nutritional information in this book by Kris Carr. It's great to know not only what foods are beneficial to your body, but why there are beneficial. Her writing style is humorous and refreshing. I consider her book a great reference and have already adopted &#34;juicing&#34; to my daily regimen. Everyone needs a copy!
B00DIFARQ6|5.0|One of the most real simulator games for Android. Makes my pulse race every landing. Give her a try!!! You will not regret it.
B00FLDG42Y|5.0|Just More Proof....that this is the best rock band EVER! After 40 years they just keep getting better as musicians, performers, artists, and human beings. AMAZING Music from Amazing People...Simply the BEST!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so much fun! Its challenging at some points which makes it even more addicting! I would reccomend it to anyone!
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This is the kind of book that is hard to put down.  The story is well written and the characters are very believable.  I did think that the ending was somewhat overdone, but on the whole I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to others.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I was skeptical of this first, but now I am hooked on American Horror Story. Loved every season and third season is turning out good as well. I think the first season is the best!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is amazing. I couldn't put it down. I would suggest that you read it and if you don't agree it's the best possible Science Fiction b took ever written. This book will remain one of the most interesting, amazing, compelling books I, Elliot, have ever read.
B00A6RCSKC|3.0|Per my 7yo, When he played it he liked it.  But now he has others games he likes more and has removed the game.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I've this game, but there's an update as of today and I can't get my Kindle Fire HD to update.  I've rebooted and tried to go online instead of my app store, but nothing works.  Help!!!!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This is one of the many games my boys have played and then moved on to the next one.  My 7yo says when he played it he really liked it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The app shows that it has been updated but I tried deleting it and downloading it again but it still is on the Halloween version. Please get the update to work
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I would play the game for its,great traffics, wonderful game play, and its my own personal  princess well that is what I named her but you should totally agree with me. So I recommend that you should get this game.
B00BXDOSXS|5.0|Great app plays every type video possible. I been looking for a<br /><br />  Player that works , and most didn't play the sound of the movie only the picture was showing. And I came across this app by luck now it's working with my movies solid. It's a better app than most out there.
0307987647|5.0|It is a GREAT story and the person reading it brings life to the characters. I would recommend this book to all of my friends.
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|I got this game as a free app of the day. It is absolutely beautiful and engaging. It's like a fun and good looking angry birds cousin. The music sets a perfect tone and the overall retro feel makes it a joy to play. Buy it now!
B00BQU12GE|3.0|It's the great old songs, but the sound is outright terrible. Much worse than the 2005 album. I can't even make out whether the new guitarists are any good since they are so far in the background of what sounds like all kinds of reflections. It really sounds like a bootleg, and one recorded from halfway up a tiled hall in the back of the club.<br /><br />Rhapsoy fans, such as myself, need to buy. However, if you don't own the 2005 live album yet, get that one first.<br /><br />To clarify, this is the first album without Luca Turilli. Also to clarify, I know I'm more sensitive to sound than others, so YMMV.
034580404X|5.0|i've heard a lot of good commentaries here in Mexico City related to this book, so I decided buy it.
0670024856|2.0|I've read all of Gilbert's writing and believe she's a gifted, articulate, highly descriptive author, but in this book, she simply doesn't know when to stop. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised by her obsession with the \\"male member\\" throughout this novel since her other books have featured a similar limelight, but the frequency and detail feels excessive and jarring - honestly, I can know that Alma has a taste for blow jobs without reading floral prose about about her giving them, or fantasizing about giving them, or masturbating while fantasizing about giving them.<br /><br />I was a bit surprised by Gilbert's seeming inability to edit her own work: what could have been a compelling, character-rich story is made interminable by pages of unnecessary detail and a need to demonstrate vast knowledge on obscure subjects. On one hand, I truly admire Gilbert's moxie in releasing a 500+ page book in today's reading climate. On the other, having slogged through it, it's irritating to have devoted my limited time to so much ephemera: maybe someone could come up with an abridged version for people who simply want the storyline. It would probably be about one-third the length.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use evernote with the &quot;getting things done&quot; method of management and it has been great. The app always works and I love it!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|good game so far. only on level four. seems likes good clues for the average gamer. nice colors. try it!
0061537969|4.0|I loved this book.  The dog narrating the story was so good and accurate with how a dog's thought process went.  There were many truths of human nature.
B00B4804KS|5.0|Had a problem but it was quickly resolved.  Great service and a nail biting show to boot.  Forgot how you are on edge waiting for it because of the 3D your in it.  No where to hide or run.
1451666179|5.0|Thinking laughter is always the best medicine (at least according to Readers Digest), I bought this book as a gift to give to a friend who recently went through brain surgery as a pick me up.  I have been reading Allie's blog since my sister told me the running track story reminded her of me; so I flipped through the book to confirm it was just as funny as her blog and now I must purchase more books for everyone in my life who need to uncontrollably laugh and perhaps wet themselves in the process.  I scared my son with my hyena like guffawing and he thought I was sad with tears running down my cheeks.  I want to rip out some of the pictures and decorate my cubicle at work with them to brighten my days.  Whoever gave this book one star is a bitter person and needs to lighten up ALOT.  Thank you for putting your amazingness in a book I can thrust in friends' faces to make them see your great drawings and humor.  I can't wait for the next chapters in Allie's life.
B009GI8J1O|5.0|David Mitchell's incredibly unique writing style creates a series of settings that speak as loud as the incredibly in depth characters that exist throughout the novel. Jumping from past to present to future, Mitchell shows a connect between what has been, what is and what could be and how no matter how much time passes, we as humans still have more in common than we could ever hope to realize. A beautifully written work.<br /><br />The six different stories in this book all link together in a unique and subtle way. Starting with the Journal that Adam Ewing wrote during his run-in with his stowaway on his journey home, and moving creatively to a young composer, Mr Frobisher, who read his journal and found it to be life changing. All the way ahead to the Sunmi who stood up to the oppressive government and changed the course of humanity, this book does an amazing job of showing that though times may change drastically, freedom, love and friendship will forever remain steadfast.<br /><br />The most beautiful point that I feel came from this book is when Ewing and the stowaway are have conversation in the boat and Adam Ewing is asking why the slave picked him, and why he shouldn't just give him up to the captain (which would have resulted in the death of the slave) and the slave points at each of their eyes and says, &#34;That is all you need&#34;. I think this is a beautiful idea, that as humans, all we really need to show empathy and be kind is eyes, to look into the eyes of others. This book represents a version of all that has been and can be by creating such believable and captivating settings, characters, and plots.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I hate this book.  I really, really hate this book.  I loved the first two, and have been anxiously awaiting this last book to see how the story ends.  I've made it halfway through, and have finally given up.  Every other chapter changes to be told by four or tris.  Back and forth, back and forth.  I have found myself reading in a few sentences and thinking &#34;wait.  who is telling this chapter, tris or four?&#34;  Its distracting, it completely takes away from the enjoyment of this book, so much so that I no longer care how the book ends.
B00124PXW8|5.0|Dug this up for Halloween. Still a hair raising chiller to behold with real acting and a great story line plus the surprise ending.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is a wonderful clean series! The actors are all very good. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good movie that has humor and is well made!
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I missed this when it was in theaters. As always, anything Dicaprio does is worth seeing and Toby was great too.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I absolutely love Candy Crush Saga, I cant stop playing this game. The only thing that I don't like about it is when I have lives and extra moves saved, at times they have been taken away. one minute I have saved lives and extra moves and the next minute I don't.
B000QE9ERK|5.0|I either love or hate movies with Depp in them and had not seen this one so, gave it a go. It can be a bit odd at times, but it is never boring or predictable and the ending I didn't foresee. Great acting by all and location shoots scenic.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|It was exciting. The CGI was outstanding.  It left you with a could this really happen kind of feeling.  I wanted to see it again.  I recommended it to my family.
B007R11DKQ|5.0|wholesome funny and had a good sense of adventure. The main Character learned a good lessons and  made great friends on his hilarious and silly adventure, while finding out who the true love of his life was.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|The best reason of all, of course, is NO ADS!  It plays just like the PC version.  It's a great game to pass the while with.  It's definitely worth 99 cents.
B005K17RU0|5.0|App works well and provides info I am looking for at locations of interest.  Can't think of any negatives for this App.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Beautifully written. Hosseini pulls the reader into the interweaving stories of different generations of a family. Each individual story is heartfelt and intriguing. Full of powerful emotions, beautiful imagery, and great story telling, this was a read that left me wanting the book to go on and on.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great  challenging puzzles. Dissappointed only 10 levels but had a great time playing them. Fun to finally figure it out. just need more levels!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It appears (and can be) simple, but it can be quite challenging at times; and is curiously addictive.  And, hey, it's free!
B008DBF5Z8|1.0|No where did I read anywhere prior to purchase that it will not work with Surface RT or that an Apple account with credit card would be needed to download Whiteboard so that it works.  There isn't a version of the support software to support Windows RT.  IPEVO is not available except through emails to contact for questions or help.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Awsome movie, the parrt of the movie concerning the little girl will just melt your heart I love this movie will share it with friends...
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Kind of a nice quick read. Another's fictional play of the always a day late Fed s. A fun story
