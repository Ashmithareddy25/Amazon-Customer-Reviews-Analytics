B002K0WBXW|4.0|I used to love romantic comedies until the past couple of years where the quality of writing and acting has left much to be desired. So when my dear husband brought this home one night, I was quite skeptical, thinking I wasn't going to enjoy it. Well, I was wrong! \\"The Proposal\\" is a well-cast and credibly acted romantic comedy with two leads that share genuine chemistry and an ensemble cast that is quite simply a delight to watch.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock whom I have enjoyed watching in movies like \\"While you were sleeping\\" (and which I consider an all-time classic) and \\"Practical Magic\\" plays a tough as nails editor, Margaret, who is reviled by her underlings. Margaret faces a predicament when her visa expires (she is a Canadian) and faces the unpleasant prospect of being deported. She comes up with a quick fix solution - tell her boss and others that she is engaged to her assistant, an aspiring author, Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds)who is forced to go along with her plans under threat of losing his job and never being published. Before long, the pair find themselves heading to the scenic Sitka, Alaska, a beautiful seaside town where Andrew's family lives. Turns out Andrew's family is not only prominent but very wealthy, comprising dad Joe (Craig T. Nelson), mom Grace (Mary Steenburgen) and grandma Annie (Betty White, still at her feisty best). Andrew's family embrace Margaret, though Joe is cynical of their romance and is hell bent on keeping Andrew on Sitka, to take over the Paxton empire after his retirement.<br /><br />Typical of other romantic comedies, the pair soon discover common ground, and Margaret's ice queen veneer slowly thaws, and the rest of the story deals with the pair's romantic misadventures and conclusion. What made this an engaging and fun watch was the believable chemistry between Reynolds and Bullock - they truly seem at ease with each other, be it whilst engaged in verbal sparring or easy, casual banter. Betty White hams it up as Grandma Annie, and Mary Steenburgen and Craig T Nelson play their roles with conviction. The cinematography is beautiful and the dialogue is well-written, resulting in many genuinely laugh out loud moments. This is a wonderful romantic comedy that is sure to brighten up a listless, gloomy day. Highly recommended!eenburgen and Craig T Nelson play their roles with conviction.

0385504225|3.0|I'm not sure why this book has been so poorly reviewed.  It is not outstanding - it's formulaic and a bit long - but it's decent.  Any book that keeps me up late, reading more and more so I can see what happens next is worthy of three stars.  It is entertaining even if it's not as good as the Da Vinci code.  As long as one's expectations are not too high this book is enjoyable.  It is worth a read for sure.      The thing that really bothered me was that there were WAY WAY too many words in italics.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|Wow..what can I say..this guy has a beautiful harmonious voice that I could listen to all day long (and I do!). I love his video to the song Haven't Met You Yet. The way he takes the old standards and sings them is awesome. A little bit of Frank Sinatra and Harry Conick, Jr in his voice. His songs could make you swoon if you aren't careful..He has lots of good CD's, but this is my favorite..
B00000AFWW|4.0|Although hard \\"riot grrl\\" fans dissed Celebrity Skin when it was released, it was and remains one of the great grunge-era albums by any band.  With lyrically accessible and audibly pleasing songs as \\"Malibu\\" and \\"Boys on the Radio\\" (a reworking of Love's Sugar Coma apparently with signficant help by Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins) to introspect ballads as \\"Awful\\" and \\"Reasons to be Beautiful\\" CS was a departure from Live Through This. Indeed the irony of being \\"sell outs\\" wasn't lost on Love; \\"Boys on the Radio\\" is often considered an indictment of the record industry and its handling of musicians, while \\"Playing Your Song\\" pointedly discusses the very \\"selling out\\" that fans of Hole so vehemently accused the album of being the prime example.   Yet, its continued sales is a testament to its place in the recent history of music, of whatever persuasion.  In addition to the one CD versions, a number of two-CD import sets were made, with live tracks from Australia and the U.K.

0312427999|5.0|Naomi Klein gives a wealth of information from a far-left point of view which is all too seldom heard in the discussion of solutions to economic problems. Whether or not one agrees with her analysis, it should be clear to everyone that enriching the debate with more ideas is a good thing. Sadly, this seems to be the opposite of the case, and the responses to her book from right-wingers and even some who don't think of themselves as right-wingers shows that at least one idea in the book is absolutely right -- the free market disciples now are treating any ideas that differ from theirs as a pollution rather than healthy dissent. Obviously, this tendency is dangerous, and should be opposed even by people who feel closer to Friedman than Chomsky ideologically.    I agree with other reviewers who found the metaphor strained. I suspect that it was just the easiest way to sell the book (in a time when marketing departments make all the major decisions about the eventual form of a book, even a book like this can be twisted into strange postures). It is really a sustained and cogent criticism of the Washington Consensus, the history of the Chicago Boys in dismantling economies around the world and clearing the way for riches to flow into the coffers of a few wealthy individuals.     When one looks dispassionately at the facts (without the legerdemain of right-wingers, which always claims that if a left-wing government has economic growth, it was all due to the previous right-wing government, while if a right-wing government has growth, it is of course due to the right-wing government's policies -- and so on) -- if one looks at statistics, then, it seems clear that these policies immediately impoverished millions and made the poverty of the already poor markedly more intolerable.     The only argument in favor of these policies that remains is that in the long run, they have made the world richer. The trouble with this claim is that there is no way of testing its validity. Industrialization goes forward under both left and right wing governments. The likelihood is that the world would be much richer after the passage of all these years, with their attendant technological innovation and just the sheer work of billions creating capital goods -- factories, infrastructure, even education that is passed down from parent to child regardless of whether schools close. I think few people would argue that a pure Communist system would have done better economically. By stamping out mixed economies wherever they arise (except in the developed world, which obviously had a head start) the possibility of comparison has been lost. But the fact that countries like America and Germany experienced their years of greatest wealth under their most mixed, Keynesian, economies, should demonstrate that there is nothing essential wrong with the Keynesian model. Whatever else it may be, it is very far from a disaster; unless we think the 60s in America were a time of economic catastrophe.    Also, it troubles me that, while the most die-hard Western Commie will ritually apologize for Stalin's crimes and insist that the form of Communism she espouses is very very different from Stalin's -- right-wingers have absolutely no tears to shed for the people slaughtered under right-wing dictatorships. It's very easy for them, it seems, to accept mass death of their opponents. This is the best evidence that the dogmatic period -- the bloody period -- of their philosophy is still ongoing.
0385504225|2.0|It's not that it's formula, but Davinci Code + Angels and Demons = The Lost Symbol without the priests, oh wait, there's one of those too.    Chapter 1,349  \\"End it already,\\" screamed Langdon as Peter Solomon continued into the tenth condescending chapter playing like a self-help book.  \\"Sorry, Robert,\\" Dan Brown smiled, \\"my new contract pays me by the word.\\"  \\"Holy obelisk, Dan,\\" Langdon panted, \\"Even Dickens wasn't this bad.\\"    Chapter 1,514  Breathlessly Robert Langdon, the trim, deep voiced, handsome, distance swimmer used all the symbols in his mind as he struggled with the weight of all the extra pages now pressing on his chest. As his eyes began to lose focus and his breath became more labored, a buzzing started to swirl with twinkling lights around the edges of his eyes. Then suddenly, just before passing out he could clearly see the symbol. It made sense. It was before him the whole time. As his mind blacked he vividly saw the two green \\"S\\"-shapes bisected by a single vertical green line. Surround the pair was a bright red circle with a single diagonal line running from the one o'clock to the seven o'clock position, \\"That's what the symbol was saying, \\"Don't spend the money.\\"    At one point in the book, it Langdom seems destined for a permanent death, a hopeful symbol that maybe he will be killed off and there will not be a fourth book cashing in on the two previously well-written ones.    Brown spends a good third of the book defending Masonry to the point that it seems like an out-of-court settlement from the way they were smattered in other books. \\"OK, instead of paying you guys, I'll write a book that extolls your virtues,\\" agreed Brown. That or the Masons are getting a donation each time their name is mentioned.    This one is best read from a library check-out or if it's one of the freebies on your subscription. Don't spend extra. It drags, it squirms, it squiggles, but it never gets to the point -- just like a \\"Make $1,000 an hour part time at home\\" infomercial. I think there was a point in it. Wasn't there?    If you liked \\"DaVinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons,\\" you've already read \\"The Lost Symbol.\\"

1401323820|5.0|Originally intending to purchase this book from Amazon.co.uk but going to Amazon.com because of the time delay, I wanted to own HEAT WAVE because of its tie-in with the abc television series, CASTLE.  The book, purported to be written by the main character in that series, and mentioned on many occasions, is about Nikki Heat, a New York Police Department detective, whose skill is untangling murders, and who has baggage of her own.  Following her around is Jameson Rook, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author, who is intending to write an article on the NYPD and Heat in particular.  Just like Richard Castle is following around Kate Beckett, and using her as the model for Nikki Heat.  Complicated?  Somewhat, maybe, but the initial chapters were uploaded onto the abc website over the summer to keep the audience's appetite whetted.  Nobody (apart from abc) knows who the actual author is, but they've done a great job of evoking New York in the middle of a hot spell, and it's fun to see bits of dialogue and business come up from the TV series.  All in all, a book that you can read in an afternoon - if you're like me - or take your time over a weekend, then go and watch the TV series again.  Recommended.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Everything you would expect in a controller by Sony. It's the exact controller that is shipped with the PS3 units.    Although a bit expensive, I would always buy this controller over one made by a different company. Great quality controller, and built for the PS3, the system created by Sony. If you buy a controller by MadCatz or others, you don't see the same quality that this controller has.

This CD I play daily and more than once a day.
1439102813|5.0|I was a bit hesitant when a friend gave me this to read; however, since my elderly mother is slipping into dementia I thought I'd give it a try.  At first my thinking was that this would be depressing but it gripped me from the beginning.  You could feel Alice's frustration with what was happening to her and her desire to never be a burden was probably what all people with this horrible disease must feel.  Not only did it depict how Alice feels,  but dealt with the strain on children and spouses as well.  For anyone who has an elderly friend, spouse, or just wants to be riveted from beginning to end.
0807014273|5.0|The first time that I read this book, I could hardly put it down. It is truly captivating. The emphasis on finding purpose and meaning sparks something within. It makes you want to look for more in life, putting things into perspective. For example, he describes the need to find meaning in life in each moment, highlighting the need to live in the moment.     Although the story describes how Frankl's survived concentration camps, he focuses upon aspects of human nature, man's ability to persevere, and other parts of the human experience. This allows anyone to relate to such an extraordinary story. I highly recommend it.
0385504225|3.0|Ok, it would have been hard to just flat-out ignore Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol after The Da Vinci Code was so popular.  I wasn't one of the ones who had to read it immediately, so I put myself on the hold list at the library to get it whenever I got to the top.  After finishing the book, my overall reaction is... meh.  It's mildly entertaining, and I was interested to see how it would end.  But it seemed to repeat the same scene formula over and over.  In addition, it could have been at least a third shorter without losing any impact.  The best thing I can I say is that I won't have to see the movie the first weekend it opens... :)<br /><br />Brown has another novel here that's similar to Da Vinci Code, only using the Masonic legends as the secret sauce.  Robert Langdon is called by his friend Peter Solomon to deliver a speech to a group in Washington DC.  But when he gets there, he finds the meeting room empty.  A phone call sheds light on the situation... he's been tricked into coming to DC in order to help solve a mystery involving hidden clues in Washington that will reveal the ultimate \\"Hidden Word\\" in Masonic lore that will open up the Ancient Mysteries.  The mystery caller has Solomon held hostage so that Langdon will deliver.  As clues are uncovered, more and more people get pulled into the action, with the possibility that certain secrets could be revealed that would constitute a national crisis.<br /><br />So why isn't this a \\"must-read\\"?  Obviously with an author of Dan Brown's stature, you have high expectations.  After Da Vinci Code, he had a high standard to meet.  But it seems as if the hidden secret society genre has been played to extremes lately, and another novel along the same lines doesn't leave much room for new directions.  Brown has Langdon in a predictable pattern throughout Lost Symbol.  He's presented with a puzzle, he doesn't know the answer, pressure mounts, and then a revelation occurs.  Have something bad happen, and then repeat the series of actions... over and over.  Furthermore, it seems like about a third of the book in the middle covers the same ground repeatedly without advancing the story or the revelations much.  As such, the 510 pages could have been done in about 300 with much better results.  It also doesn't help that you're never quite sure where the line between truth and fiction lies in his interpretation and recitation of facts and figures.  Are there mystery basements and subbasements under the Capitol?  Did a number of major historical figures belong to Masonic societies?  Were structures like the Washington monument built with Masonic symbols in the design, or is it all just numeric manipulation after the fact?<br /><br />I don't regret the time spent reading The Lost Symbol.  I expected mind candy and entertainment, and that's what I got.  I simply think it could have been much better than it actually was.<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained From: Library<br />Payment: Borrowed... over and over.

B000FVQM2Y|5.0|This film isn't for everyone, and those with no knowledge of (or taste for) film noir and especially the Hard-Boiled Detective Fiction sub-genre will likely be confused or even bored by it. If you like either, though, you're in for a real treat.<br /><br />A high-school student gets a cryptic call from an ex, and when she turns up dead a few days later, he launches his own investigation into the matter. Matters spiral from there.<br /><br />I call this \\"hard-boiled high school\\" because it ingeniously takes a standard pulp setting and updates it to a modern high school: instead of the D.A. breathing down the detective's neck, it's the vice-principal, etc. Clever stuff.<br /><br />The plot's complexity is almost Chandleresque and requires paying attention to dialogue and background details. The dialogue is straight out of a '30s copy of that pulp classic, Black Mask magazine. Hammett would be proud, especially since some of the slang is encased in some truly witty dialogue.<br /><br />You have to like this sort of thing, of course, but if you do, it's surprisingly well-done, especially given the limited budget and that this was the director's first effort.<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of this sort of thing.
0385504225|3.0|Love his research, but irritated by his style of writing...    I've developed a method of reading his books where I skim through to find interesting facts and anything important to the storyline (this is entirely subconscious).  Might be the publishing effort where editor's say the book must have so much \\"filler material\\", but sometimes I feel like he is insulting his readers by stating the obvious over and over again and telling about every single detail of each scene. I get the \\"show dont tell\\" aspect of fiction writing, but his writing tends to go a little overboard. Each of his books could be 100-200 pages shorter and still tell the same great story.    Otherwise another great book in the series!

B000Y179KO|5.0|Perhaps more than any other single band in rock and roll history, even the Beatles, the Eagles have been through some very cataclysmic changes--not unlike the L.A. landscape that gave them their start and their inspiration.  In the 70s, they were both a fans' favorite and a favorite whipping boy for the critics (especially those at Rolling Stone).  In 1980, long-simmering dissensions exploded out and caused the group to dissolve (or so drummer and lead vocalist Don Henley thought, when he commented the only way the band would get back together would be \\"when Hell freezes over.\\").  In 1994-95, hell indeed did freeze over, and the Eagles got back together.  But it still took an enormous amount of time before they released another collection of all-new material; and in that time, they canned longtime guitarist Don Felder, who had been with the band since 1974.  Finally in 2007, after twenty-eight years, they finally gave us LONG ROAD OUT OF EDEN.    And much like what had happened with Elvis in 1969, the Eagles each individually had so much they wanted to get out there in front of the public that LONG ROAD OUT OF EDEN became a 2-CD, 90-minute epic.  Everything the band and its individual members were known for is encompassed here, with Joe Walsh's laconic attitude taking flight on \\"Guilty Of The Crime\\" and \\"Last Good Time In Town\\"; bassist Timothy Schmit doing his thing on \\"I Don't Want To Hear Anymore\\" and \\"Do Something\\"; Glenn Frey's emotional heat dominating on \\"No More Cloudy Days\\" and \\"What Do I Do With My Heart?\\"; and Henley's sociological force being kicked up a notch on the ten-and-a-half minute epic title track, and \\"Business As Usual.\\"  The band does go back into its distant past with \\"How Long\\", written by their close compatriot J.D. Souther in 1972, but only ever done onstage by the band up until this point.  Longtime session man Steuart Smith steps in for Felder on LONG ROAD; and the band's country-rock roots are also accentuated by the occasional pedal steel work of Greg Leisz, whose credits include, among others, the 1999 Linda Ronstadt/Emmylou Harris collaboration WESTERN WALL.  And on the closing \\"It's Your World Now\\", the band not only pauses to pass on what they've learned to another generation, but, in its Mariachi-tinged arrangement, they seem to pay homage to Linda and her Mexican-American roots, given that they originally formed around the Arizona-born songstress in 1971.    If indeed this 2-CD opus is the absolute final word on this group of Desperados, then it really has been a most interesting, albeit also turbulent, ride.  Much like the Beatles and the Beach Boys, the Eagles are a band that has often been duplicated in musical style, but never matched in terms of emotional impact; and LONG ROAD OUT OF EDEN may very well seal the deal for keeps now.

I kept marking the pages where the phrasing was so lyrical and well written - so I could go back and re-read it - ended up marking numerous pages. Definately goes on my Top Shelf where only a select few of my all time favorites are.  Seems like the author was born to write this piece of art to share with and move the world.
B001OQCV24|5.0|I hope no one went to 2012 expecting good science, good acting, good continuity, and good script. If you did, you went to the wrong movie.    I wasn't expecting any of that. What I WAS expecting was fun watching the the scenery getting torn apart, totally unbelievable escapes from death, and enough of a script - just enough, mind you - to provide a transition between most the most excellent CGI sections.    I got more than I expected on the CGI side. Many CGI-heavy movies give you just a few seconds of an effect, as if given time to study it you'd realize you were seeing the result of a computer chugging through the bits and bites that the technicians gave it to munch on.    2012, however, gives you enough time to admire the effects and the people behind them. Indeed, the screen is so filled with wall-to-wall action that I won't appreciate the bulk of it until I can watch and re-watch the movie on Blu-Ray.    So, here's to 2012 and Emmerich. They gave me what I was looking for in a disaster flick: disaster. I'm not going to nit pick the obvious areas because that would be viewing the movie from an angle it wasn't meant to be viewed. 2012 makes no pretense about being an art-house film, or even a \\"serious\\" mainstream release. It just gives you what you paid for: the safe fun of watching the world fall down around your ears.    Pay your money and enjoy the full value of your purchase. Have fun! That's what this sort of movie's for.
B002WXU7QU|4.0|If you saw CATCH ME AS YOU CAN starring Leo DiCaprio as the king of the white collar criminals, this series, WHITE COLLAR, is loosely based on that premise.  This time, however, everyone is fictional.  The two partners are an FBI agent and the con man in the white collar section.  This is as much breezy comedy as it is crime drama. This episode has the two of them working on an Iraqi stolen artifacts problem.  It is not earth shattering tv but it is good and entertaining.  With some work and in time, it might become even better.

1400063515|3.0|I have downloaded many of his Youtube videos and read his book twice.  The videos are good not great, however the book can become boring due to it being turgid.  The basic idea is true but the meandering train of thought causes the rereading of many chapters and then you still may not quite get the point.  Since he believes in evolution his theories all have a bias that negates many of his conclusions.  Still I would recommend reading this book as it probably will cause you to look at data from a totally different viewpoint.  Even if you already have this viewpoint it doesn't hurt to be reminded again that there is another viewpoint that most so called experts avoid and because of this are dangerous.

J.J. Abrams has re-vamped Star Trek for a mass audience appeal throwing away most of the traditional sci-fi techno babble and slow moving plots. These elements are replaced with tons of action and simple to follow diologue. A true Star Trek fan would scream bloody murder with matters such as these, but Abrams covers all the bases. He has not done away with the origional Star Trek universe the plot of this new world pays tremendous respects to it's roots with a story that is all about why the universe of Star Trek has been re-vamped beinging in the past. Along with a special appearence by the legendary Leonard Nimoy, he is the one that bridges the gap between the two worlds and passes the torch to the new cast beautifully. 'Star Trek' is the beigning of a brand new generation with an incredible young cast who will hopefully make many more Star Trek films in the coming future and who knows maybe even some new TV shows. The best part about this film is it may be looking like all the haters out there might just start to become 'Trekkies' as well.
B00003CX8Y|2.0|Neither our Blu-Ray now our DVD player will play this DVD without \\"Angle On\\" and \\"Angle Off\\" appearing repeatedly in the upper left hand corner of the screen.  I have never seen this with any other DVD I have ever watched.  Seller denied that it was a bootleg copy, but I'm pretty sure it is.  Other than the above annoyance, the movie itself is ok, but agree with some others that the colors do not seem quite right.  Dull and washed out come to mind.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Once again Disney has taken an old classic and revised it to perfection. Getting a Blu-ray/Dvd combo + BD Live all for a very low price, is outstanding.

B001AX9DT0|4.0|The title track and \\"Sarah\\" are my favorites.  Ray's voice is as rich and haunting as ever on this CD.  A solid work.  It stands up as well or better than is freshman and sophomore efforts.  This is a good sign.  I also loved the special treat, \\"Meg White\\". Ray has hit the bulls-eye and produced some of the best singer/songwriter genre music out there today.  I highly recommend this CD to any music lover...<br /><br />From the web-site:<br /><br />\\"Lauded singer/songwriter, Ray LaMontagne release his much-anticipated third album, Gossip In The Grain, on October 14, 2009 on RCA Records. Recorded with returning producer, Ethan Johns in Box, England, and touching upon a range of styles and musical settings- spanning pastoral folk, railroad blues, front porch country, and plangent balladry - Gossip In The Grain proves to be his most creative and emotionally expansive collection to date.<br /><br />Whereas LaMontagne's two previous albums, 'Trouble' and 'Till The Sun Turns Black', were largely solo affairs, with Johns serving as multi-tasking instrumentalist, Gossip In The Grain sees him joined by members of his touring band, bassist Jennifer Condos and guitarist Eric Heywood (with Johns largely handling drum duties). Along with his band members, LaMontagne is also joined on two tracks - \\"A Falling Through\\" and \\"I Still Care For You\\" - by singer/songwriter Leona Naess.<br /><br />As LaMontagne explains \\"It was time to open up a little bit more, not be quite so reserved in my choice of songs that I wanted to record.\\" Recently called by Vanity Fair 'a fresh reminder that the genuine artist is not yet an extinct species,' Gossip In The Grain reconfirms Ray LaMontagne as an artist and a craftsman without limits, a songwriter who is able to work his melodic gifts and distinctive lyricism through any of the myriad musical traditions that catches his fancy.\\"<br /><br />Buy it today.  You won't regret it.
B0029O08WA|4.0|The first time I listened to the soundtrack I hated it - I thought all the music was weird.  But, I was determined to not give in to first impression, so listened to it a few more times.  I then decided it wasn't so bad.  After listening to it even more times, I kinda started to like it.  After listening to it for the past month a couple times a week, I now actually really like the soundtrack.  I think the music is not radio-friendly perhaps, but it definately has the vibe of New Moon which is its purpose.    If you like dark and obscure music, the this soundtrack is for you.  It does not have the energy of the Twilight Soundtrack, but it certainly captures the despair and grieving the loss of love that New Moon is all about.
0618918248|2.0|This book has some interesting stuff in it, like Dawkins' discussion of the cosmological anthropic principle.  The man's sincere reverence for the evolved intricacy of the natural world is also moving.  However, this is not a rigorously argued book on the level of Dawkins' masterpiece The Selfish Gene, but an ill-tempered polemic.  Dawkins clearly feels that all religious people are dangerous idiots.  Some of them surely are, but this hyper-atheistic diatribe is no less obnoxious and possibly even more smug than anything Billy Graham could have come up with for the other side.  The flat earth creationists and the flat earth atheists, self-styled martyrs all, deserve each other.  Readers who are interested in a serious evolutionary account of religion might want to check out Darwin's Cathedral by David Sloan Wilson, or Scott Atran and Ara Norenzayan's articles on the subject.  More sympathetic to a religious perspective but still informed by evolutionary thinking are Robert Wright's The Evolution of God and Frederick Turner's Natural Religion.  Most people other than hardcore Dawkins fans and fundamentalist Christians looking for straw men to knock down will want to skip this one.
B002KDUDG6|1.0|After getting this CD, I must say I was thoroughly disappointed.  I've heard some people say he is the next Frank Sinatra.    Make no mistake - - there was only ONE Frank Sinatra.  Buble doesn't even come close to him!!!    More than likely, I will never bother to purchase one of his CD's again.  In fact, this one will be at my next garage sale.
B001SN78JO|4.0|It seems Jim Carrey has turned his attention away from being his typically goofy self including facial expressions and other silly mannerisms, and has turned to a more... not necessarily a more intelligent style of comedy, but starring in films that focus less on the goofiness.    So far it seemed to work for Jim Carrey, because the Yes Man was pretty funny.  It's about a man (Jim Carrey of course) who has to say \\"YES\\" to everything.  This includes ALL questions asked by everyone.  This can include having to say yes to his neighbor (an old lady who knows a thing or two about making love), his workmates (one of them being a Harry Potter fanatic) and his girlfriend (whom he met at a gas station while riding a motorcycle).    I do miss the old version of Jim Carrey where he was just an insanely goofy person, but with good writing to back up his behavior so the writing in those old movies had a purpose at least.  Yes Man is a very minor disappointment in that regard, but not enough to take away from all the times I was sitting there laughing while watching it tonight.      The film does a really nice job covering a variety of different locations, and having Carrey's character interact with a variety of interesting people.  I like that.  It makes the story that much more interesting when Jim Carrey has to say yes to everything.    Maybe the writers could have found funnier ways for Jim Carrey to say yes involving funnier segments and questions, but that's a small complaint because in the end this is a movie I recommend you watch with your family, and a film all Jim Carrey fans should be able to appreciate.

0385504225|3.0|I enjoy Dan Brown's books but The Lost Symbol had alot of unnecessary reading in it that could have been omitted. It was, however, interesting and held my interest to the end.  The professor in symbolism however, came off a bit short in other areas which detracted from his overall level of intelligence and I like to recognize him as having \\"smarts\\" = to the general populace...Will still look forward to Brown's next book!
0385341008|5.0|I hate being one of the herd, but I have to agree: This is a marvelous book. Not only were the characters interesting, but I also learned a lot about a time and place that were unfamiliar to me. I wish I could be friends with Juliet, Elizabeth, Isola, and just about all the rest of the characters. I almost feel sorry for the authors because I don't know how they can top this with their next book. But I'll be willing to find out.

B002PEP4SC|4.0|Starting with its corny title, this book has no pretenses and is just plain fun.<br /><br />Nikki Heat is a smoking hot woman police detective who is all business, all the time, until the police captain allows Jameson Rook, a feature writer, to tail along with her for a few months for a story he is writing on the department.<br /><br />He begins his tagalong just as a new case opens into the death of a wealthy real estate developer.  At first, Heat is annoyed by his overeagerness, flirtatiousness and the way he refuses to \\"know his place\\" as just a reporter.  Worse, his cocksure attitude and quick wit make him very popular amongst the guys at the precinct, another source of tension between he and Nikki.<br /><br />However, as the story develops, Nikki learns to appreciate Rook's many admirable qualities.  He is genuinely brave and risks his life throughout the story, tackling suspects and putting himself in harms way, both annoying and impressing Nikki. But more than that, Rook has a joie de vivre that is infectious and actually gets Nikki to relax a little and have fun, something she desperately needs.<br /><br />One small example of this dynamic is when Rook first sees Heat take down a suspect. She impressively disarms the perp, throws him to the ground, and points her gun at him. Rather than being impressed, Rook criticizes her for not having anything clever to say to him, like \\"Go ahead, make my day\\" (but not that, because it is unoriginal).<br /><br />Heat is annoyed and thinks it is an example of Rook having a juvenile attitude toward policework.  But toward the end of the story, after she gets to like Rook and loosens up a little, she comes to appreciate the value of having fun with your job.<br /><br />The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is that I found the actual \\"whodunnit\\" plot predictable. But that doesn't matter because the true entertainment in the story is the characters, not the plot.
B001G0MFOM|5.0|fantastic ending to a great series.  A \\"who done it?\\" with a confusing ending.  Lives up to the L word series expectation of excellence.  one problem is it is way too short, that is not a full season was shot.  too bad, not enough of a great thing.
B001GKJ2E8|4.0|This was a good action flick, to escape one out of dulls fill boredom.  Special effects were awesome and people should be generous at giving no less then three stars just for the effort of some who created the special effects.  Some people are so darn jealous, and nobody's that they just can't stand seeing somebody else doing what they wish they could do but never will.  I hate people who give movies a one or two star rating.  Some movies deserve a no star rating, but, these are low budget movies, nobody actors, total lousy acting, and the movie looks like it was made in my backyard. So the next person that gives this movie below a three star rating,I will be commenting DUDE ABOUT YOU!!!!!!!!!
B002C6K7NU|3.0|I was looking foward to this album, hoping they would finally put out some interesting music, but I am very disappointed. Where are the guitars??? I love Rick Medlocke but he hasn't played an interesting guitar lick in the 10 plus years he's been with Skynyrd. His big lick on each new Skynyrd album seems to be a re-working of the lick from a song, I think it was called Soldier Blue on one of his solo albums. It's a killer lick, but come on. This guy is a cool guitar picker, too. At least kick some A$$.    I understand that Skynyrd is a business and they employ lots of people from touring and merchandising so their albums have to appeal to as many people as possible, but this album turns me off. Every piece of sonic real-estate is full, there's no room for the music to breathe. It's like the instruments are competing with each other.     Another thing that turns me off, is that Ronnie sang Saturday Night Special, but Johnny has no problem promoting guns in Skynyrds name. I'm not opposed to gun ownership, but this sure seems like a ploy to sell albums. Give me the rock, keep the politics out of it.    Overall a pretty predictable lackluster effort. I want rock, not syruppy pseudo country fluff.
B002LMOCJ0|2.0|First off, I love this movie. With that said, it is not worth upgrading this film to blu-ray.  As stated in another review, this film was a low budget film shot on cheap low resolution black & white film stock.  It may as well have been filmed with a camcorder.<br /><br />The blu ray version is also way over priced.  Giving this film a blu ray \\"upgrade\\" makes as much sense as giving \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" a blu ray transfer. The source material is crap.  If you must have everything blu ray, that's fine, but wait awhile as this one will surely drop in price.
B0021L9MJG|4.0|All I can say is that Creepshow is a classic and got it's due on Blu-Ray.  The picture was great for a 25 plus year old film, and I hope that Blu-Ray keeps releasing them.
0385504225|1.0|If you like 'em, this one's for you. It follows the formula of \\"DaVinci Code\\" so slavishly, it's hard to imagine an editor not clearing his throat and saying,\\"Uh...Dan?\\" Same sado-masochistic weird villain, same follow-the-map-and-code action, same stupid man-and-woman-in-an-almost-romance scenario- it's just stunningly similar. I did like \\"DaVinci Code\\" (hated movie) because it was new, different. And I had heard this one was good. Wow- major disappointment.
B0002BO05S|5.0|This is a great movie depicting Jesus spreading the gospel, traveling with the apostles and ending with the cruxifiction and ressurection. For a movie that is over 3 hours, I think it flows well.  With many movies like this made during this era (1950-1970), The movie features great actors (Like Charlton Heston as John the Baptist), Fantastic visuals (The landscape shots are breathtaking) and costumes, this movie is a classy rendition of the Life and Death of Christ.
2743614811|5.0|I read about one book a week. Other than classics (Dickens, etc.) the content of the book may become vague to me after a month or so. After a year, I may even have forgotten that I read the book. I read \\"Shutter Island\\" 4 months ago- it hasn't left me for a day. Wow, what a book- soooo (hate the extra o's but no other way to phrase this) soooo well-written. Lehane is amazing with dialogue, character. The plot is honestly great- suspenseful, a mystery, a thriller- and all of this set at a hospital for the criminally insane, on an island and during a huge storm. Major atmosphere. And the fact that on top of this Lehane is a terrific writer- well, just BUY it. NOW.

0439023483|5.0|The Hunger games Book Review                                   Julia Carter  Katniss Everdeen, a sixteen year old girl, saves her sister; Prim Everdeen, from being put with a bunch of other teenagers in an arena to fight to death. The teenagers are from ages twelve to eighteen. Katniss volunteers to take her place. The other tribute is Peeta Mallark who has had a huge crush on her ever since he laid eyes on her. When she finds this out though, they are being broadcasted over live television all over the country Panem during Peeta's interview. Panem Is a country split into thirteen districts. It is where North America is today. Sometimes I wonder if North America evolved into a country called Panem or the people just decided to call the land Panem and everyone agreed. I loved the book Hunger Games so much! Most of the way throughout the book I was itching to read more. The book is very suspenseful in some parts. One of the things I loved the most was how well Suzanne Collins described Katniss's dresses made by Cinna. Cinna is her designer. The way Suzanne described them gave me a perfect picture of what Katniss looked like in the dresses. I liked how the book had a lot of details in the story. I could follow the story all of the way through with a good idea of what each of the situations would look like in pictures. The book is visual. One of my favorite parts in the book was when Rue died. Rue died by being captured in a net and speared in the stomach by a boy from district one when Katniss arrived to help her. It was an emotional part in the book. I was very sad! I loved Rue. My favorite character in the book was Katniss because she was the easiest to relate to, like sort of feel how she feels about different things in the story. For example, in the story she doesn't think the capital is right to put young adults in an arena to fight to death and I was thinking the same thing, but I do think it was right to build a story around that because that makes up most of the excitement. Another time we thought alike during the story was when Rue died, she was crying and I was sad as well. I thought it was great to hear that two tributes were able to win as long as they were alive and from the same district. I loved how Peeta and Katniss were able to meet up and beet Cato and Thresh. In my opinion the parade where all of the tributes were in their first costumes in the chariots riding through the crowd of people was very exciting. I liked Katniss's \\"girl on fire\\" dress was interesting. I think the fact that Cinna lit her cape on fire is what made it interesting. The one with crystals must have been pretty too. The yellow one at the end might have been beautiful as well but I don't think I would like it as much as the others if I were to see them. One thing I didn't like about the Hunger Games was the names. They were strange for example Katniss could have been Katy or Katelin. Peeta could have Peter or something like that but the names that were chosen were strange. Cato and Thresh were weird names too. Glimmer is a pretty name, but why was she called Glimmer? Some of them just don't make sense to me. Another thing I didn't understand was why are the Hunger Games called the Hunger Games? A strange part in the story was the part with the Tracker Jackers. Another part I didn't understand was when Suzanne mentioned Rue watching Peeta and Katniss train in the training center. We never did find out why she was watching them. Other than that, though, I thought the book was excellent. The Hunger Games is one of my favorite books!
B000VNMMQQ|5.0|Now, this is a *very* unrealistic movie, don't you think?<br /><br />Bruce Willis is back (fully clothed this time), and yes, he is impossible to kill. Neither choppers nor fighter planes can take him out. As usual, his adversaries are some kind of German-Russian terrorists. Naturally, a stereotyped nerdie hacker is part of the show, too.<br /><br />The top bandits lack personality, however. No scarred faces, no foreign accents, very little sociopathology, etc. The Asiatic woman looks like a stale computer animation. A hacker job, perhaps?<br /><br />This is a fan movie. If you actually liked \\"Die Hard\\", where Bruce was running around half-naked in a skyscraper for most of the time, or \\"Die Hard 2\\", with that fabulous plane crash, or \\"Die Hard and Zeus meets Simon Says\\" when you were 14 years old, you will *love* this one.<br /><br />If not, you will just say what me and my father said when we watched it the other day on Swedish cabel: \\"Now, this is a *very* unrealistic movie, don't you think?\\".<br /><br />:D<br /><br />Where's that fire sale, by the way?

0385504225|3.0|Entertaining about sums up the feeling I have when thinking of the novel the Lost Symbol. Robert Langdon returns in Dan Brown's newest thriller with plot twists and turns worthy of his last efforts but somewhat over the top and sophmoric in nature.  A great writer, Dan Brown, is not.  What Dan Brown delivers is an intersting plot with short one to two page chapters that will keep you turning to find out what happens.  The current drama involves the Freemasons and takes place in Washington D.C. which makes the story that much more relevant and current.  Interesting facts about the mysterious Masons and lost secret mystery schools will keep readers enthralled and reading to the end.  For me this book was about 200 pages too long...as with Angels and Demons it should have ended midway through and would have had a much greater impact.  At one point I remember thinking \\"C'mon already!\\"  Kudo's to Mr. Brown for his research and one particularly great plot twist that I never saw coming but as far as literay skills go, he remains entertaining at best.

0525951113|1.0|Fair warning:  this was such a bad book that I only made about 2/3rds of the way through it.  The fact that it currently has 4 stars on Amazon makes me think the review system is nearly worthless and I have to write this review in the hopes that it helps someone avoid wasting their money.    The first thirty pages are entertaining, the second thirty will leave you thinking \\"wait, that doesn't quite make sense\\" and the rest will leave you a little disturbed that you're wasting time reading it.     For example, at one point, we're supposed to believe that a computer program scans the newspaper headlines, sees news about a fired reporter, finds her cell phone number and personal data somehow, then calls her and convinces her to go to a hotel room where she can photograph a cop across the street cheating on his wife.  And, honestly, that's one of the more believable premises in the book.  Apparently, the evil villain created an AI that has access to every database in the world, understands human psychology completely and can predict the future nearly 100% accurately - meanwhile, our government is filled with idiots who are only good at keeping everything secret.    If you don't mind huge plot holes and just want a fast-paced read that you don't want to think about, this might fit the bill.  If you need even a little plot consistency or believability, stay far, far away.
B001UW58WW|5.0|I was going to eat out on my birthday, courtesy of some other lady friends, when we found that two of us couldn't come.  So I thought I would just watch public television.

B002GU5V24|4.0|It was good to put a lot of this material together into one box, but I was hoping for more extras.  For example, some more of the much-shunned Calling All Stations 1997 tour.  Surely there are some soundboard quality performances out there of this material.    However, it was good to get the \\"The Way We Walk\\" Volumes 1 & 2 on CD (finally).  If you wanted to upgrade some of your Genesis CDs then this is for you, but if you are hoping for some serious bonus tracks like the other boxed sets, you will be disappointed.

B002JIOQCO|2.0|After hearing Wolf Mothers's new album i was disappointed. I saw them live in Portland 2006 and loved them reminded me of old classic rock that didn't suck. Now their new album has no direction nothing blends together like their first self titled album did, the songs aren't as catchy or as well thought out. The riffs aren't the same or as great this album felt forced it dosn't have the old fun wold mother sound to it. It sounds too dark like they tried to pull a \\"Queens of the Stone Age\\" but tragicly failed. I only found 3 of the songs to be listenable and somewhat less boring than the rest over all its a great album; this album falls short of their 2006 accomplishment.

B001DSNELA|4.0|Batman Begins was the movie that started the whole franchise reboot craze. Like The Pink Panther, James Bond was soon to follow. Daniel Craig is good but in my opinion he lacks the suave sophistication that Connery, Moore and Brosnan had. He's a fine actor though, able to handle the action (especially Le Chiffre's torture), dramatic and romance scenes. Eva Green was a brilliant choice as Vesper. Unlike previous Bond girls where they had to be a government agent or nuclear physicist in order to be an equal with Bond, Vesper is able to make jabs at Bond and hold her own against his sexist ways but her character is not action oriented and emotionally vulnerable, which makes her more feminine than some of her predecessors. The shower and final scenes are the best examples I can give on how, other than Tracy from OHMSS, Vesper is the only woman Bond has ever fallen in love with. Le Chiffre, while not one of the more memorable villains in the Bond canon, is big step up from the bratty Gustav Graves. He is cold, calculating and not afraid to cut Bond down to size if he doesn't tell him what he wants to know. Judi Dench, the only connection to the previous films, returns as M, who is shown more in this film but some of her scenes just seem unnecesary to the storyline. The plot is good, though the only parts that are adapted from the original novel are the casino and torture scenes. I do hate that they made it seem that Le Chiffre had a hand in 9/11. In this and the following Bond film, I hate how they're striving too hard for realism, in the past, the politcal points of the films were always subtle (the Cold War, detante and the fall of Communnism) and sometimes actually relevant to the story. The reference to 9/11, to me anyways, just seemed pointless as it adds nothing to Le Chiffre's character or the plot. There are too many action sequences in this film, which hurts it a little bit. They make Bond seem like Superman, jumping around on top of construction sites and bursting through walls (I could hear the George Reeves Superman theme in my head when he did that). And the way Bond heals from all of his wounds is so astounding, he'd put Wolverine to shame. David Arnold provides probably his best Bond score, though his music, especially for the action sequences, are loud and obnoxious. And I know that this is Bond's first mission, but that doesn't mean he should just barely use the Bond Theme. I think it was Arnold himself on a special feature on the Bond music who said \\"Don't be afraid to use the Bond Theme. If it's not in the film, its just a regular action film.\\" Or something of that nature anyway (and I hope they stop making the Bond films look and feel like a regular action film. The Bonds have always been different from the rest and the direction the producers are going in are practically disgracing Broccoli's hard work). Chris Cornell, the first male singer on a Bond song since The Living Daylights, provides an excellent title song.ing through walls (I could hear the George Reeves Superman theme in my head when he did that).

0525421033|4.0|It is always difficult for me to write reviews for books that do not have any flaws in my opinion. \\"If I Stay\\" is one of those books. This story of love and family, of choices and happiness, is just so superbly written I am a little lost for words.<br /><br />I think the genius of this book is in the realness of the characters and emotions they experience. Not even once do you feel that you are manipulated into feeling what you feel. The story, while tragic, never crosses over into melodramatic or sappy.<br /><br />Another aspect of the book that I enjoyed (to my surprise actually) was music. I am not really a musical person, but music is an extremely important player in this book. It brings people together, it changes people's lives, it makes you want to continue living when you think you can't go on. In that respect this book reminded me a little of a movie \\"August Rush\\" that I also enjoyed to my surprise.<br /><br />Gayle Forman definitely earned my respect with this book. I don't know if she will be able to duplicate this success, but I am curious to check out her other books.
B0029O08WA|5.0|My 14 year old daughter can't stop listening to this. Plenty of hooks that get stuck in your head.
0385341008|5.0|Don't give up on this book.  When I started it I thought, \\"Where exactly is this going?\\"I kept on reading and I am happy I did so.  It is a wonderful book about a war that has children transported to another area in order to be safe.  I had an English friend who was one of those children transported to a safe place outside of London.  I wish she were here to enjoy this story.
0061854549|5.0|I actually heard about Mr. Ariely from iTunes when I finally converter from non-iPod user to iPod user last year. I have always been fascinated with finances and investing. I also like to think about how people feel and think in everyday life. Those two things have come together and have become a masterpiece of work. Dan Ariely you are a great person. I have always wanted to read your book and finally got the chance to...and when I actually read a book that is not required reading, you KNOW that book is AMAZING.<br /><br />The book has taught me some new things in life that I was try to spread among my friends and family.
0385504225|5.0|I am not sure why so many people that dislike Dan Brown's earlier books would read this one.  I for one absolutely love Dan Brown's books -- all of them.  This latest novel is his best yet.  From the first page, I was hooked and had difficulty putting it down.  I appreciate that he can pause to educate the reader while never slowing the action or intensity of the plot.  He doesn't waste time on irrelevant details and is a master at creating interest and tension to keep the reader engaged.  If you don't like Dan Brown, my guess is you won't like this book.  But if you enjoy his books as much as I have, you will not be disappointed.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|This gamepad is really impressive, my only concern is due to actual disabling to the entire Logitech G series in games like  Aion, gpotato games, etc. -witch are online games with GameGuard in Windows SO. Logitech must go to a deal with the Nguard software company in order to solve this. Take this how an advice before buying any Logitech G series.
B001BWQVUO|5.0|For those of you who have not yet \\"met\\" Gustavo Dudamel, this is an ideal introduction. The Music System of which he was apart in his home country of Venezuela, is an inspiration for every city who values their youths.
B000PFUAO6|4.0|I finally got around to listening to this and I have to say that I like it! This is extremely progressive and intense. I like all the songs but sometimes they go too far and might benefit from editing. Overall, I think LaBrie does a great job on vocals.
B002IR3PSC|3.0|I am a die hard Tull fan, and I am indeed going to buy this.  But once again why does the video editor  have to take speed before he started to edit video??  It is like he isn't showing his value if he is not  blending camera images, and switching cameras at 1 ever 3 seconds!  God, I hate that!!    It really degrades the performance because all we really want is to \\"Feel like we are there\\", but  give us a \\"Good seat\\", know the damn music so you know when to switch to lead guitar, drums, Tull.    It seems like the editor is some jackass from Cablevision that did the mixing because CV owns MSG??  This would make him the same dude that does camera coverage for the hockey games.  OK, yes, there  you are switching angles every 3 500 milliseconds, but not for a concert.    Great concert. Normally when the video editing is this bad I pass.  But when it is one of my Fav's  I have to live with it.  I wouldn't hire this editor to edit my kids sweet 16 video.  Jackass!  Took off two stars based on the unprofessional video editing, otherwise it would have been 5 stars.  Video Techs really are the scum of the music industry.
B001AQTWF2|2.0|so I gave it 2 stars.  I like Whitney Houston - always have; but, this just doesn't come close to sounding like the Whitney of old.  The songs are shorter and she really can't belt them out like she used to!  We all get older, we all change, but except for \\"I Look to You\\" I would not have purchased this one.  It's probably time for me to invest in an MP3 player - for albums such as this.  I hope she can improve over time.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|The Sopranos is gone, maybe forever, but Sons of Anarchy has taken its place with a killer first season featuring humour, action, romance, drama and simply brilliant story-telling.<br /><br />The whole premise of the series is the bikie gang Sons of Anarchy. They are run by Clay who is the partner of Gemma who is the mother of the vice-president of the club, Jax.<br /><br />Jax is the main star of the show and we get to see him torn between what the original intentions of the gang was (his dead father was the original leader) and what the club has become.<br /><br />I found the series to be brilliant, really enjoyed the characters and stroylines. The female ATF character is something to behold in her forcefulness.<br /><br />Looking forward to the second season.

0131103628|4.0|Before I jump into the review of the \\"C programming language\\" by the creators themselves, Yes K& R. Here are a few pointers you might find useful:    1. C is not a \\"Beginners Language\\". Talk to any person in India and they would say C is the easiest, then comes C++ and finally Java is the toughest language. Nothing is farther away from the truth.    To describe the difference, imagine you are building a machine. C is basically a collection of nuts and bolts. C++ is a collection of nuts and bolts + (Templates) or tools like Spanner, screwdriver etc and Java has NO nuts and bolts(no Pointers) and only Tools in it.  So it should be obvious to anyone that C is the toughest of the lot since you first have to build the Tools(meaning write your own libraries and functions) and then build the machine.    2. Anyone who claims that he can directly jump into C++ and Java by ignoring C in my thoughts would not be a good programmer. C is the basic building block of both C++ and Java so mastering C means that you have already understood the structure of C++/Java and all you need now is to understand using the Tools(Templates) and knowledge of Object Oriented language.    Now about the BOOK, K & R C    1. This book is not for Dummies or beginners. You need mastery of Assembly language and/or mastery of mathematics and logic to solve the problem in the exercices by yourself.  If you can solve the exercises by yourself then you can claim to be proficient in the C language.    2. This book is for the UNIX/Linux audience. If you are not working on either of these or if you are from Microsoft background, then you can look for some other book.    In short, If you want to learn C the best way and learn it fully, This is the  best C programming book no doubt about it.
B0029O08WA|5.0|I LOVE this soundtrack! Every song on here is great. :) Definitely buy this CD.
B00000JQFL|5.0|EWF is a great band. This is a memorable live cd that all EWF fans should own.
B002MRROKS|5.0|If you like Nirvana, then you must own this. On DVD, vinyl, CD, or all three. The DVD of course is the most essential component of this release. You simply have to see this performance. They absolutely tear through their hits and their back catalog, including the brilliant cover of \\"The Money Will Roll Right In\\" by Fang. Nirvana were the best in the business.   Make sure you do better than your TV speakers when you do play this. And make sure no one is trying to sleep in the house.
B002MW50KO|5.0|I ordered Christmas in the Heart not expecting much. I simply wanted to be a part of what Dylan had in mind recording this CD, hoping that by buying it I will be a part of greater good. But when it was delivered and I heard it - well, it's another amazing Dylan and this will be for me an amazing and totaly different Christmas.
B002GY9F9K|4.0|This series was a fun fantasy/adventure. The different places they had to go to and the people they had to fight made this well worth the viewing. Just found out they are having another series of Legend of the Seeker this year.Can't wait to see what happens to them this time. Good clean family fun.
B002VECMA4|5.0|I came to see this movie for the previews with George Clooney and was not dissapointed and Jeff Bridges was just as good. It may not have constant laughs like Caddyshack but it is still a funny movie. Howard the Duck was not a well rated movie when it came out either but is now considered buy some to be a classic so maybe Men who stare at goats will be also someday.
0385532458|4.0|In Pat Conroy's Amazon review of Ford County: Stories, he says that a writer enters a ring of fire when he enters the short-story arena. However, since Grisham is usually very readable, I decided to give Ford County: Stories a try. In the Amazon video, Grisham explained the publication of these stories by saying he had  \\"stories that pop up that are not quite long enough to be novels.\\" I think that's what bothered me. They seemed incomplete.  Some seemed like the first chapter in a story. I kept waiting for something more to happen. That's not to say that I didn't enjoy what was there; I just wished there was more.     I could see some of the stories mirrored in my own Southern county. My favorite was the very first story, Blood Drive--good ol' boys trying to do a good deed and getting sidetracked by all the evils of the big city, the funniest of the seven stories.  A couple of stories, Casino and Quiet Haven, had unexpected twists. The most poignant was Funny Boy. All in all, I wanted these stories to be a bit more--moving, funny, sad, or something. Although they were pleasant, they are not stories I would reread. For that, I always go back to John Chancellor Makes Me Cry by Ann Rivers Siddons and Truman Capote's The Thanksgiving Gift and A Christmas Memory.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Fantastic reboot of a great series. The  bonus features are WELL worth it. It is fun to see the extras that JJ Abrams included. This is what happens when a Sci-Fi fan makes a movie. =-)
0312370849|3.0|Overall, I enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it.  I didn't know about the roundup and appreciate the history in the book.  I agree with another reader who said that Sarah's point of view ended too abruptly.  The beginning of the book was engrossing and the end fell short.  We should have followed Sarah all the way to the states.  As a side note, I was a little offended at how the author bashed Americans so often throughout the book.  Did she have a hidden agenda or was I reading into it?
B000URX1DG|5.0|I've been recommending Elliott Smith for years to all my dearest friends, whenever there is a chance to hang out, have a smoke and a few drinks and play our favourite music to each other I inevitable reach for ES.  Strangely after years of trying nobody seems to have taken him up.  I don't get it.  For me, and I abhor the frivolous use of the term genius in modern soceity, he is genuine genius material comparable to Mozart or anyone else you care to mention (e.g. the subtle vibrato guitar in the right channel at 2:08 on Cupids trick) .  Truly gifted.  I'm glad I got to see him live on his Figure 8 tour but to those who have supported him before his mainstream(ish) success I applaud you for recognising a true talent before the rest of us caught on.  Since his death I can only appreciate him more.  I have also learnt more about guitar playing from him than anyone else.  For anyone interested in listening to some unrleased output check out the Basement II demos (search it), it has some amazing recordings - even the demos that didn't make albums are better than most mere mortals can muster.
B00006D295|5.0|absolutely adore this film, it's so mad, glitzy, camp and crazy that I never tire of it. Granted it's not for everyone, and you need a sense of humour and fun to fully appreciate it, but one you get into it, it's just perfect. The songs are timeless, the cast is sublime and the whole film is in a class of it's own. One thing I do love is the way the film doesn't take itself too seriously, it sends up all those cheesy science fiction films and musicals of the past and never stops for breath. Of course, the film's main draw is the outstanding Tim Curry as Frank-N-Furter. His performance is dazzling and I doubt he'll ever be able to top this. Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick are excellent in thankless roles, and the rest of the supporting cast (Patricia Quinn and Little Nell especially) are all perfect in their different and crazy roles. It's always puzzled me how the film hasn't managed to date, it still looks and sounds as fresh as ever. I'm sure I'm not the only one surprised by the ending too! Rocky Horror is perfect for a fun and sultry night in, so whip out your fishnets and do the timewarp. Go on, you know you want to, your not fooling anyone!

B002S0OBFK|1.0|You have to be kidding me !!<br />This movie MUST really be a study in marketing and \\"bandwagon\\" thinking.<br /><br />This movie is not bad because of a low $10,000 budget.<br />It is bad because ....... well, it's simply flat, lame, boring, silly and bad.<br /><br />Having heard so much hype about this movie, four (4) friend and I went to see this movie.  We thought from what we had heard, that perhaps on a low budget somebody had managed to create a real classic in terror that would get into your psyche and make you think.<br /><br />When we walked out of the theater we were all looking at each other with a \\"You have to be kidding me\\" look on our faces.<br /><br />We felt like we had been ripped off by some marketing scam.<br /><br />Anybody and I mean ANYBODY over the age of six (6) years old who claims this movie was spooky or scared them in the least DESERVES to be made fun of !<br /><br />This was simply lame, boring and bad.<br /><br />We can't believe the reaction we heard about this movie is genuine.<br /><br />This film MUST be part of some psychology research experiment to test marketing and advertising methods.<br /><br />Do not believe anything you have heard about this movie being chilling or scary.<br /><br />Trust me .... walking out to your parked car in a New York City parking lot after dark is more scary than this movie.<br /><br />Seriously !
B001KVZ6FW|2.0|This film was not very good.  It had some decent comedic moments that were given away in the previews and a lot of emotional scenes that children watching this film will not understand or care for.  To depressing and other than the bird all decent scenes were shown in the previews, the rest is filler.
B002MJV7JA|4.0|A guilty pleasure show to watch on E!.  Aired spring of 2008.  Season 2.  Well, we get more episodes in the 2cd season.  The 1 that will tug at the heart strings is the last episode when they go to New Orleans & help a family out who lost their home in the 2005 Katrina storm.    No special extras.  A few deleted scenes & a video segment with Rob.    Now, here are the problems with it 1.  EPISODES ARE NOT UNCUT.  Come on.  The Girls Next Door DVD's are uncut they have nudity & language.  Why is this show NOT shown uncut?  I am very disappointed in that. 2.  This HORRIBLE & CHEAP DVD case/holder.  It has intentional HOLES IN IT ON BOTH FRONT & BACK  Cheap, stupid & THOUGHTLESS 3.  No commentary as well on the episodes      At lease it does have a chapter/episode list.  BUT, the 1st season DVD said the original air dates for the episodes  Season 2 does NOT    Let us hope the DVD for season 3 is better than this
B0000696ID|5.0|This is Steven Speibergs best movie ever. this movie is truly a classic among classics. i really can't say anything more than that this movie is awesome. i enjoyed it a lot and i hope you will to. I Recommend it for everyone
B001V9LRV0|5.0|They finely included CCR in this package,but they did not cut them into movie.They are on an extra disc entitled Woodstock:Untold Stories.This disc also includes some great never before seen performances by Santana,Canned Heat,Mountain,Johnny Winter and Paul Butterfield.No Blood Sweat And Tears.    For me it was worth buying this set for the Untold Stories Disc,although they did not bother using all the camera shots to make it wide-screen as the movie was done.

B001AKTZPA|3.0|I enjoyed the 2 instrumentals *Broken Spoke Shuffle and * Glory Be from the extra tracks,they fit well.The live extras were 3 man band CCR and not that great.It is a shame they could not have found a few rare live 4 man band CCR tracks to include.      As far as the sound of this remasterd CD It does not compare to the 24K gold Green River remasterd disc.
0375413405|5.0|I bought this book after seeing all the lovely food in the J & J movie. At first I was apprehensive about attempting anything, having never cooked before, ever(heating up pasta sauce in the micro-wave doesn't really count). So I tried the very first recipe, potato and leek soup(which sounded yuck), but was actually delicious and not really difficult at all. The directions were precise, which is great. I managed to cut the leeks in the wrong direction(but I would not have known unless mum told me so). I can't wait until I get to the poultry and dessert sections.
0385341008|2.0|I'm a law student who was hungry for a good novel, and followed the recommendations, which are glowingly complimentary. Perhaps in the future I should take this as a signal that the work in question is a book to avoid. The note on the cover from Elizabeth Gilbert saying I simply MUST read this should also have been a clue (I found Eat Pray Love to be grotesquely self-indulgent and gave up on it when her blue soul and her ex-husbands flew around in the air in India forgiving each other).<br /><br />Long and short is that I just began part two and I really don't care anymore. Contrived, dishonest, sickeningly sweet, and cliche (complete with annoying old schoolmarm type whose come-uppance we are clearly meant to relish). The \\"letter format\\" gimmick was intriguing at first but became annoying and hard to follow; it also is a significant barrier to real literary tension and plot development (I defy anyone to tell me in one coherent sentence what is the central conflict of this novel). So many people in first person and it's hard to keep them separate (and frankly when I want a delicious and thoughtful escape I don't want to have to work hard to keep up with who's who). I cannot help but feel that I am being manipulated a bit, with random images of horror interspersed among giddy, light, happy letters. I wouldn't suggest a gloomy novel, but what a wonderful subject and potential for real human drama. This is Hallmark Card drama, not Kite Runner drama, or Handmaid's Tale drama. I am officially giving up on this book, which is not easy to do. I read through the reviews hoping someone would say it just drags through the middle but WHAT AN ENDING! Nowhere in sight and my reading-for-pleasure time is strictly limited and I cannot afford to keep the commitment I usually make upon opening a book and reading the first 10 pages.<br /><br />Too bad. It's almost good, just not quite.<br /><br />If you're looking, a much better novel with alternating first-person narratives in a unique setting is The Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsovler.nwood Bible by Barbara Kingsovler.
0307454541|5.0|This is the first time I've been compelled to write a review.  I'm not into writing book reports so, I don't intend to do that here.  I just want to say that I found the book fully satisfying.  I will say that it took about 75 to 100 pages before I found myself absorbed which just increased as I read on.<br /><br />I love the character Lisbeth Salander, she is very intriguing and I look forward to reading \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" to learn more about her.<br /><br />The novel is a bit long, I will say that, but in the end I was sad there wasn't more to read!<br /><br />I love how this novel had more than one story going on too!  Overall the book is well written, thought out and keeps you thinking.  Excellent mystery/crime novel.  The 2nd in the series is soon on it's way to me!
B001W6S0C6|3.0|The Blu-Ray is great.. but isn't this suppose to come with a Digital Copy?  If so.. I don't have it with the copy I bought from Amazon.
0385333846|3.0|While Slaughterhouse Five has a very engaging plotline, an interesting writing style, and a host of creative characters, the story noticeably runs out of steam about half of the way through. I hold Kurt Vonnegut in high regard, and have thoroughly enjoyed many of his other works, such as Welcome to the Monkey House and Man Without a Country, but this book just didn't impress me. The author's occasional unexplained shift of venue to a moment totally unrelated was a major annoyance to me. The first half, however, is an enjoyable read. I would recommend borrowing the book from the library rather than paying money for it, but others might find it more engaging than I did.
B001U7FW1O|5.0|All of the dramatic intensity, poetry, and romance that defines Ultravox is remastered and presented without a flaw in this collection.  A must for any true Ultravox fan that would like to be reminded of the days when there really was alternative music that had passion.  Ultravox was one of those bands back then (along with many others) that simply set the standard so high...most of the homoginized disposable trash (i mean, recording artists) of today are weak in comparison.  This collection was launched along side of a U-VOX reunion tour...unfortunately, the U.S. is not a stop on the tour!!!  Fans in the U.S. will be happy that the DVD in the collection is NTSC format (not PAL as advertised).  Some of the best highlights on the DVD are the live cuts and rare bits of footage from the early days, and let's not forget the vintage videos by the \\"godfather of music videos\\" Russel Mulcahy.  A nice collection that reflects the finest era of all the Ultravox years...the Midge Ure years 1981-1986.
0307346617|5.0|It's about zombies, but could be about any plague striking worldwide, such as H1N1.   It's really about how people deal with an unimaginable pandemic. Not the best book I've read, but 4 and a half stars.  I gave it 5 though.
0740785508|5.0|Imaginative Realism is a guide deep into the world of painting surreal characters being taught by a renowned artist. Before going much further it is important to note this book is not a \\"how-to\\" guide or tutorial book, it is more on the specifics of why you do something. You can go to any bookstore or search on Amazon for a slew of \\"how-to\\" books about digital and traditional painting, but will find very little on the specifics.<br /><br />Sometimes its a good idea to know why you do something as it lets you expand on the concept, even if you take it in a new direction. The things I learned from this book have been both inspiration and process, which I am now using in my own work. I have found much of whats contained within this books pages is information most people go to art school for. Now I am not saying its a complete substitute, but if you (like me) didn't attend school you will be sure to pick up priceless techniques and processes.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book even if you aren't into sci-fi art/fantasy art. The processes alone make this book a 5-star!
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Buy it.  but only if you like AIC music.  Great guitar, both acoustic and electric.  Great vocals.

0307269981|3.0|I am a reader who does not like intense and graphic violence.  Yet, I thoroughly enjoyed the first book in this series, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. The author has created characters and relationships that I deeply responded to and cared about. That is why I was eager to read the second book, The Girl Who Played with Fire, which continues with the same fascinating cast of characters along with the violence.  It also illuminates more of the background information about their lives in surprising and believable ways.  However, the resolution at the end included some plot elements that were ridiculous and so incredible as to destroy much of the momentum and enjoyment of the story. I would give the ending one star, but had to rate the whole book as 3 stars because I can't say that I didn't like it. In fact, I will read the next book. Still, prepare to be disappointed at the end.

B000X1Z0BU|4.0|When Two Worlds Collide-Updated October 2013<br /><br />Everybody, everybody who lives in cities, or who takes public transportation to the city has seen some straggly, snarling, struggling guy playing guitar, playing it well or poorly but playing it to rise above the din of city noises, and singing. Singing covers of some popular tunes, some tunes which will get we damn busy heads down travelers already late for something to listen up for a minute. Singing and strumming, well or poorly, but always with an open guitar case in for the \\"thank you kindly\\" donation that allows him to survive, to breathe, to write his lonely ballads, and to keep the wolves (read: landlord and other bill collectors) from his door. What you probably didn't know, unless of course you are among the seven people in the world who still listens to and supports folk music, roots music, street music or whatever you want to call it,  that those nameless guys (and gals) have stories to tell. Have the usual array of problems and dreams like the rest of us.<br /><br />Problems like love, marriage, kids, lost ones, and dreams of making it off the streets and into the music studios and then... That back story, both the problems and the dream parts, are what drives this film under review, Once, about the connection, for a moment in time as it turned out, between a guy street musician in Dublin (that`s in Ireland for the heathens and an immigrant girl wannabe musician (immigrant in the days when, for a minute, Ireland stopped being a place to get bloody well out of going across the sea to Liverpool or across the pond to Amerikee and was a place to go to for dreams).<br /><br />Under normal circumstance such a boy meets girl saga, would seemingly pose no problems for them getting together. There would almost have to be (and was) a natural attraction. But that is where the back story gets complicated, complicated just like for the rest of us. First off the guy was still pining away for his muse-girlfriend(Irish) who betrayed him with another lover and who was off in London. Secondly the girl, a Czech national, was married, married with a child, a little girl, (and with a mother in tow) whose estranged husband is back in the Czech Republic. What draws them together is the love of music. His rough-hewn plainsongs of sorrow and lost and her more delicate wistful attempts to make sense of a world through song (and piano) that is kind of passing her by.<br /><br />But to the music, the all- consuming music that is really the star of this film since a great deal of its time is spent with the pair alternately flirting and creating something like a demo CD to shop around in order to get their big break, the one that will right their lives. That music, which by the way was written and sung by the actors who played the boy and girl (Glen Hansard and  Marketa Irglova), gets a lot of work-out here as he or she will burst into song at command. But in the end the two worlds, the world of the muse-driven (and career-driven as well) Irishman and a young immigrant woman looking for a father for her daughter as well as the music just couldn't mix, couldn't stand the huge effort to put those two worlds together. Couldn't stand the collision. As so they went their separate ways.  How is that for a back story of that straggly, snarling, struggling guy you see at that subway stop every workday morning.<br /><br />Original Review<br /><br />This is a quirky film. No question. It provides a very interesting twist in today's international multi-cultural society on the standard boy meets girl theme, and in Dublin no less. It also provides a quirky look at a subject that has always interested me, the trials and tribulations of trying to make ends meet while one is waiting to get one's big chance on the musical scene.<br /><br />As for the boy (Glen Hansard) meets girl (Marketa Irglova)part the two, a strong but sensitive Irish lad trying to go from busker (street singer) to the limelight anda displaced Czech gal (with child and mother in tow) trying to make it on her own in up and coming modern day \\"Irish Tiger\\" (at least up until the last couple of years) Dublin. The glue that puts them together?  Well, she just happens to be something of a muse- and apparently classically- trained at that. This one and one half hour film centers on that musical collaboration, the possible budding romance between the two, the baggage and drag of their previous lives and something of a surprise at the end. All the while they are making beautiful music together, really just the music folks (for the most part, although some of his singing is a little over the edge for my tastes). What no over-the top, no gratuitous violence to save a fair damsel in distress, no ironic detachment under the stress of modern living?  No. I told you this was a quirky movie.

0307270807|5.0|I'm a Vietnam veteran myself, merely from the toxic fringes of that conflict, but I still got the taste of it, the total murderous irrationality, like the whole thing was happening on another planet. It derailed my life almost completely, because my nose was forcibly rubbed in the hypocrisy and violence behind the rah-rah, George Washington and the cherry tree type of history that I'd been taught in school. Naturally some people will hate this book because they can't stand its challenge to the most basic assumptions of their lives. However, in war, you have to function in a totally different world where even the most bedrock values of patriotism and friendship are twisted into a devil's brew that can poison your soul.    When you try to remain a human being instead of an animal in wars like Vietnam and Afghanistan, the effort can break you. And then you have to come back home again and function in a reasonably civilized society where you aren't supposed to solve your problems by shooting guns at other people. Life becomes a hallucination where all values are questionable and there's no ground under your feet. This book does a pretty good job of taking you inside the brains of soldiers who survived an experience of total barbarism.     Whether you like it or not, Vietnam is extremely relevant to the problems that our Afghanistan veterans are encountering today. How many homeless veterans are on the streets today? About 200,000. How is this possible? Read \\"Dispatches\\" and you'll see something of what these people went through, and why they can no longer function as good little boys and girls in our sheltered American society. Timid people in Illinois may develop heartburn from learning the price that we're paying for our casual foreign wars, the ruined lives, the human cannon fodder that we carelessly destroy, our so-called \\"heroes\\" that we actually treat like dogs in an animal shelter. Two cheers for democracy! Because we, meaning you and me, are the citizens who letthis kind of (----) happen.
6304779356|5.0|I grew up on this movie and no matter how corny it would be if it was made today, it still stands up as a fantastic movie: a classic!<br />The acting is still great, the storyline is great, and the comedy is still funny!
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|The irrascible Ed Asner is here to provide a narrative as outrageous as it is substantive. Kids, dogs and mean people abide, and all works out via seemingly insurmountable odds. I haven't read any other reviews, but so much is given that all can learn from. Great lessons for kids: old people are not all bad; some kids who don't fit in might have talents that will surprise you; all Labradors will love you, regardless. All of the above depends on how you're treated by those who care for you. A lovely film, lots of action, and lots of love. I enjoyed it very much.  Some DVD extras are good. \\"Dug's Special Mission\\" is just an outtake from the film, but an added animated short called \\"Partly Cloudy\\" was sweet, sentimental and enjoyable. An extension of the lesson of \\"Up\\"... with understanding, all things can be worked out.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I say fundamental because if you are growing up, you're undoubtedly facing many of today's peer pressure and negativity that Christina addresses on many tracks on this album. You may not agree with her image, but you cannot deny that several songs on this album such as \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"The Voice Within\\" are the kinds of messages you WANT your kids to listen to growing up. They possess such a strong message of the power of self-esteem and never letting anyone bring you down.<br />Thanks Christina.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|I avoided seeing this film for a long time because, in the late 70's, I was over-saturated with ABBA. Being somewhat of a film aficianado, I've come to believe that Meryl Streep is among the finest of actresses...ever. I had to check out her musical romp, and I wasn't disappointed. Everyone knows she has a great voice (Postcards from the Edge, Ironweed) and I'm surprised she hasn't been used in other musical endeavors. Regardless, I enjoyed \\"Mamma Mia!\\" a lot; a sweet love story centering around middle'aged types. How refreshing. I was entertained a lot, and if you weren't, maybe you should lighten up a bit. I enjoyed the entire cast of old pros, and also the lovely Amanda Seyfried as the catalyst of all the silliness that ensues. It's so silly, but I applaud the film for its unrelenting energy. Kick back, have popcorn and beverages of choice, and enjoy this attempt to bring back the exhuberant musical style that hasn't been successful since \\"Grease\\" (1978) or \\"Hair\\" (1979). Meryl Streep really shines, once again.
0743455967|5.0|I like Stephen King fine, but admit I'm not an on-fire, can't-wait-for-the-next-one fan. But I AM fascinated by how a practitioner learns to practice, and this is an excellent case study in that. From childhood roots (including a memory about 'treatment' for ear infections that surely colored his future)through substance abuse, to the exhilaration of the first big check, King provides a tour of how a learner learns. The book includes interesting details about his approach to the writing process -- I love that his characters emerge as he's writing them, sometimes surprising even him -- and some solid guidelines for aspiring writers. For those interested in reading about learning-in-practice/reflective practice, I also recommend Atul Gawande's \\"Complications\\".
B0000TG9E2|4.0|I threw all my packaging away- not an avid online shopper, and have found that the dvd has a warped spot that causes it to stop towards the end of the movie.

B000MG1ZGA|5.0|L.A. Woman (1971) was the last studio album by The Doors before singer Jim Morrison died in Paris, France on July 3rd.  This album sort of picks up where Morrison Hotel left off.  Morrison Hotel had some bluesy songs, and L.A. Woman has even more.  By the time this album was recorded, Jim Morrison had lost some of his ability to sing effectively.  This no doubt was related to heavy alcohol consumption, which affected his voice.  The irony is that his raspy and hoarse voice fits in well with this blues-like rock album.  This album was recorded almost entirely live.  In other words, each song had Ray Manzarek, Robbie Krieger, John Densmore, and Jim Morrison performing at the same time, rather than recording just the music first and then adding the vocals later.  this album was produced by Bruce Botnick, who replaced Paul Rothschild after Rothschild walked away from the early recording sessions.  Apparently Rothschild didn't like the material and wasn't turned on by it, even calling some of the material \\"cocktail music\\".<br /><br />The album begins with one of my favorite Doors songs ever, The Changeling, a good combination of hard rock and blues.  Morrison sings with a lot of intensity.  The classic Love Her Madly still gets plenty of airplay to this day.  I love the song Been Down So Long.  A real blues tune with blues lyrics to match.  A classic.  Cars Hiss By My Window is another classic - a slow beat, mellow, bluesy, and some of Morrison's best vocal sound effects near the end of the song.  He moans, but the moaning almost sounds like an electric guitar.  The super classic title track is next, and gets tons of radio play to this day.  This song is upbeat and a Top 40 type of tune, yet a little bit bluesy.  Perfect.  L'America is about a trip to Latin America.  Morrison teases the listener with some of his lyrics.  You might think he's about to cuss, but he doesn't.  Hyacinth House is an often overlooked and underrated song, in my opinion.  Ray Manzarek's organ playing is great.  Crawling King Snake, a song written by John Lee Hooker, is a great blues song with some killer guitar playing by Robbie Krieger.  The Wasp (Texas Radio and the Big Beat) is very unique, somewhat strange, but a great tune, bottom line.  The classic Riders On The Storm is the last track on the original release of this album.  Mellow, eerie, melodic, and great sound effects.  An all time classic.<br /><br />This CD also has two bonus tracks.  The first one is Orange County Suite, which also appears on The Doors Box Set.  This song is outstanding musically.  This song was basically a demo that never made it onto the original album.  It's another song that has an eerie sound to it.  The second bonus track is (You Need Meat) Don't Go No Further, which features Ray Manzarek on vocals.  This song originally was released on the 1972 \\"best of\\" compilation album called Weird Scenes Inside The Gold Mine, which I have.  Ray Manzarek sometimes filled in for Jim Morrison on vocals at concerts where Morrison was either late for the concert or had passed out from either alcohol or drugs.  Manzarek is an amazing musician who can play organ with his right hand, organ bass with his left hand, and sing (when needed) all at the same time.<br /><br />If you want to buy one of the great Doors albums and one of the great albums in rock 'n roll history, then L.A. Woman is your album and I highly recommend it.  This album has been remastered to sound better than ever.great.

B000EWD1KK|4.0|Though the movie is from a different generation, my freshmen liked comparing it to the short story. They especially enjoyed Danny Kaye's performance. They watched one scene repeatedly--impressed with his vocal talents.
B002M2N9JI|4.0|The first thing that comes to mind when one looks at the album cover is the resemblance between Elly Jackson's androgynous looks and early Eurythmics Annie Lennox, but beyond the superficial comparisons and the extense family tree attributed to the duo composed by Jackson and Ben Langmaid, La Roux is a tiny box of surprises.    There is no denying that the army of singles released before the record created a huge anticipation and even generated rumors of possibilities of failure, but they successfully sail through all that and deliver a cheerful debut record that is, well, irresistible. La Roux works well both as a collection of smashing singles and as a musical body.    The fact that the recording coincided with the end of her relationship might explain the overall tone of the album, but also gives an opportunity to explore lyrics and composition past the monotone / minimalistic synthesizer arrangements. When the book opens up one can savor melancholy (Fascination), deception (Growing pains) and hope (Bulletproof). This puts to rest the worries about contrived musical range and explains in part the popularity of the duo. It does not hurt either that they, along with a horde of emerging artists, cite as their direct influence the electro-pop acts of the 80's that we all so dearly love; but the trick is to stand out and is precisely where the issue may reside.    Ironically, for a record that screams from its four corners the desire to be taken seriously it finds its most inspired moments in the slow tracks. Cover my eyes and Tigerlily give a glimpse of what she can do without forcing that falsetto on us. The power of simplicity!    In the end it is hard to decide which direction La Roux would need to take to become a lasting impression. The choruses are contagious and the record is a singalong sensation sure to be reminded in every party for the rest of the year, but what about after? They are experiencing the moment and just like that they are entitled to enjoy being a pseudo spin-off from everything eighties. They prove they are good at following pressed paths but also effective at paving their own ground, even if shyly. \\"I'm going in for the kill, I'm doing it for the thrill\\" summons it all, and we are keeping our ears wide open for more.
B002KAJ0AO|5.0|Backstreet's back for sure - this CD is awesome!  I loved every song.  Always loved them, always will!
B002KLAL4W|4.0|Let's get something out of the way right away: this is not the Avocado album part. 2. If you are still stuck in the `90s and the long-haired image every \\"grunge\\" was associated with you will be sorely disappointed; not because this is a bad record, quite the contrary, but because it offers a smart return to shape making use of every element they have assimilated and fused throughout their eighteen years of career.    What differentiates Pearl Jam from any other middle-aged band struggling to stay alive is that they have learned from past mistakes. They no longer spit their frustration by sabotaging commercial exposure on the media (curiously, this is the first time they debut number 1 on the Billboard top 200 since 1995), and instead point their arrows to tighter arrangements, better lyrics and explosive, catchier singles.    Opening Gonna see my friend is a violent start that immediately puts them on top. There is a cadence in the album progression from loud rock to soft ballads and back to floor-trembling tunes, something their last record evidently lacked. The fixer might be the lead single but it does not resume properly the intentions nor the sound of Backspacer.     Vedder demonstrates that he can masterfully write and perform compelling ballads that step farther away from teen angst (circa Ten) and more in harmony with a mature band that is no longer afraid of following their own path and disengaging from the current deplorable state of music. Just breathe and Unthought known are clear examples of the universality of his music, displayed majestically in towering choruses destined to be sung like anthems beside Alive and Better man.    Having left the political stance temporarily on the night table does not mean they are back to looking inside. If Vedder's voice conveys the exasperation of observing life impassively moving forward in no direction, the double-edged team Gossard-Ament channels effectively the energy they exude from a fresh approach. True, some moments may reminisce of Vitalogy (Supersonic) or vaguely of No Code (Speed of Sound -no relation to that other song) but it only completes the chapter and rounds up their work as a unity.    Having survived the stamp of time with grace they have again made us blink with nervousness at the quality of their music. Not since Yield have I felt the need to play over a Pearl Jam CD because it was so enjoyable. Not since No code have I paid attention to the lyrics to decipher Eddie Vedder's mumbling. Not since Ten have they sounded so driven and so fun. This is arguably their best work to date. When Vedder concludes \\"My dear / the end / come near / I'm here / but not much longer\\" he leaves the door ajar with a morbid invitation to finish what we've started.

B00204AA0O|4.0|...And I'm referring to myself, as in I'm back to writing reviews. Anyway, I was pleased to hear Regina Spektor was performing on Saturday Night Live because I have been a fan of hers for years. And since I listened to and enjoyed her last album [[ASIN:B000FFJ80I Begin to Hope]], I didn't hesitate to pick up Far.<br /><br />If people still aren't familiar with Regina, I'll say two things: 1) I won't classify her music as anti-folk because I said a while ago that classifying something as \\"anti-\\" anything is pretty broad; and 2) her music is not to be taken lightly because as reviewer Courtney Murphy pointed out, the average listener might think the songs run into each other. The only real exception to this would probably be the opening track, \\"The Calculation\\" (which might be the best song).<br /><br />But there are plenty of nice songs on here, like \\"Man of a Thousand Faces\\", the introspective \\"Laughing With\\" and the bouncy \\"Eet\\". Speaking of bouncy, though, the second chorus of \\"Folding Chair\\" doesn't feel right; and the song that follows it, \\"Machine\\", really doesn't make any sense. And I'm used to Regina being a storyteller, but \\"Wallet\\" didn't hold my interest. Still, Far proves that great music isn't too far away, so pick it up.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert

B002K0WBXW|5.0|For those of us who watched and loved \\"While You Were Sleeping\\", this movie is a must see.  Bullock and Reynolds have the same great chemistry;  not to mention all the comedic moments they play off each other so well.  Betty White who seems to have started a second career as a \\"movie star\\" delivers her lines slick, smart and hilarious!!!
0316044938|4.0|This is a beautiful, thought provoking story.  The first few pages depict a young girl's brutal rape and murder, so this can be overwhelming for some readers.  As a mother, I found it hard to read, but the character stays \\"alive\\" since the story is told from her perspective in heaven.  It actually turns out to be very reassuring because she is still able to see and influence her loved ones.  The best part of this book for me was the author's imagined heaven, which made for an interesting conversation starter.  Great book club choice.
B00004VW5A|3.0|The music is timeless, of course, and this set delivers the goods. As historic as these performances are, you'd think there would be an information booklet included with the set, as there was with the 1992 set and, indeed, just about every CD set on the market. Nope! Keep that in mind when deciding which set to order, this more recent slipcase version or the older box. As far as I can tell from the reviews, the mastering and sonic quality are the same. Incidentally, used copies of the 1992 booklet are available on the Amazon site for extra $$.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|Colorful fairytale images traipsed across the screen in this adventure \\"peopled\\" with strange creatures and confusing happenings.<br /><br />It has been years since I've read the book, which is up next on my list, and I've never seen the film.  My grandson Noah watched it with me, and his giggles and exclamations told me how delightful this experience was for him.<br /><br />I am sure that the movie, like the book, is full of symbolism that certainly escaped me in my childhood, and which my grandson was not noticing, either.<br /><br />But in this moment, I felt like simply enjoying the playful creatures.  Instead of being upset by growing larger and smaller, or by the strange playing cards that danced, Alice was obviously living in the moment, simply exclaiming \\"Curiouser and curiouser.\\"<br /><br />Living in a world that defies the logic that we are accustomed to reminds me of the society in which we now live.  Perhaps this tale is a statement about our world and Alice's response to the events and creatures she encounters could be a lesson of sorts.  That adjusting and adapting are preferable to fighting against things over which we have no control.

I saw Disney's A Christmas Carol in 3D at my local IMAX theatre and was swept away both visually and emotionally by the film.  The animation is wonderful, the cast was wonderful and the music was wonderful... Andrea Bocelli did a song for this movie that was absolutely beautiful.<br /><br />I've always been partial to the 1930's version of A Christmas Carol but Disney's version is right on par with the earlier one.  The movie kept to it's classic roots and had just enough \\"Disney Essence\\" to make it fun and emotionally fulfilling.  Go see this... You won't be disappointed!
B000ESST6U|5.0|I won't add much to the accolades that are already available, but I will say that David McVicar's production repays close attention: not only is it entertaining and fun (always, I think, tastefully so), but it's clear from the performance that his rehearsal process allowed these fine singers to inhabit their roles better than many opera productions I've seen. After almost 4 hours, I found myself wanting to spend more time with these characters, to learn more about them. I rarely have that feeling after watching a Baroque opera.

0786868724|5.0|Mitch Albom has a way with words.  His current book is a wonderful book to read.  Albom tells the stories of two men of God one a Rabbi in New Jersey and the other a Pastor in Detroit.  It was a quick read and I honestly couldn't put the book down.      As a pastor who frequently is asked questions about faith, it was fascinating to see the conversations that Albom had with this two different men of faith.   He shares the conversations about life, death, God, and much more.  Albom reminds people that clergy are people as well as men of God.  He shares the Reb's humor and personality as he recalls the Reb singing during most conversations.  Albom shares the past of Henry the pastor who has done time and yet still thanks God for his life and his bleak situation.    The book chronicles 8 years of Albom's travels to New Jersey to develop a personal relationship with his childhood rabbi.  Over that time, Albom also develops a relationship with a pastor in Detroit who tries to help those down on their luck.  The book is easy to read as it includes snippets from sermons from years ago and stories that shaped Albom's faith during his childhood.  Interspersed throughout the book is the story of Henry a former drug dealer who becomes a pastor to a congregation in need.

It will make you take a look at what you're doing, whatever it is, and very well change your attitude about how you approach it.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|Just discovered this show by browsing Netflix! Love IT!   I started watching it and of course, got addicted. I've read the first and second book from Terry Goodkind, but discontinued reading the rest, because for my taste, the books are too brutal and unnecessary violent. I always liked the basic story line though.... So when I discovered the TV show, I was excited and glad that it deviated from the books. If you like fantasy, you will enjoy this. The cast is very good and draws you in. Why can't the Scifi channel come up with a series like this! Unfortunately, I am not able to watch season 2 now...
B001QWBM62|5.0|If you have a digital camera for family pix, try this too - family sound snapshots.  This device is not just for professional sound people.     I came home from a distant company work/video project and found the Amazon.com package of the Zoom H4n I ordered while I was away.  I ignored the manual as I found the recorder's controls immediately very intuitive (and I am really an audio/video amateur). I bought it as a pocket device to shove into conversations I wanted to easily capture for addition to associated video clips.       I took it home and played with it at dinner, mostly leaving it standing upright on the table center (wife and three kids and me at the table).  When I later played back what I had casually recorded at the table in 20 minutes(into my headphones - as the unit's speaker is terrible) I found a visually clear stereophonic visual/ audio image of my family comparable to a photograph but BETTER with more pertinent information as it recorded what we had to say.  It struck me that we put so much attention into the visual snapshot but an audio snapshot has its own value and in some ways can be better.  So why not carry an audio recorder to take audio snapshots in the way we may carry small digital cameras?  For this I think the pocket sized and quality H4n is ideal.  I found it very easy to use and to slip into a sweater or jacket side pocket, or even my pant's back pocket.  I think I'll carry it often.  It looks tough enough.    As for quality, the sound is good, good enough for many discriminating ears I would think.  As a reference, I use as a Sound Design 744T recorder and two omnidirectional earthworks microphones cabled to it recording at much higher sampling rates that the H4n is capable of.  The recorded sound imaging and detail of the H4n was comparably excellent. But the convenience of H4n's two microphones in an integral recorder unit is very appealing and very convenient.  Its a very high quality pocket audio recorder that I think should be in the pockets of many amateurs.      I'll leave the professional quality comparisons to others to review.

0316017922|5.0|So many people told me about this book and talking about it that I had to check it out for myself.  Found it a lot more interesting than I thought I would and it definitely changed my perspective on things.  As is mentioned in the book, in the US, we really like the idea of a \\"self-made man\\" who starts with nothing and later gets everything.  This rarely happens though and the author would argue that it never happens.  Then he goes on to explain why people are good at what they do.  That's not saying that you don't have to practice to get good.  You do.  There is so much more than putting in 10,000 hours (or more) though and this book does a great job of explaining that.
B002Q4TKAY|3.0|One of the biggest bands of this decade is without a doubt The Killers. They rocketed to the top of the charts with their debut, Hot Fuss, in 2004 and they've been selling out arenas, headlining festivals, and selling millions of copies of their albums ever since. For a band so well known for their live performances, it was only a matter of time before a live CD/DVD was produced. Two consecutive performances at the beautiful and world famous Royal Albert Hall this past July was the perfect excuse for The Killers to finally capture the energy of both the band and the fans at a Killers concert.<br /><br />Throughout the entire performance, it's obvious that The Killers want nothing else than to put on the best show their fans have ever seen. The suspenseful build up at the beginning of \\"Smile Like You Mean It,\\" the dramatically stretched intro to \\"All These Things That I've Done,\\" and even the intimate acoustic piano version of \\"Sam's Town\\" are just a few of the moments used by The Killers to set themselves apart from the thousands of bands that play their songs in concert without any emotional attachment to their music or thought given to the overall experience of the fan.<br /><br />Unlike The Who's \\"Live at Leeds\\" or Nirvana's MTV Unplugged performance, this is not a show that will be talked about for years to come, but it succeeds in stirring up the desire to see The Killers live in concert. The CD loses some of the excitement created by the light show seen on the DVD, but some of the arrangements, like the biting bass line at the beginning of \\"Jenny Was a Friend of Mine,\\" are unique to this live performance and will be an excellent addition to any fan's iPod.<br /><br />It is difficult to pull off a truly great live recording. Peter Frampton's incredibly famous Frampton Comes Alive! is one of the best selling live albums of all time and was eventually revealed to have been heavily edited and manipulated in the studio before being released. Live From the Royal Albert Hall sounds much more authentic and where it may be occasionally lacking in clarity, it makes up in honest dedication to the fans.<br /><br />Similar Artists: Muse, Oasis<br /><br />Track Suggestion: All These Things That I've Donee authentic and where it may be occasionally lacking in clarity, it makes up in honest dedication to the fans.

B0002NRQTS|5.0|I have always read or heard this album, along with 'Roll the Bones', popularly referred to as Rush's \\"worst\\" albums. Don't believe the hype. They are both very good. They are also, in my opinion, Rush's darkest and least accessible records.   The best I can describe this album is dark. This album is not for the casual or new Rush fan. It took many years for me to warm up to and appreciate the musical quality of this album. If you like a more engaging and emotional kind Rush, this is a highly recommended record.
B00288KNJU|1.0|I purchased this product to watch on Halloween and was very disappointed when (after watching preview stuff) nothing happened after clicking \\"Play Movie\\". I assumed the disk was damaged and returned it to exchange for another one. The same thing happened with the new disk. There was a message somewhere on the disk stating that it may not play on all blu-ray players. I have a Samsung Full HD 1080p player about 18 months old. I'm not about to buy a new Blu-ray player every year or so to keep up with new technology! If your player is able to view this movie, however, I found it very creative and interesting (I watched it on pay-per-view).
0765360969|5.0|This is my first Sanderson read, and it certainly won't be my last.  He creates a very rich and believable world with characters that fit within this superstitious and dreary world.  His use of magic is very unique. I think he tried not to fall into many of the \\"fantasy templates\\" and I believe he has done a great job.  It is a great read and the rest of the series follows suit.
B00005QGAT|5.0|We all know the hits, know all the songs on Thriller, Bad and Dangerous.  I really liked Invincible but Off The Wall was the one cd I heard little about (plus I admit I wasn't even born yet when he released Off The Wall).  So I ordered it from Amazon and imagine my surprise when Off The Wall turned out to be my favorite cd out of all the Michael Jackson albums I owned.      Off The Wall is great and does what a great cd should, gets you on the floor to dance and sing along.  It's fun, it makes you feel good and every song is worth listening to.  It's one of the rare cds where I play it through instead of skipping ahead to the songs I like.    Once I insert the cd into my stereo or laptop, it's guaranteed that I will play the cd at least twice.  I'm definitely happy with my purchase and many will enjoy the bonus tracks where you can hear the demo of Don't Stop Till You Get Enough and Working Day and Night, plus interviews with Quincy Jones.
B0010X745K|5.0|this film is perfect even if some people did not like the final moments. Maybe not an exactly scary movie but an agonizing one. You follow the despair of people who dont know exactly what is going on when a strange, supernatural mist literally invades a small town and envelopes everything on a horrifying and almost living shroud. A group trapped in a supermarket by the mist suddenly begins to be attacked by incredible monsters (in spectacular effects)apparently coming from some unknown zone inside the mist. Fastly the group splits in two factions, those who are afraid  and do nothing and those who are afraid and intend to take some action to scape from this twilight zone-situation, facing the unknown (oh, there is an explanation, the old cliche, an obscure military experience...). Usually the good guys win and have a happy end but here cruelly the good guys loose, taking the wrong decisions... really one of the  best horror movies of this century.
B00066VUPM|5.0|\\"Singles\\" contains the hits from Travis' first four albums. A quite impressive string of hits. Some of them may have been somewhat overplayed, but most of the songs are still a pleasure to listen to.<br /><br />It's worth noting that three songs are not found on any of the original albums. The great tune \\"Coming Around\\" was a non-album single released in 2000. Specifically for this release two new songs have been recorded. \\"Walking in the Sun\\" was released on a single and became another hit in 2004. The closing track \\"The Distance\\" is also a great song. If somebody had told me it was a new Ocean Colour Scene song, I would not have doubted this one minute.<br /><br />A minor objection to the booklet is that I find it extremely difficult to read. Very little style and half written in yellow letters. Even with my best reading glasses it requires great effort to decipher the text.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|This concert is great. We spent every year alot of time in Las Vegas. The ticket prices were between $150.00 - $300.00 per seat. So we never went too see it. This is second best, and the price is better. The concert DVD is great.
0060558121|5.0|If you are a religious person just move on to the next book.  If you are not - this is one of the best novels of the last decade.  It is enjoyable, filled with the mythos that has defined so much of our culture, and incredibly hard to put down.  Neil Gaiman's writing is impeccable - his use of language and readability is right up there with Terry Pratchett.  Better eat before you start this book, because you won't want to put it down for a meal - maybe order pizza and keep reading while you scarf your pie.
B001AQMBJQ|5.0|A lot of people did not like Season 5 of Lost. The dropping numbers of viewers prove this. Well I for one could not possibly disagree more. IMO season 5 was one of the best yet. Its the Season where Lost found its true self. Lets face it, Lost has always been a Sci Fi show, it was just set up in a way that made it more of a drama at times. This was how it was able to pull in so many viewers in the first couple of seasons as straight Sci Fi shows are never able to pull in those kinds of numbers. Well because of this dual role that Lost played, a lot of people simply forgot that Lost was in fact a Sci Fi show.<br /><br />This is why when Season 5 came along and the characters started jumping through time, a lot of people simply pulled away from the show as they didn't like the direction it was taking. Well for those of us that have understood from the beginning just what kind of show Lost really was, season 5 has easily been one of the best yet. Again this is the season where Lost found its true self, that of being a sci-fi show. In the Lost universe, time traveling is no more difficult to believe than anything we have seen on this show.<br /><br />The bottom line is that Lost has always been a Sci Fi show and it always will be. The people that have stopped watching Lost simply had a misconception about what this show really was. I for one love that the writers and producers have finally let Lost be the show that that it is. Its not a drama, its not a romantic comedy, its not a thriller, its not a comedy....its a Mystery/Sci Fi show and that is exactly what we got in Season 5.<br /><br />I am of course not really happy that they split the last season into 2 smaller seasons but what can you do. We are now approaching the start of the final season so its water under the bridge at this point.<br /><br />The bottom line - If you like the Sci-fi side of Lost then you should absolutely love season 5. Season 5 is the season where Lost came out of the closet.<br /><br />5 Stars!!

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Absolutely love this series.  They picked the perfect actor to portray Jeff Lindsay's greatest character.
B001KVZ6FW|2.0|It is a great implementation of art and graphics, and the story moves along smoothly. Unfortunately, this success is bounded by a sad drama that is unnecessary to the story, and darkens the mood. It would have been a great movie without the darkness.
B001OQCV24|4.0|Director Roland Emmerich is known for his disaster epics, such as the Sci-fi/Disaster hybrid \\"Independence Day,\\" the \\"Godzilla\\" remake, and the Global Warming thriller \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" (And to be honest, my favorite film of his is \\"The Patriot\\"). Now, he takes on the date that has millions fearing the future with his biggest disaster film yet, the epically-scaled \\"2012.\\" The film depicts the supposed end of days as predicted by the Mayans, who some claim predicted the end of days as occurring on December 21, 2012. Thought the actual theories surrounding the supposed end of time is questionable, it makes for a big, epic event film.<br />The film has a reported budget of $260 Million, and it seems that every dollar has made it to the screen. There are many big sequences in the film, and some are thrilling, even if they are a bit silly (i.e. the main actors surviving through circumstances no real human could). However, at two-hours, thirty-eight minutes, the film is overly long. By the middle of the film, the scenes of historic structures and religious symbols being pummeled by massive earthquakes become too repetitive. But the beginning and ending sequences, including the well-executed climax, make up for a lot.<br />As with \\"The Day After Tomorrow,\\" a lot of what's in the film is implausible in places. But once again, the weaknesses in the script are made up for by a terrific cast, including John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Chiwetel Ejiofor, among others. There's some good humorous moments, as with most of Emmerich's work. The music is great, and the visual effects are terrific. Overall, this is a fine film that fans of Emmerich's work are sure to enjoy.<br />Grade: B

0385504225|3.0|it was just that.  OKAY.  Entertaining, but not must read like angels and demons or davinci code.  It was not blockbuster, but it wasnt bad either.  Guessed the twist well in advance so what can I say?  Just read til the end to do so.  Neat and tidy ending but nothing mind numbing or world altering.  Just OK.  Buy electronically or wait for paperback.
0393324818|5.0|\\"Moneyball\\" captures the world of baseball from the inside -- deep inside. But it catches the sport at a critical moment, the late 1990s and early 2000s, when the old rules for picking players were about to give way to the new. In the old days, baseball scouts would watch countless young ballplayers, in high school and in college, trying to get a feel for how well they could perform years later in the big leagues. The scouts tended to rely on pitchers with scorching fast balls, fielders with fast times on the base path, and both with Adonis-like good looks. Rich teams could afford to lure these sports gods onto their overpaid rosters, giving the poorer teams few options but to scrape the bottom of the barrel and pray.<br /><br />Billy Bean, manager of the Oakland As, was one of those Adonis players that the scouts thought was a shoo-in for the Hall of Fame. But his temperament got the best of him, and he could never get used to being less than perfect. Washing out of the big leagues, he became a manager, but a manager with a visceral distrust of the system that had all but ruined him. Bean turned to a newly-formed gaggle of baseball statisticians like Bill James, who began to try to quantify what it was about winning teams that made them win. Interestingly, the number crunchers realized that many talented and useful players were being ignored by the rich teams for not fitting some pre-defined profile. Kevin Youklis, later known as the God of Walks, was a fat third baseman who didn't need to hit to get on base. Walks (!) for crying out loud, when everyone knew that hitting meant winning.<br /><br />In  \\"Moneyball\\" Michael Lewis takes us on an insider's look at the way ballplayers are selected, and on the hidden game of poaching good players from other unsuspecting managers. It's a great book that describes the group of sabermetricians (baseball statisticians) who questioned the game's stats and gave a shot to countless great players who would never been picked on looks alone. The chapter trashing batting average and RBI are worthwhile in themselves. Thank these backroom boys and girls for inserting on-base percentage and slugging percentage and other now-common metrics into the day-to-day chatter about America's pastime.<br /><br />One sad part of then book is that it does not end with the glory of the As winning a World Series, somewhat undercutting the notion that money doesn't matter. Also sad is that now even rich teams have caught onto Billy Bean's little secret. And now that the cat is out of the rosin bag, the old money game goes on. At least, that is, until another Billy Bean can exploit, even for a few years, a loophole in the standard expectations of the big boys.<br /><br />Great book, even if you are not a big baseball fan.apter trashing batting average and RBI are worthwhile in themselves.

B001G0MFOM|4.0|I loved The L Word from day one; great characters, great arcs, great story lines and lots of spice.    Each character had a uniqueness about them.  Especially the two I mention here: Alice was a complete delight (Leisha's craft in delivery was flawless).  Jenny's character was indeed complex.  You just loved hating her at certain points.  But I did hate to see her go.    What I did find lacking was a bit more realism in body types.  I, as an overweight lesbian, loved seeing the beauty in these women but the lack of people with weight issues should have been addressed.    I disagreed with the writers regarding Dana's demise.  She should have represented hope and the love for life.  We know people die from breast cancer and the devastation that surrounds it but I believe it would have been a better story line showing Dana rising above and having a positive attitude toward the disease and the lessons learned and what she possibly could do to help others.  I write this from witnessing this disease through my life partner.    And then a side bar to that, since Dana did die, and having her reappear before Alice, that should have gone on periodically through the remaining seasons.  Especially, in the very last episode when everyone was saying their good-byes...her ghost-like appearance could have shown up.    All in all I will miss my fix of The L Word.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|This movie touched my heart.  It appealed to a grown up audience as well as kiddies.  Disney is winning me over with the blu ray and dvd,  I will not buy a kids movie on blu ray since children like to watch in their rooms and they r not getting blu ray machines yet.  But when I see both blu ray and DVD are available and then at an affordable price, meaning a few dollars over the dvd version, then I go for the blu ray every time    One complaint, movie came in and teen age kid intercepted UPS delivery and he could PLAINLY see what movie this was.  After many mild threats to make sure he didnt tell his little sister what the movie was, and thanking a higher power that youngest child didnt get the movie and SEE the title, I stashed it.  But BOOOOOOO to amazon for leaving a huge open boxed window in the packaging that one can easily see or take out invoice or even peek at movie.  Is this holiday time or what?
0439023483|4.0|I thought Part One of the Hunger Games was very boring. If you can make it past Part One, you will love the rest of the book. The Hunger Games is a science-fiction book written by Suzanne Collins.  The Hunger Games takes place in the ruins of North America which is now called Panem with a filthy rich capital city. Panem also has twelve districts which are very poor. There were originally thirteen districts, but the Capital destroyed District Thirteen for rebelling. The reason for the Hunger Games is to scare the districts and to show how much stronger the Capital is than the districts.  Peeta Mellark and Katniss Evergreen have been chosen for the Hunger Games for District Twelve. Katniss Evergreen's dad died in a mine explosion, and her mother used to be a nurse. Peeta is the son of a baker. You get selected for the Games if you are twelve through eighteen. Then they put your name into a glass jar. After that, they pick one boy and one girl from each district. Each year, a total of twenty-four people get selected for the Hunger Games. The winner each year gets to live in a place called the Victor's Village. You lose by dying in the games, and your body gets shipped backed to your parents so they can see. Katniss had to wear clothes designed by Cinna for her entrance into the Capital. This was Cinna's first time at the Hunger Games, so Katniss asked \\"Did they give you District Twelve?\\" Cinna answered, \\"No, I asked for District Twelve\\" Katniss's outfit was made to be lit on fire. I wonder how Hollywood would do that if this book becomes a movie. During a television interview, Katniss acts like a little girl dancing and twirling. Peeta lies about that he and Katniss are in love. He does this so that they can get more sponsors. When Peeta gets back to the hotel, Katniss pushes him down. You could tell that Katniss wanted to kill Peeta right then and there.   Part Two was little better, but it started slowly until the games began. Peeta was playing mind games to confuseKatniss before the Hunger Games. I think that was a very smart strategy for Peeta. Haymitch, a previous winner from District Twelve, lives in Victor's village. He tells them \\"to head straight for the woods.\\" Katniss doesn't listen to Haymitch once Katniss saw her bow and arrows. While Katniss was running, she saw Peeta and gets distracted. So, instead of getting her bow, she grabs bread, backpack, and a sheet of plastic. After that, Katniss runs straight for the woods. I thought that Katniss did the right thing. If Katniss would have grabbed her bow, she probably would have been dead. I think this is where Katniss needs to get her head on straight. Katniss is worried that she has no sponsors to send her water for survival. Then Katniss trips and falls into the mud. After that, she crawls into a lake. Katniss is one lucky person. The next chapter is really funny. So, right after Katniss settles in at the lake, this gigantic wall of fire comes at her. Katniss is running for her life through vomit and smoke. She dives behind a rock, and she realized six inches of her hair was burnt. Surprisingly, Katniss dove into a fresh water pool that was not too big. Then she gets the joke Katniss, the girl on fire. Katniss's calf was burned with these gargantuan blisters on them. Then Katniss remembers how to treat burns by soaking it in cool water.  I felt really bad for Katniss because of her burns. She knows there are people around here because Katniss can hear their coughs from the smoke. So Katniss climbs up into a tree to hide. A couple minutes later, the Careers find her. The Careers are one massive alliance to win the Hunger Games. What do you think will happen between the Careers and Katniss? Where is Peeta? Who will be live, and who will die? What stunt will the Game Makers pull next? An exciting and unexpected ending is waiting in the Hunger Games. Read it today.

B002MW50KO|3.0|I'm breaking a personal rule of mine with this review. I swore that I would never review anything before listening to it completely, with near-full attention - for at least two passes. The very existence of this disk scares such fear into me that I feel that I could never commit to two full listens without developing an intractable opinion, and I admit that my anticipation borders much more closely to fear than holiday cheer. This is Bob Dylan.... (pause required)... Old. Cranky. \\"Legendary.\\" Impossibly inscrutable...(another pause required)... Bob Dylan. He's been with us - ALL of us - for over forty years. The guy's a Jew, fer Crissakes....(most of the time, anyway) and in the middle of a nearly miraculous career rebirth, he offers us a Christmas album?<br /> The first track is \\"Here Comes Santa Claus.\\" I haven't even started to play the CD yet, but if you were me, what would you expect? Do you need to think about it? As I already pointed out, this is Dylan. I haven't played a single note of this disk yet, but a) I'm showing an obvious tendency toward prejudgment, and b) I feel drawn in, like a moth circling a gas lamp. I can't help but wonder how relevant it would be if I were to actually `expose' some of the lyrics. Let's try it:<br /> \\" Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus,<br />  Right down Santa Claus lane...\\"<br /> Wow. (Another pause is DEFINITELY required now...). As I type this, I'm hearing it for the first time, and I'm dumbfounded. This album's very existence is as improbable as monkeys on the moon. OK, the heck with it. I admit it, I'm suckered in. \\"How would/could Dylan possibly sing this?\\", I ask myself. The answer, I'm feeling, is \\"Quite well\\". Maybe I'm enjoying WAY too much holiday cheer at this exact moment, but Dylan just sang \\"Winter Wonderland\\" and I felt like drinking egg nog. He sounds forced as he croaks/sings, \\"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing,\\" but as I listen, I wonder if his interpretation may have value for breaking down religious barriers. Our culture has thoroughly analyzed every syllable that Bob has ever uttered, right? Maybe non-Christians will finally be able to \\"interpret\\" Christmas songs and apply totally new meanings to them. Or, maybe that's crazy. This album is simply too weird for me to predict how any individual person might react.<br /> In terms of quantity, it's generous, with fifteen tracks. One of them is \\"Little Drummer Boy\\". Another is \\"Must Be Santa (!!), \\" but there's authentic stuff here, too, like \\"Adeste Fidelis\\" and \\"The First Noel.\\" The packaging conveys the dichotomy as well as anything possibly could. The cover shot is pure Currier and Ives, but inside is a shot that looks like vintage pin-up girl Betty Page. The music walks the same crooked path. It teases me with flashes of relevance, but then succumbs to stereotypes that border on the psychopathic. \\"The Christmas Blues\\" is easy to appreciate. \\"O Little Town of Bethlehem,\\" on the other hand, definitely is not. Once again, for the 50th time, we can't tell if Dylan is toying with us, or if he's simply following some extravagant muse. No Matter. Fifty years from now, my kids will try to capture the spirit of Christmas for their own grandkids. Doing so, they will be armed with Nat King Cole, Frank Sinatra, Phil Spector....and perhaps Bob Dylan. Christmas albums come and Christmas albums go. Despite everything we throw at it, I believe that the spirit of Christmas will nevertheless survive. As Bob sings, \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\\" `B'...or maybe `C', or maybe even `A'.

B001B93PQ0|5.0|Of course most of the music on this album isn't new. While there are a few offerings on this album that you will be unable to find anywhere else the flavor of everything else is completely unique. From the word \\"go\\" you can tell this album is going to rock with a sweet jazz opening to Neon, John does an excellent job of sneaking awesome introductions and solos into his best songs. His cover of Hendrix's Wait Until Tomorrow is quite possibly the best cover of that song in existence. From start to finish the entire album is worth it. John didn't cobble together a piece of crap here this album has subtle and more refined renderings on already good music. It isn't just that he makes the guitar parts better every song has something new to offer the privileged listener, his vocal stylings on Gravity, Slow Dancing, and Stop this Train reflect a highly trained falsetto flashing the pipes, with a cool whistle solo even. This album is worth it's weight in gold. Buy it now.

B000WDS1OC|1.0|I've owned several pairs of these in the last 30 years. I used to love them. But I won't buy them again.    The last pair had rubber soles poorly glued to the leather insole. Several exposures to wet weather resulted in the soles coming loose. Regluing them never seem to work. Heavy shoes like these, with soles like these, commonly are bought for use in bad weather. It's not like I went hiking in patent leather tuxedo pumps and then complained because they didn't hold up well.    All shoes made in China are not necessarily inferior. But Timberlands aren't what they used to be.

B002PJ4H0I|5.0|The first book I read in 2009 and also the best.  Montefiore's background as a historian comes through in the thrilling and realistic picture he paints of the Russian Revolution, the height of the Stalinist Terror and the months following the fall of the USSR.  The attempts of both heroines to navigate their changing worlds are sympathetic and vivid, and the supporting characters (including those of historical figures) are well-developed, too.  As much as I enjoy Montefiore's non-fiction work, I sincerely hope he continues his foray into fiction as well.

If the original Trek cast had been in this movie--and it would not have been tough to taylor it a bit back to its original source--it could've been a hilarious classic in the Trek canon.<br /><br />But I don't want to take anything away from the cast in the film.  Tim Allen really breaks out of his stand-up/sitcom persona and plays a Shatner-esque role.  I was really surprised as to how good he was in this movie.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver is almost too intimidating as a serious actress.  Depsite the blond hair and push-up bra, she's still Sigourney Weaver, Academy Award nominated actress.  In GHOSTBUSTERS, she played the straight gal to Bill Murray, an Academy Award nominated comedian.  In GALAXY QUEST, she's playing another washed-up sci fi actress...but I still see Sigourney Weaver!  Wasn't too distracting and she was very good.  (But when you think about it, how great could some of the typecast actors and actresses have been if they hadn't been pigeon-holed by a iconic role?)<br /><br />Alan Rickman is another incredibly talented actor (although best known as Hans Gruber, the slick German mastermind in DIE HARD).  If he hadn't been hidden under his silly alien makeup, his impressive talent might have been distracting as well--but it's not!  He's excellent.  The rest of the cast is great as well, especially Tony Shalhoub and Sam Rockwell.<br /><br />One of the reasons I waited to see this film was because I thought it would goof on the Trek fans.  With scenes at a sci-fi convention and fans as characters, I was afraid that the film would pile on to make fun of them.  Kind of like when Shatner did the \\"Saturday Night Live\\" sketch where he tells the Trekkies to \\"get a life.\\"  Funny, but too easy of a target.<br /><br />Well, GALAXY QUEST doesn't take that easy route.  It doesn't poke fun at the fans.  In fact, the fans actually come out as heroes in some scenes.  It's a film that understands the fan's affection and doesn't insult them.<br /><br />A funny and fun movie!  Check it out.oesn't poke fun at the fans.

B002NPUCIA|2.0|I am a great fan of Brian Culbertson, but while listening to his new CD I was saying to myself I have heard some of the songs before.And true to form some of these songs have been on other CD's that I have purchased.Now don't get me wrong he has a few new songs on it, and they are very good. Is he trying to pull the wool over his fans eyes? What was he thinking? I paid money good money for a CD I  already have.I think but now I could be wrong it had been a year since his last CD and he did a rush job just to get something out in stores to began a new year with. From now on I will not pre-order I will wait and listen to it on Amazon first.Brian you let me down.
B000002C2E|4.0|Great album.  Had this one in my collection for must have been ten years before I really got into it.  Tried many times but it just was too dark and didn't connect with me.  Maybe it is because I am older now, but I now realize it has some of Dylan's best songs here. Since getting into it a month ago I have played over and over songs like \\"Not Dark Yet\\", \\"Standing in the Doorway\\" and \\"Tryin' to get to heaven\\".  This is a black coffee kind of album.  Dark lyrics from a guy who has seen a lot over the years.
141654917X|5.0|If you seen the movie, I say read the book. it's the same but not as much as you think it is.<br /><br />I knew of this book for a while now, but i didn't know what's it was all about, but of course, I ended up letting it piled up in my TBRs for the longest time. Until the movie came....<br /><br />I have a soft spot in anything that's being regard as a \\"spare part child\\". It has become an itch, or a peeve if you may, an issue this book has managed to portray.<br /><br />I found myself trying to read it through whenever I could. This book comprised of first hand experience from all of the characters involved. The book centered on Anna, the specially engineered child by their parents, to be the sole donor for her older sister Kate, who is suffering from a rare kind of Leukemia. One day, she just suddenly said she had enough and decided to court to apply for Medical emancipation from her parents.<br /><br />Personally this book is an emotional read for me. I got so absorbed in it, and I found myself feeling sorry for Anna through out the book. Regardless screaming somebody die already because i wanted to finish the book asap too lol.
B001GQACGO|5.0|i loveeee this album! it gives you the  best of beyonce and sasha fierce! she had evolved as an artist and gets deeper on her material. the album offers a balance that i needed and i can play both cd's straight through! long live the queen!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I purchased the SB 400 because my SB 600 developed a short circuit.  I was told this would not effect the 600s performance on my D50, nor adversely effect the D50 itself.  Not wanting to take the chance, I got the 400 for use until I can have the 600 repaired.  I have come to really appreciated this little flash.  While I do love the 600, I guess I didn't realize just how cumbersome it can sometimes be on the camera.  This SB 400 is very small but with big advantages over the on board flash.  I always use the 90 degree bounce for indoor shots of birthday parties and such events.  Never a red eye problem.  The quality of the photo is much improved over the \\"straight on\\" position.  I won't repeat all the positive things said about this unit in the other reviews, except to say that I agree with all the praise this SB 400 has earned.  I would appreciate a rotating head on the flash, but then it wouldn't be as inexpensive as it is now.  I have not had a low battery life problem, but if you do do, try the Sanyo Eneloop batteries or 8X Energizer lithium product.  I wonder why I waited to get this SB 400.  Well, I guess I didn't need it until the 600 developed it's problem.  The 400 does 85-90% of anything I need and feels so natural and non-cumbersome atop the D50.  I'll have the 600 repaired, but have the feeling I'll be using the 400 much more than first expected.  Don't let it's small size fool you.  It's a fine and powerful little flash which, I think, you will come to appreciate more than you expect.

B002SK2X3C|4.0|Probably a lot more than is written in this book.    It is, no doubt a near forensic description of Larry McDonald's experiences in Lehman Brothers and the events that lead up to Chapter 11 filing in mid September 2008, by any measure there was a failure. A failure of a corporation to manage it's risk and ensure it remained liquid.    But there are more failures as well, failures by people as described in detail within this book, others just lightly touched upon, and the unstated failures of people who knew that it was all going to go bad back in 2006 yet did not call it out to those who are responsible for prudential oversight of the financial services industry.    As Voltaire said: \\"Common sense is not that common.\\",    I gave this book a 4/5
B0024FAR5W|4.0|Great show, doesn't get boring at any time in the first season.  Watched all episodes, Katy Sagal is perfect in her role, when I first saw her on the screen I didn't think she would pull off the switch from Peg Bundy to Biker mama but within one minute Peg Bundy never came to mind, this is Katys role!
B002V0WN2K|4.0|To compare BonJovi to Springsteen is an insult to BonJovi!  On his best day Bruce couldn't have the vocals of Jon Bon Jovi.  Another comment said this was more \\"easy listening\\" than the \\"hair band\\" days.  Not really, IMO.  It has the comfort level of listening to a good BonJovi cd which is what is expected.  If you want heavy metal/big hair sound you're gonna have to find another group.  Keep up the good work, guys.
B002MBAJ4M|1.0|I waited for this cd more than any other release by The Mule just because they kept saying Danny was going to be playing more guitar on this one. But after one listen I thought it was the worse Mule cd i have heard but i thought maybe if I listened to it a couple more times something might happen. Nothing ever happened it is just a lame recording. Warren doesn't play anything good as far as I can hear. It sounds much more like The grateful Dead than Government Mule. I am glad I heard it before I bought tickets to see them because I would have been pissed tp pay money to hear them play any of these songs. Thank god for all the mule recordings before this. And as far as Bass players I think andy is/was much better than this new guy. Sorry to say it but I think the new cd is a waste of time and money.

0385504225|4.0|A fun book to read, yet a bit longer than it should be. The science is somewhat shakey, but one realizes that this is a novel, and the writer can take liberty with facts. Since the hub of Brown's book is the antagonist, after his demise it ahould not drag on as much as it does, it soon becomes anti-climatic.<br />Not knowing very much about the Masons, and realizing that this is a book of fiction, a non-Mason reader either gathers a great deal of knowledge, or is filled with a myth about what Masonary is, does, and what it represents. If nothing else, unless one has knowledge of the subject, the book leaves the reader awed by the Masons, and by the impressive membership of that organization.<br />Having once had a brother-in-law who was a Mason, it is difficult for me to visualize how a person such as he, could subscribe to the rituals Dan brown describes. Since it is common knowledge that many Masons occupy important places in society, Brown leaves the reader wonder how such intelligent people can accept some of the strange behavior that he attributes to that organization.<br />In spit of some of the detailed gore, the book is enjoyable; and if Dan Brown's description of the Masons, their rituals, and their purpose, is accurate, one is left wondering what are the appropriate beliefs and behavioral guidelines of \\"civilized\\" society.<br />The main shortcoming of the book is its anti-climatic ending which spans some 10% of the total work, but that could have been accomplished in a very few pages...
B0002PZVH0|5.0|Brian Eno didn't invent ambient music -- that is usually credited to DeBussy, though whales and world musicians may have something to say about that -- but Eno refined it to its essential components.  Ambient Music for Airports distills its raw ambience into its pure tonal and resonant parts, creating a simple, yet perfect collection of tracks that soothes the soul, even when that soul seems too soulful to sooth.  Though the attuned and spoiled ear picks up some early 80s imperfections and patch noise, flaws in the construction all become part of the ambient color: just another hue of that particular sound. This is a requirement for all ambient and electronica collections, and ESSENTIAL for all others.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|This is a great movie for children and adults alike.  I actually bought it because I have a boxer puppy and he loves to watch anything with animals. I laugh more from his antics then from the movie, but the movie is fun, entertaining and a great family movie.
B001DDBCUK|3.0|\\"The moral of the story is, If you try to pollute the New York Public Library with your frou-frou, something terrible will happen.\\" - Jessica Zafra    Bad or good, if you are a fan of the series - you just have to see the movie. And fortunately, this movie spin-off doesn't end up totally badly. What can we expect, anyway, from a big franchise such as this? Product placements all over, no less, like it's the designer names' and Vogue's field day. Three years after the series finale, somebody has got to make up for an update in today's couture via our four beloved girls. In an over-the-top-it's-almost-in-bad-taste way, that is. Honestly, during the first half of the movie, I was ready to walk out if I saw another Pucci-whatever print dress, pair of oversized hoop earrings or ankle boots. If these girls have enough money to wear labels, couldn't they have bought something appropriate yet equally fabulous for the trip to Mexico? I am very disappointed in that red dress Miranda wore... I mean, to a resort, dear? I thought the character was much more sensible than that.    My version of the Jessica Zafra moral lesson is - \\"make your wedding day all about the dress, and you bring it upon yourself if that's all you stand next to at the altar.\\" I'm not going to lecture about materialism because this movie is obviously not about moral lessons anyway, but it's just that the first half reminded me a lot about why I never liked Carrie Bradshaw in the series until she got her karma in Berger. When she took off her glasses in front of the mirror in Mexico, I wanted to say, \\"Girl, you should've spent as much money on anti-ageing creams as on your Manolo Blahniks, 'cause I think Big got scared seeing a preview of the future.\\"    And so as her karma unfolded, the movie, too, started to redeem itself, with its focus on relationships. The writers seemed to have gained the upper hand over merchandising department this time. The new character Louise was a fresh touch. I liked the parallelism in Carrie and Miranda's fight and the latter's relationship with Steve. And the tear-inducing scenes that make it the quintessential chick flick have totally overshadowed the predictable happy ending for every character (yes, including Javier and Anthony) in the movie.    Predictable, yes, but it is what we came to the theater for - to see our modern day heroines remind us about the value of friendship and forgiveness and being your own self, whether you live in the city or not.
B002L3RVCY|4.0|This set collects the 22 episodes that comprise the first season of Star Wars: The Clone Wars. It follows the theatrical pilot, available separately as [[ASIN:B001GQSY5K Star Wars: The Clone Wars (Widescreen Edition)]]. Each adventure recounts the dramatic battles of the Clone Wars that take place between Episodes II and III of the movie saga.<br /><br />I had skipped season one during its initial broadcast - having caught the theatrical movie and not being impressed - but after watching through this set, I'm quite pleased with the results. What wasn't quite theatrical quality animation is in contrast leaps and bounds above conventional TV animation. This is some eye-popping stuff here - even accounting that Lucasfilm probably shelled out a bit more than your average TV budget, there are epic space battles, intricate Lightsaber duels, new planets and characters, and more. It's Star Wars, and it feels right. The stories are a mix of singular installments and two or three-part sagas. In a fun convention, each episode begins with a serial-style recap, regardless of whether or not there actually was a direct preceding installment. You can pretty much jump in at any point in the season and be up to speed.<br /><br />What doesn't work? The Battle Droids remain chatty and Jar Jar still makes you want to turn your TV off. Ahsoka Tano ends up faring much better than she did in the theatrical pilot - more eager apprentice and less \\"Sky Guy\\" arrogance. Really, the series' biggest fault is that ultimately, little of consequence can actually happen - the majority of characters meet their fate in Episode III, and as pointed out in the bonus features, Anakin and General Grevious can't actually meet face-to-face. The best stories revolve around the Clone Troopers or aspects of the war that don't directly involve trying to end it.<br /><br />This is a nicely produced DVD set - there is an attached booklet of concept art from the show, and each episode comes with a mini featurette that has cool production tidbits. I did find the set somewhat expensive - the Canadian sale price is higher than the American MSRP, so Americans are really getting a deal with this one.<br /><br />If you like Star Wars, this is worth picking up.tidbits.

081095415X|5.0|Every page in this book is stunning almost to the point of being hypnotic. I highly recommend it for your personal collection or as a gift for anybody that likes photography or that just appreciates raw beauty. It might even be worth buying two copies, one for cutting the pages out and framing them and the other to keep.
0375836675|2.0|This was a book that was hard to put down... yet at the same time I'm hesitant to say that I liked it. Obviously the writing drew me in, but the ending seemed a bit bizarre and contrived. Also, some of the actions the main character took along the way I found horrifying. I was also a bit surprised that this was a young adult book. There is no way I would ever let my teenager read this book - much too violence in a couple sections. I am not really a fan of someone beating the heck out of someone else \\"for their own good.\\" So while I sped through the book fairly quickly, I have a hard time recommending it to anyone else.
B00001OH7G|5.0|Where has this disc been all my life?  I knew about Rory Gallagher of course, I even owned one of his studio LP's back in the 70's (Tattoo, I believe it was), but somehow this live LP escaped my attention.  After reading the overwhemlingly positive reviews here, I ordered a copy.      I have to say his studio work doesn't do him justice.  This disc is a revelation!  After hearing it twice, I can unequivically say at the time this was released in 1974, Rory Gallagher was the best rock/blues guitarist working.  Hendrix and Duane Allman were dead, Clapton was just coming out of a three-year heroin haze, and was doing far from his best work.  Maybe Jeff Beck, another criminally underrated guitarist was as good, but he was getting into jazz fusion at the time.    Every track on this disc blazes with intensity.  Rory's band is tight and polished, and his guitar work is endlessly creative.  If I had to pick a favorite cut, it would be \\"A Million Miles Away\\", because that's where  it takes me, but that's not to slight any other track here.  I wish I'd seen him live back in those days, but he didn't play the States much, and wasn't well publicized when he did.  Oh well, now I have to buy the Montreux DVD.

B0025KVLU6|4.0|Like a lot of people, I think this double album should have been pared down to a single record.  I could easily live without \\"Martha My Dear\\", \\"Don't Pass Me By\\", \\"Bungalow Bill\\", \\"Ob-La-Di Ob-La Da\\", \\"Revolution 9\\" and several others.  But what I do like here is some of the Beatles best work.  \\"Dear Prudence\\" is as good a song as they ever did, \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" is my favorite George Harrison song, and contains one of Eric Clapton's most heartfelt guitar solos.  \\"Blackbird\\" and \\"Julia\\" are achingly beautiful.  Great stuff on here.    The new remastered disc (I have the stereo) sounds incredible.  I've heard five of the new versions, Beatles for Sale, Past Masters, Revolver, The Beatles, and Abbey Road, and this one and Abbey Road sound the best, although they are all much improved from the previous 1987 vintage CD's.  I only hesitate to award it five stars because I have to skip fully half the songs on this disc.  But to me, it's still well worth buying.

Chris Daughtry, the most successful loser on American Idol, likes his grunge-lite and radio friendly, even while he and his mates pose like bad boys. The little girls may understand, the boys get the faux menace, and the moms raised on Bon Jovi and [[ASIN:B0000256NE Bad Company]] just might dig them, too. As the lead single states, \\"No Surprise\\" indeed.<br /><br />Daughtry likes their hooks thick and melodic, which makes all the songs here easy to digest. And Chris is a solid songwriter, with both \\"Ghost Of Me\\" and \\"Life After You\\" really good songs. There's just not much here that you haven't heard a thousand times before, done better. I get no sense that Daughtry is pushing themselves, although the uber-compressed production would probably bury anything remotely subtle. \\"Leave This Town\\" is so wretchedly flat-boxed that I was getting ear-fatigue by the time Vince Gill's country choirboy vocal appeared on \\"Tennessee Line.\\" (Shades of Bon Jovi and [[ASIN:B0015D3Z80 Def Leppard's]] song with Tim McGraw!)<br /><br />Bottom line: Did you like the first [[ASIN:B000IY04RC Daughtry]], latest Nickleback or Bon Jovi's Nashville outing?

0385341008|5.0|THE GUERNSEY LITERARY AND POTATO PEEL PIE SOCIETY<br /><br />If you read only one book this year or next year or the years ahead of that, make sure this is THE book.<br /><br />Like the thousands of reviewers before me, I found this book to be a delight.  What a smart and totally different way to tell a story -- in the form of letters and telegrams between all of the characters.  A book has never left me feeling so charmed and under its spell.<br /><br />We meet Juliet Ashton, living in London after World War II.  Juliet wants to write a book and keeps running into dead ends.  She receives a letter from a man who lives in Guernsey and they strike up a correspondence relationship, which leads to Juliet hearing from others who live on the island.  She is invited to visit and decides to go and let the people tell her their true stories about the German occupation.  Once at Guernsey, Juliet falls in love with the island, her once pen-pal friends, and the life she is living there.  Read the book and find out all of the details of Juliet's life in this lovely place; it is quite the adventure.<br /><br />History comes alive for both the reader and Juliet while on Guernsey.  I personally discovered so much about this phase in our world history that before was totally unknown to me.  Little did I know that this beautiful island even existed, let alone that it was occupied by the Nazis.  Story after story is unfolded straight from the human heart.  The characters are so alive and well thought out that I found it hard to believe they weren't real and living down the street from me.  This book contains the misery and heartbreak that only war can bring; however, hand-in-hand with that heartbreak comes the true human condition -- love, fellowship towards man, and triumph.<br /><br />The characters themselves all have voices of their own, each one conveying what happened to them during the war and how their world was torn apart.  The authors were able to make each character so different and unique it was unbelieveable.  Taking actual historical events and putting the characters right in the thick of things came off so smoothly and made this book a true treasure.  Some advice?  Keep a box of tissue handy, you will certainly be using them.<br /><br />As stated above, if you only read one book in the years to come, make sure it is this one.  I highly recommend this book to everyone.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Pam.

For great pacing and characters that would be cartoonish in the hands of lesser directors but believable and interesting in the hands of Tarantino, I highly recommend this film. It is worth owning and rewatching.
B002L6NYBS|5.0|An excellent comedic romp, through a very Politically Incorrect All Girls School, for very interesting ladies. This is very British in that it pokes fun at all the English Stereotypes. It shows what British Society is really like under the façade of enforced cultural requirements.
B002VWNID6|3.0|...is what a commercial advertising the 1938 version of Robin Hood had to say in the summer of 1991 regarding the advertisement for this film claiming \\"This summer Kevin Costner is Robin Hood\\". The voice of the pronouncement was from the actor that defined the role of Robin Hood and the role of the swashbuckler in general - Errol Flynn.<br /><br />Not only does Kevin Costner not sound like Robin Hood, he doesn't act like him either. His performance doesn't even come close to that of Flynn. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is good enough in her performance as Marian, but still you can't compare the chemistry between Errol Flynn and Olivia De Haviland to whatever is there between 1991's Marian and Robin. Do note that this version does show more of the tragedy that befalls the peasants than was present in the 1938 version. This emphasis on tragedy and drama is probably there to offset the fact that since Kevin Costner can't even begin to swash Errol Flynn's buckle, and comes across more like a social worker who is good at archery, the film had to take the emphasis off of the great fun and energy of Robin Hood himself.<br /><br />The one saving grace of this film is Alan Rickman as the Sheriff of Nottingham. His use of the black arts is shown openly as was not possible in the 1938 version, demonstrating the true evil measure of the man, and at the same time he gets off some great comic one liners and manages to steal the picture. Claude Raines, who played Prince John in the 1938 version, would have been proud of this performance.<br /><br />If you want to see an intentionally comic rendition of Robin Hood, see Mel Brooks' \\"Robin Hood Men in Tights\\". That movie succeeded at least partially by playing off some of the ludicrous aspects of this one. As for Warner Bros., if you want to update some of your old DVD's how about a new standard DVD release of \\"Stand and Deliver\\". The original is now twelve years old.
0786868724|5.0|This is a wonderful story which Mitch Albom beautifully narrates with a blend of wit and poignance.  Most of us, from time to time, have experienced some sort of struggle with believing in a higher power, or doubt the good intentions of people we know.  We grow suspicious and maybe even lose faith in mankind.  This book will help restore that faith.  I loved it.

God knows, we get enough nasty betrayals in real life without getting blasted with it in a book whose ending seemed, until the last 20pages, to promise what would have been a satisfying closure on so many levels.  I don't know if I have the emotional fortitude to read another of Ms. Waters' books...
0679409866|5.0|My wife loves owning the classics (including Austen) and went looking for a good hardcover publisher of her favorite books. She absolutely LOVES the Everyman's Library hardcovers. They are a perfect fit for reading - large enough to read and feels substantial, but not oversized and bulky. Perfect \\"curl up on a rainy day with a good book\\" size! She drop hints all the time that any of these would be a great gift!

B000AYEL6U|5.0|Seeing and owning this has placed the BBC production of Pride and Prejudice to my no. 2 slot and I never thought than anything could surpass it.  I love it and after seeing another person's copy of it, I had to own my own.  I will watch this time after time and never tire of the image, the music and love story and the story of how the industrial revolution affected lives of common people who worked at the mills.  It's truly a story of tragedy, love and triumph.  Well well done.
0385532458|5.0|This is a lovely collection of short stories.  They have a southern thread and yet they each deliver their own punch.  The characters are fully developed - even for a short story form - and the stories flow easily.  The stories have just enough legalese to keep us tethered to what we love most about John Grisham.  However, the stories give John Grisham license to go into story-lines and situations that are not his usual genre.  I enjoyed the book thoroughly.
B00003CXFG|5.0|I love this movie.  Too bad in the sequel (and video game) they deviated from the original concept of Riddick being an anti-hero badass from some space ghetto to being a supernaturally powered alien(?) from furia or wherever.  Sequel is still fun, but this movie is where it's at.

1416550534|4.0|This is a lovely first book by author Kate Morton. I don't want to give away too much, but I'll say this: yes, it's predictable. As another reviewer pointed out, by around page 50 or so, you can tell at least one of the \\"twists\\" because the clues aren't exactly subtle. This didn't detract from my enjoyment of the story. There is a certain warmth (for lack of a better word) to the writing that made me want to read on. It's the kind of book you want to read while curled up in a comfy chair, sipping tea.     So, to summarize: yes, it has its issues. Yes, it's still enjoyable. I look forward to reading her next book. I think she has potential.

B001AIRUOU|5.0|The combination of Tim Burton's vision and direction, Danny Elfman's score and the outstanding stop-motion animation plus the enchanting and original story make this one of Disney's all-time best animated stories.  It has been my favorite since it was released, but I introduced my 2 and 4 year old grandchildren to the video when I purchased this copy.  They are totally mesmerized by the story and the music.  The more they see it, the more delighted they become with the characters and their personalities. They've started to be curious about the way the animation is done, as well.  As a bonus, it's an all-purpose holiday film which lasts the entire season from Halloween through Christmas!
B0021L8UVC|4.0|The film starts off with an interesting premise, but the storyline seems to get more and more tangled up in itself as its twists and turns unravel. The viewer is left slightly disoriented by the time it's all said and done. There's at least two twists in there and several complicated conversations explaining what's actually going on. The other big problem for me was the fight scenes. Even though Christian Alvart is in the director's chair this time around, it seems as though some of Anderson's filming techniques left an impression on him as I remember having the same problem during the Resident Evil films (mainly Apocalypse). It's just hard to make out what's going on at times. You know someone has been stabbed or punched or kicked, but the camera zipping around so much sometimes makes it hard to see who is doing what.<br /><br />While Pandorum's storyline does seem to have about three turns too many and it's a bit difficult to make out what's going on when the action gets intense, it still managed to meet my expectations and be exactly what I was looking for with this type of film. Ben Foster definitely steals the show (Dennis Quaid is pretty good, as well) and the creatures in the film look similar to the ones from The Descent, which makes me think of this film as the offspring of Event Horizon and The Descent. If you're a fan of Event Horizon, Resident Evil, Aliens, or Sunshine, then this may be worth checking out. Considering its reputation, however, it'll probably have to be filed with the rest of my guilty pleasures.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This rendition of the story with so much more focus on the relationship between Jane and Rochester, wins hands-down in many ways.  Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens gives the two characters life.  Stephens is a great actor, definitive, and a believable, emotional Rochester, and Wilson is as I would imagine Jane would truly be.  In her voice, and her eyes, facial expressions, Jane's character comes through, strengths and weaknesses, delivering a believable Jane.    I have watched the two disc adaptation numerous times now and each time I get so caught up in Jane's emotions as she comes to love Thornfield Hall, and Adele, and the other staff, and of course Edward Rochester.  Her emotions on screen are captivating especially when she grieves for being apart from Rochester.  And I truly like the fact that the story is also told, in some scenes from Rochester's point of view.  You experience the tug of his emotions, his struggle with the dark secret he carries, and his growing admiration and love for this girl who is becoming such an important part of his life.    Both players are truly excellent at portraying their characters, and I loved it.  For me it is worthy of being part of the Masterpiece library.     I have been, for a long time, an arduous fan of the Jane Eyre remake that sported Zelah Clark as Jane and Timothy Dalton as Mr. Rochester.  As an ardent Dalton fan, I remain a fan of that adaptation as it is a lovely replay.  I place this rendition with Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens on par with it as each tells the story in its unique way and both are beautifully and wonderfully done with performers who know how to strut their stuff.
B002RDGR2I|5.0|Boy, talk about challenges: The Editors is bombarded with comparisons to bands both new and old (Interpol and Joy Division) based on their first two albums. Now The Editors try something a bit different from those two albums and people are reacting as if the ship sank. Can't please everyone all the time I guess...<br /><br />The album is good. Yes I was taken aback by the heavy electronic presence. While I'm a big fan of guitar-based rock, I can see how this is a natural extension of the Editors' sound. Let's face it --their use of instruments is close to a pulsing, mechanical sound than not. They are not known for riffs, they are known for rhythm. There are numerous tracks on their old albums where much of the guitar could be swapped for electronic elements and you'd hardly notice.<br /><br />Again, at first listen I was kinda thinking \\"...What?\\". But after a few listens you feel The Editors (albeit a little dark --not that it's a bad thing.)<br /><br />And I like the lyrics. They are kind of weird and as such lend to a unique identity for the band. Again, if there are so many comparisons to pre-existing bands, it's great that they are going off into their own world. More power to them --Editors keep it up.

B002OR18HQ|4.0|I really like this show...but it's bit too country for me. The best song is \\"Keep on Chooglin\\". He doesn't play enough Creedence songs. And all the instruments are \\"sub-dued\\" in relation to his. His guitar is louder than anyone else's instruments, especially when his bandmates play solo. It is very dissappointing. It's like he is such a Rock God that he won't let anyone else play at the same level of volume. sad.
B001KVZ6FW|4.0|Disney/Pixar's latest DVD release \\"Up\\" is one of the sweetest movies I've ever seen!  I laughed, I cried, I laughed until I cried - a lot!  Squirrel!  This bold, colorful, masterfully written and assembled feature follows an adventurous boy from childhood to realization of his dreams in his elder years.  It is a story of love and friendship and loyalty.  And just like the best animated features, this film will enchant young and old alike.<br /><br />Carl and Ellie are adventurers.  They meet, fall in love, marry, and life happens in such a way that they are unable to live their dreams.  When Carl snatches the opportunity to finally live the adventure, he reluctantly befriends Russell and Dug, meets the hero of his childhood, and learns that life itself is the real adventure.<br /><br />The special features on the DVD are limited to a couple of cute short films.  This DVD is definitely worth a rental.  Purchasing may be a bold move for those who like a bittersweet story with a happy ending.
B001IAOEXU|4.0|At its price point, these triggers should probably be tried by anyone who is remotely unhappy with the L2/R2 buttons on their PS3 controller. The product itself is brilliant in its simplicity. It's just a pair of molded molded plastic pieces that pop on and off of a PS3 controller. The installation was easy and the fit is solid.    As far as who will like it, it's all personal preference. I had found that my fingers could easily slip off of L2/R2, and the triggers solved this issue. However, now I find that I accidentally hit these buttons at times. The real question is whether you're interested in greater sensitivity for L2/R2 buttons. Even if you are unsure, the price makes it worth a try.
B00192IV0O|2.0|Like others have said, too much audio-tone (or whateveritscalled) in this album. Just kinda feels like they phoned it in, talent-wise. Empty music with some good beats, but lyrically, boring as crap. I liked their older stuff better and I'm glad I only paid $5 for this. Save your $ and buy a few of the songs you like and toss the rest. The whole album isn't worth it.
0061914177|5.0|The first time I watched Wine Library TV, I was intrigued. Gary was so unique in a world that most perceive as a subject to be discussed by stuffy, snooty intellectuals.  Sure he is over the top at times - my wife refers to him as that \\"obnoxious wine guy\\" but he gets your attention and he knows what he is talking about. The video blog is the perfect vehicle for him because it suits his character so well.     One very good thing about his book is this: it is short. I mean that as a compliment, not as in \\"thank goodness it is over with.\\"  There are far too many books out there that have a bunch of useless pages simply to justify a high purchase price or make people think it is filled with knowledge but for most of these books you could cut out a large percentage of the pages and not lose a thing as far as useful information.  Gary's book is to the point and it is not one big advertisement for his business, either.  His personality really comes across in the words so it is like either you are watching his blog or listening to him in person.  This book is about establishing your brand, your true identity that reveals your passion to people, and that is exactly what he does here - his brand comes across nice and clear. He also has a lot of very sensible and useful things to tell you about how to monetize your passion, though it is not a book that worships money. It is about being happy and if you are passionate about something and are lucky enough to make a living from it, then you are doing very well indeed.    There have been some who criticize the book because they say that use of social media is so widespread these days, it has become a ho-hum thing compared to being more cutting edge back when Gary began using it. In a sense that is true; just like in the early days of the internet web sites were very primitive and people who were able to create one had the advantage over those who did not simply because they had a web site. But while web sites are now much more commonplace, that doesn't mean that they are no longer effective. It is what you do with the site that counts, and that is what Gary is trying to get across in his book. It is what you do with your passion that counts. While Facebook, Twitter, etc. have become much more popular, there is still plenty of room for people who are willing to work very hard to be successful. You just have to work harder these days because there is more competition. But if you follow your passions (instead of doing something just for the money) and create a game plan, that still gives you the edge over all the people who don't even bother to try, or whose efforts are half-hearted. The message is if you are passionate, you're going to have fun doing what you do and success will follow.     There's a lot more in the book to like. I don't agree with everything Gary said but I find there is no denying his passion and enthusiasm and that comes across on every page. It is well worth reading even if you've heard it all before, because of hearing it from his perspective as well as letting his words serve as a motivator and reminder. We can all use a kick to get us going!      I felt this was a worthwhile read. It is short and to the point with a great ratio of useful content per page.
0740785508|5.0|In the introduction for \\"Imaginative Realism\\", James Gurney describes his book, in terms of what it is not: a step-by-step drawing and anatomy guide (of humans or dinosaurs, as the author of Dinotopia puts it) nor is it a recipe guide for particular painting techniques. He's right of course, although the book contains elements of all this and much more.     \\"Imaginative Realism\\" is one of those art books that can appeal not just to practitioners of illustration at all levels but fans as well. Gurney takes this work very seriously and plots a direct lineage to nineteenth and twentieth century masters of the form. We've seen this kind of \\"realistic fantastical\\" illustration in old books and magazines and it's fascinating to see how a contemporary artist can reinvent the approach in such a fresh way.     The book takes the form of a series of two or three page spreads, each illustrating a particular aspect of the creative process that goes into creating the kind of illustrations Gurney has done for magazines such as National Geographic as well as his before-mentioned Dinotopia series of books. Gurney portrays \\"realism\\" even when it includes fantastical elements such as creatures organic and robotic. He juxtaposes the most natural human portrayals with, well, the most unnatural situations and characters and makes it all look as ordinary as Norman Rockwell (one among many he obviously admires).He seems to have soaked up a vast ocean of illustration and has the chops to filter and reassemble it at will.    There's low-level drawing and painting techniques and tools as well as the details of furnishing one's studio for effective and efficient work. There's high-level concept and \\"drawing\\" inspiration from the work of past masters. The historical asides really add to the sense of past connection. Gurney obviously relishes sharing his passion for the masters of this genre and it makes for contagious reading.
B002S0OBFK|5.0|Okay, I was wrong.<br /><br />When The Blair Witch Project came out, the movie was suitably freaky. The \\"what if\\" premise was as much a part of the film's terror as the movie itself. Unfortunately, the hype was as artificial as the movie itself: friends of the producers spread rumors on the Internet that The Blair Witch Project was the scariest movie ever.  Sound familiar?<br /><br />So you can understand my skepticism when Paranormal Activity released in a limited number of theaters, practically begging viewers on its web site to ask to see it.  The exclusivity was clearly meant to make people only want to see the movie even more.  Considering the numerous first-time posters on dozens of horror forums proclaiming it \\"the scariest movie ever\\" and...well, I didn't believe them.<br /><br />I was wrong. Paranormal Activity, about a modern couple trying to survive a demonic haunting, does everything right.<br /><br />* It takes the documentary medium a step further than Blair Witch, primarily used the style to make the film feel raw.  That unfiltered feel is also present in Paranormal Activity, but the film goes beyond that by playing with time stamps.  As the time stamp speeds up or slow down, the producers torque the tension.<br /><br />* Never has a single open bedroom door been so disturbing. It conveys, by being open night after night, a sense of vulnerability, acts as a gateway between worlds, and symbolizes a violation of sanctuary. I couldn't take my eyes off the door the entire movie.<br /><br />* Silence.  Paranormal Activity uses silence to freak out the audience.  Our own fears build and build in the vacuum of sound.  In fact, the silence was so deafening that the sound from the movies playing next door and the clicking of the film projector proved a distraction.  In that regard Paranormal Activity might be even scarier on a small screen.<br /><br />* Whether it's propping up the false bravado of Micah or the dire predictions of The Psychic, there are no heroes here. And when someone a solution is finally identified as being capable of helping...it is tantalizingly out of reach.<br /><br />This movie's plot isn't anything new. The same territory has been covered by The Haunting, Poltergeist, and The Exorcist. Paranormal Activity is simply a terrifying ghost story stripped down to its bare bones.<br /><br />It may not be the scariest movie ever, but it comes damned close.tified as being capable of helping...it is tantalizingly out of reach.

B0013816GK|5.0|For all the fine performances of the Verdi 'Manzoni Requiem' this 1989 recording with Carlo Maria Giulini conducting the Berlin Philharmonic, the Ernst-Senff-Chorus and the perfect quartet of American soloists - Sharon Sweet, soprano, Florence Quivar, mezzo-soprano, Vinson Cole, tenor, and Simon Estes, bass - is for this listener the finest.  Few conductors can match the sense of hallowed greatness of this work that many feel is Verdi's greatest 'opera'. In this performance he captures all the drama, the terror of the final day of judgment, the antiphonal brass effects that come through well in this superb sonic display, and at the same time he is able to offer the most tender moments of the work with a hushed reverence that calls for a unified approach from all of his resources.<br /><br />To say that the Berlin Philharmonic plays well for him is too obvious; that the chorus rises to the broad spectrum of dynamics with complete commitment is likewise not surprising.  What is a revelation here is the manner in which Giulini worked with each of the soloists to mold his uncanny interpretation.  Sharon Sweet has the power for the declamatory passages as well as the gentle pianissimos of her exposed solos. Florence Quivar's voice seems to have no breaks at all between the high and low ranges of her demanding role; her voice is pure gold.  Vinson Cole may seem an odd choice for a Verdi work, but here he makes the tenor solos and participation in the quartet clarion clear with a voice that never feels strained or less than beautiful. Simon Estes is a true bass who is able to utter the haunting 'Mors stupebit' in a manner that makes all other basses seem superficial in their delivery.<br /><br />The recorded sound is rich and immediate; perhaps choosing to record the work in the Jesus-Christus-Kirche in Berlin adds to the sonic splendor that makes the Requiem seem even more credible a work.  This is a recording that deserves all prizes it has won and should be part of the library of every music lover.  It is definitive!  Grady Harp, November 09library of every music lover.

B000068CNX|5.0|In being an avid fan of the Ross and Rachel characters, I love how Season 2 finally brings them together. In my opinion, they're one of the most indelible TV couples ever. In addition to them, this season really brought out even more of the unique humour that made \\"Friends\\" such an amazing show. The cast had the kind of chemistry that cannot be forced or \\"directed.\\" They just...clicked. And on a side note, this season truly emphasized how talented Jennifer Aniaton is as both a comedic and dramatic actress. It also proved, irrefutably, how incredibly beautiful she is. She should have won an Emmy for this go around. Not only that, her hair was so lovely in this season:)  All in all, an amazing show!
0451530926|5.0|I don't know why it has taken me so long to decide to read this book, it is very easy to read and a very good story. I saw the TV mini-series years ago with Alan Bates in the leading role and all the way through the book I imagined Alan Bates as Michael Henchard. It was Alan Bates speaking Michael's lines. That did not put me off in the least since I was always a fan of Alan Bates and he was very well cast in the part.<br /><br />The story, as most people probably know, starts off about a drunkard who sells his wife and daughter at a country fair to a sailor for five guineas. He then, when sobered up, becomes full of remorse and vows in the nearest church never to touch a drop of alcohol for as long as he has been alive, (21yrs). He keeps his promise, works hard and makes good in the town of Casterbridge, becoming a very rich merchant, land owner and mayor. Of course as time goes by his past catches up with him and a large part of the story is about his subsequent downfall. We see this so often in politics today, how many mayors do we know or have heard of, who have ended up in jail? The difference, refreshingly, is that Michael Henchard in that day and age is truly wretched for his misdeeds, and one can't help but feel sympathy for him in the end. His last will and testimony says everything:-<br /><br />Michael Henchard's Will.<br /><br />That Elizabeth Jane Farfrae be not told of my death,<br />or made to grieve on account of me.<br />& that I be not bury'd in consecrated ground.<br />& that no sexton be asked to toll the bell.<br />& that nobody is wished to see my dead body.<br />& that no murners walk behind me at my funeral.<br />& that no flours be planted on my grave.<br />& that no man remember me.<br />To this I put my name<br /><br />Michael Henchard.<br /><br />This is a good book to take on vacation with you. It is not depressing, (although his Will sounds depressing). Michael Henchard is a spirited unusual character that Thomas Hardy develops to the full. Even though he has done bad things one cheers him on at times and feels that he more than pays his dues for his transgressions.<br /><br />A very good story.eels that he more than pays his dues for his transgressions.

1567184855|3.0|I bought this book because I have become interested in NDE's. This writer touched on the subject but I did not find his interviews all that convincing. I have always believed, and still do believe that conciousness is God and that we become aware of this at death, hence the NDE. I do not think we are taken into a familiar room and given a lecture by our guides at death. Obviously, can't prove it but most of the narration appears to come from the imagination of the interviewee. Doesn't ring true.

B0024RIMBG|4.0|The PBS special, that I originally saw this concert on, had \\"Orinoco Flow\\" as the 4th track, but it's not here. More than that, the disc pauses in the place where the chapter should be. Unlike the other reviewer, when I ordered the DVD the track list had been updated and did not include \\"Orinoco Flow\\"; however, I didn't notice. I just assumed this DVD had the full concert. Needless to say I was very disappointed.<br /><br />This is the only reason I'm giving 4 stars. Otherwise it's a solid 5.<br /><br />One odd thing I noticed is the DVD itself and its sleeve shows a copyright year of 2009! The concert was performed in 2006 with the DVD released in 2007. I don't know if this means it's simply been reissued (as with alot of DVDs) or if there's an older disc out there with the track on it.<br /><br />UPDATE: I said the track list had been updated and \\"Orinoco Flow\\" was not included but as it turns out there are two listings for this DVD. One has the correct info and the other does not.

I am loving each and everyone of these songs and hope that the movie meets the same standards that we're seeing with these soundtracks.
B00130VASW|4.0|At first I did not think I was going to enjoy this album. I really liked Frances the Mute, and I came to TMV through the perspective of a prog rocker. Bedlam seemed at first listen to be a bit to simplistic and punk for my taste. However, after a few weeks and a number of listens, there is a tremendous amount of nuance hidden behind all the cacophony. The album reminds me of Cassandra Gemini, and (despite what a lot of other reviews here and elsewhere suggest) of the heavier portions of early Rush. In particular, the mid-song changes in structure and the guitar phrasing and note choice remind me of songs like Cygnus X-1, The Necromancer, Fountains of Lamneth, and Natural Science.    Standout tracks for me are (2) Metatron, (3) Ilyena, and (4) Wax Simulacra. They seem extremely well crafted and are not too repetitive or \\"hooky\\". Actually, Wax Simulacra is kinda \\"hooky\\" but it doesn't drag on forever, whereas I feel that (1) Aberinkula repeats the chorus too often without much song development inbetween, and is too long for its own good. For me, the remainder of the songs, while enjoyable, are not memorable. But maybe I need to give it more time. The album starts out pedal-to-the-metal and doesn't let up, so it could take a while to really digest the whole thing.    Would I buy it again? Absolutely!     As an aside, while I tend not to lend any credence to the opinion of the pop music community, I believe I read somewhere that Wax Simulacra won a Grammy for best hard-rock performance.

B001KVZ6FW|5.0|A wonderful movie for all the family.  The story has something for everyone, comedy, adventure, deep emotional sense, and beautiful Pixar animation.<br /><br />Ed Asner is the perfect voice for the 78 year old balloon Salesman, Carl Fredricksen. Carl is the main character.<br /><br />The first part of the movie is fresh and moving as the the young Carl's life is told through what seems like an album of photos with the final pictures of his wife passing away.  But now we see him as an old curmudgeon thinking he will hold on to the home he and Ellie shared.  Progress is outside his door; buildings are built around him and his home is condemned.<br /><br />At this point, a young boy, Russell, (cute, tubby, Wilderness Explorer) comes into Carl's life.  He knocks at Carl's door and Russell opens many doors for Carl with his optimism and bold ideas.  Russell needs to get a task of helping the elderly done for an award.  The story becomes fun and crazy as Carl, Russell and the house take off with thousands of helium balloons carrying the load.<br /><br />The winds blow the balloon hefted home to South America where many adventures and challenges face the strange pair.  You can't help but laugh at the crazy characters and cheer when Carl at age 78, finally lives his dream.  Russell is a hoot throughout - all I can say it is a fantastic fun ride as well as deeply moving.

B002JM1VJG|1.0|I have read the reviews for this at all the major Amazon sites;  WEA, WMG, Warner Bro/WB International should be SHAMED into doing the right thing  this 'tribute' is nothing but a cynical insult to both Madonna AND her fans and nothing more a way to take your money  'a bailout' for WARNER  I am going to see if I can get AMAZON.all to add this info to their generally glowing or neutral product comments    WORLDWIDE (using Bablefish) I find reviews on the CELEBRATION VIDEO are generally 4 out of 5 stars, but are weighted VERY heavy-far more than should be- in the 3,2 and especailly *1* star range set, where if it had been done right, a 99% 4 and 5 star rated set:    1. the 2 discs are single layer everywhere, where dual layer would be just barely enough room if they were HQ= poor PQ =CHEAP RIPOFF!  2. the discs are R0 NTSC world wide-this really riles the Europeans as they are used to R2 PAL which is a much sharper picture =CHEAP RIPOFF!  3. The discs are censored for nudity, even in viva la France, for gods sake! CHEAP RIPOFF!  4. PQ is generally lacking despite claims, the videos are not remastered and have not been upgraded and reformatted for WS, HD, and even videos shot in 16:9 are NOT anamorphically enhanced prehistoric, CHEAP RIPOFF       I do not know if Madonna shot any vids in HD-but it appears it would be irrelevant to WARNER BROS anyway, VHS type color bleed is complained about       The ancient 4:3 videos are all left in 4:3/1.33 mode for the 19th century square/tube televisions, when they should have been upconverted or improved and matted for WS televisions-not to even bring up HD  5. The sound quality is poor-some have noted 'psuedo 5.1' CHEAP RIPOFF!  6. Apparently WB were too cheap to put out a BR version-probably for the best as they know mobs of angry 1080p fans with 40 inch screens would march upon and burn WB HQ to the ground-as the sick job they did would become even            MORE evident onscreen    NB: Apparently there is a one disc versionin Japan-im sure it is no better    So instead of giving MADONNA a 21 gun salute farewell-as she has made them BILLIONS OF DOLLARS-they give her a one squirt water pistol salute  It would have been less expensive for them and more honest to just say \\"Eff-you Madonna-dont let the door hi yer ass on the way out of Warner HQ\\"  And \\"Hmm.........yeah-we can still bilk her fans out of millions of dollars by doing the bare minimum in effort in a send off package!\\"  Also, to save a buck, all discs for all territories worldwide where made by WMME in Germany (Warner Music Manufacturing Europe)  These discs take home video back to the prehistoric era-and where not crafted for HD or BR in any way shape or form-in other words  not looking at 2010 and beyond they chose pre 2000 VHS quality    I am not really much of a MADONNA fan at all-but when i heard of this I knew it was wrong because of the greed factor  MADONNA is an icon in music history, is likely a decent if shrewd person and an amazing artist. More to the point  She has made Warner Bros BILLIONS-maybe trillions of dollars;  What a shiitty way for WMG to say \\"Thank you for all your years here at WB-Maddy\\"

Trans max warp whatever teleporters in the next new movie that can be used to jump from one planet to the other side of the Universe thereby negating the reason to move around in all those bright shiny heaps of metal? Never heard of it!    Matter munching big red jaw breakers? What's that..? Can't hear.. you~ la~ la-la- laa~ laaaaa~ not looking at you... ooh pretty flowers......    Star Trek just rubs me in so many bad ways as a ardent reader of Written Science Fiction. The ideas thrown around usually in any star trek show has me asking why didn't they just teleport a fricking bunch of Bombs thru-out the Entire ship of the aliens? They could teleport two dude into it (wait a sec, doesn't it have shields that prevent that?- never mind. It's star trek)... Even if the federation is a bunch of tree hugging hippies, they could still teleport bombs into the engine and drill bit right? Where was that \\"logical\\" alien dude on the good guys ship gonna think out of his pants and get the clue?    Don't get me started on that \\"car chase\\". A simple EMP burst would've killed the engine and no trips into a gorge for little timmy. boo fricking hoo. SPACE VECHICLES being built on the bottom of a GRAVITY WELL? Shucks, what was I a tinking.. it'sa star trekky~          Ugh.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I have had the chance to review this album and can't say enough great things to others about it!!

I will forever be a fan!
B001FB55I0|1.0|You put a director who doesn't know how to handle the mythology correctly and allows the primary actor to direct from behind his back. His even mentioned that there was over FORTY minutes cut from the movie!     I find it hilarious that the \\"Director's Cut\\" only adds in a pathetic THREE minutes into the movie, what happened to the other Thirty-Seven minutes? You know why its a \\"R\\" rated release now? Inside those three minutes, you will see a actors.. wait for it... Breast!    Instant Rate R!.....    I didn't like it when I watched it in the theaters. Something there that seemed to nag at me when I walked out at the ending, and I certainly don't like it even more when I found out what was happening behind the scenes to bloat this movie into the 200 Million dollar turkey it turned into! James Cameron spent close to 120 million ('80s/'90s bucks!) to make T2 -which was an Rated R movie no less!- and made a summer blockbuster. Mgee-whiz dumped something equivalent and laid a rotten egg because he couldn't control an actor.    Typical hollyweird in action.
B0012GN2I8|5.0|It is from this album that I actually coined a whole definition for a certain kind of music from the 70's,inspired by the title of a particularly funky song on this...particularly funky album. Herbie was on this huge musical winning streak in the mid 70's and,even so this album really stands out very strong even for this period in his career! One of main reasons is the addition of Ray Parker Jr who,much as the Brothers Johnson had on the previous album [[ASIN:B00000255O Man-Child]] had really gone above and beyond in his ability to enhance and add great flavors to the already well established Headhunters sound. Not only is this one of Herbie's most funky albums albums of this period but also his most thouroughly ear catching and....pretty melodic since [[ASIN:B000002AGP Head Hunters]] and it's also the most similar one they made to it. All their music from this period was that way but the previous two albums had gone after some more expirmental type sounds. This one not only gets back to the basics but adapts on the sound in all kinds of different ways. In every measurable sense this is a funk album through and through but not every song is alike.<br /><br />  \\"Doin' It\\" is.....well I'd say it was the best tune here but every one is so excellent that's hard to say but it's certainly one of the very strongest jams of 1976,a year full of 'em. The song starts from this Ray Parker riff that....builds into another riff until Herbie's keyboards and synthesizers kick and and build on top of them unti Ray starts singing \\"just keep on doing it!\\". This is a pointed reminder of the building nature of funk in it's heyday. His remake of his own \\"Cantaloupe Island\\" adds a this afro-caribbean stomp,along with kind of this marching \\"big four\\" jazz beat to the funk and gives the tune some extra added bounce. \\"Spider\\" is just an amazing song;like the theme song to a kind of \\"techno-blacksploitation\\" movie never made with it's bassy synth fanfare and that heavy chase scene rhythm. \\"Gentle Thoughts\\" is probably the most commercial sounding groove here as it sticks closest to the melody and sound fairly light for this type of album.<br /><br />  As for it's overall atmospherics...well lets just say it's most fittin that Lee Ritenour actually used this song as the title cut for his next album [[ASIN:B000056693 Gentle Thoughts]]. \\"Swamp Rat\\" is...among one of the most harmonically advanced tunes Herbie ever made with yet more fanfaring bass synths and,as for the second half of the song Paul Jackson's bass and Bennie Maupin's passionate work on sax and reeds carry that area. As for Maupin he gets a big kudos on his own \\"Sansho Shima\\" at the end of the album,which has this very strong afro cuban jazz flavor with the inprovisation being baught to the forefront and the funk kind of riding along in the middle. This album is kind of ignored because it's sandwiched after some well known classics and comes right before his disco-funk period-itself HIGHLY underrated. There is a progression from one to the other yet in terms of Herbie's powers as a soloist,bandleader and composer in the 70's,nevermind his funkiness this album is one of many that can't be beat!that heavy chase scene rhythm. \\"Gentle Thoughts\\" is probably the most commercial sounding groove here as it sticks closest to the melody and sound fairly light for this type of album.

B000002BQK|4.0|Okay even I have to ask:why am I reviewing a Mariah Carey album?And most of all whydid I give it four stars? Well not that I think she's the very worst thing in music by ANY MEANS but Mariah Carey is not one of my favorite artists to put it mildly. And it's sure not for any lack of trying. It seems that each time I tried to get into her I only enjoyed PART of something she did but,that it always came out realy flat and dull in the end. At the same time,there was a HUGE chunk of her album [[ASIN:B000BO0LKY The Emancipation of Mimi]] that I really liked and so far that is THE only Mariah Carey album I reviewed. Now compared with a lot of other artists even Mariah's best albums probably don't really stack up. There are reasons for that I'll explain later in the review but this is not an overall review of Mariah herself;this is about her fifth album from 1997. I remember when this came out,I ignored it then and never gave it a second chance. Same went when I was purchasing CD's at a local discount place today when they said it was a buy 2 get 2 free deal. I was short one and kept passing this without a thought. Some rambuncious kid knocked it down and I noticed it had a cover of the Prince song \\"The Beautiful Ones\\".Out of curiousity I said \\"okay:I'll take a chance but I'm going to like it\\" to myself and listened to it,as I often do music as I painted. I was a bit surprised considering I heard (and do not own) her [[ASIN:B0000028VT Music Box]] and didn't much care for that one at all. This album,considering the source is not halfway bad. The music is a fairly emotionally potent collection of lightly funk hip-hop/R&B tracks and somewhat big if reasonable ballads. \\"Honey\\" is'nt too bad a song at all;it is definately not hard core but the breezy groove with some nice Sade-like overtones (especially in the bass line) is actually genuinely sensual in a way. The title song is really good too and very much in the same league. Strangely enough there's also a reminder to me of why I find Mariah so irritating sometimes. It's not always her production or music-IT'S HER! She's made a career out of herself as one of those \\"she's a good singer\\" types,relying strongly on her multi octave range. But she also breathlessly stays in that same higher end of her voice pretty much all the time-only ever dipping into her pretty powerful deeper range on occasion. She probably believes she's making a lot of use of her vocal gifts but not only does it sound very gimmicky but,she actually gets horse from it on a number of tunes here. \\"My All\\",\\"Babydoll\\" and \\"Outside\\" represent what the majority of this album consists of:stripped down (for Mariah) urban ballads that only occasionally escape her customary over produced fluttering with something that sounds like she has more confidence. The 90's disco styled \\"Fly Away\\" is a good change of pace as it relys more on the full spectrum of her voice and her handling something more uptempo and adult. \\"The Roof\\" and \\"Breakdown\\" both again go for something closer to funk again. It doesn't work entirely but,since at least producer Sean Combs knew what funk was he was able to squeeze as much as he could from the lightness of Mariah's overall sound. As for \\"The Beatiful Ones\\",the reason I went here it's musically more a re-make than a cover as it doesn't abtract at all from the sound of the original. But it's the duet format with Dru Hill,who takes most the leads here that really bring the song out. I don't usually say this but,by virtue of the producer and song choice this is one of those albums I rate higher from everything about it BUT the main artist involved. This might be a fairly weak album for some artists but it's good for Mariah and that isn't saying much. Many of us agree she has trouble living up to her potential and it puts her on so many peoples \\"least favorite artist\\" lists. But honestly this would not have been a bad place for Mariah to begin a more musically productive second career. Sadly as she seems tobe seeking fame and fortune over integrity this and [[ASIN:B000BO0LKY The Emancipation of Mimi]] will have to count for now as her two strongest albums and,again that just doesn't say enough for someone who has the ability and drive to reach beyond her comfort zone.career.

0385504225|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the read.  I enjoyed the pacing, the detailed information of science and history, art and geography, and the overall story and theme.  I don't normally write reviews, but felt compelled to simply comment on one thing.  There is a passage that states that some are creators and some are destroyers.  That can always be seen in reviews on sites such as this where too many people feel the need to expound upon their pretentious opinions.  Everyone has an opinion and a great thing about art, books, and movies is that they spark thought and emotion in the people that view them.  They cause us to think, be moved, and even inspire.  Some are simply there to entertain.  Just remember, it's much easier to be a destroyer and go around tearing down another's hard work than to be a creator and add something of your own to society.  Enjoy things for what they are, and don't take entertainment so seriously.
B001GQACGO|5.0|As long as I've known about her Beyonce has always struck me as someone with a complete duel nature. On the one end reflective and creative and,on the other mildly shallow and attention craving. Well now she is physically mature and knows that all too well. This is a double album,at a time when NO MAJOR R&B star is making them anymore and as such it reflects her apparent split personality. She had a promising career with Destiny's Child and her solo career got off to an excellent start. To be honest though,upon further listenings I found the majority of [[ASIN:B000H0MKGA B'day]] lacking for the sheer quality of song:not atypical of the pop music scene in general circa 2005-2006. Now she's definately going all out on this one not to seek attention,but rather credibility. After a long period of being told she has much potential it seems that here she is beginning to fulfill it. Now this is not some kind of Stevie Wonder 70's masterpiece or anything. Nor is it.....[[ASIN:B00005LMJU Aaliyah]];the contemporary R&B/pop scene just doesn't allow that variety or thrill in innovation. One thing that's positive about this album is that all of it heavily plays down Beyonce's past clishe's of oversinging as well as laying on those gimmicky,electronic microtonal Arabic-styled arrangments so heavily. The first disk of the albums consists of midtempo and slow jams that actually do innovate in one respect:they take some of the modern drum machine oriented R&B and blend them with these kind of alternative folk-rock flavor. \\"Smash Into You\\" and \\"Satellites\\" are two of the best examples of this kind of brooding acoustically textured R&B (not acoustic soul as it has a lot more of an edge) and finds Beyonce's writing and singing at a premium. Whatever you might think of her overexposure these are terrific tunes. \\"If I Were A Boy\\" puts her in the possition many male soulsters did in the past:seeing the battle of the sexes from,in this case a mans point of view-stating that she'd \\"understand how to be a girl\\". Considering how things are now she's probably not entirely correct but is definately onto something there. \\"Halo\\" and \\"Broken Hearted Girl\\" are great likeminded songs,beautifully chorded although in the end some rhythmic variation would've baught them as close to perfection as any human could ask. Still they are very good. Her take on \\"Ave Maria\\" is really nice with this mix of R&B and opera that......could've been very pretentious but Beyonce's belief in the concept doesn't put it too far over the top. That alone would've been an excellent album. The second CD is all uptempo and,while it projects a similar variety in many ways it doesn't variate from Beyonce's previous sound as the first disk does. Some of that might have to do with the fact that \\"Diva\\" is by far the most unpleasant song on the whole album with her seriously stating \\"a diva's a female version of a hustler\\". The almost meglomaniacal ego tripping would've easily deducted two or more stars for me if it was'nt for another song,the great horn packed soul/funk of \\"Ego\\" where she literally sings of having a really big ego and,while also stating to be able to back it up she has at least part of her tongue planted in her cheek. \\"Video Phone\\" isn't a bad song but her \\"this is not R&B\\" kind of attitude does remind me of the troubling musical self denial I've always seen in Beyonce but there's also irony. In the meantime \\"Hello\\" and \\"Radio\\" are good keyed up dance tracks that too present some strong rhythmic,if very digitized rhythmic variations and some incredible songwriting in places. \\"Scared And Lonley\\" is a great closer that mixes it all up:the midtempo,the electronic rhythms and even that folk-rock touch. On this album Beyonce puts all her musical and lyrical assets and wharts on display and even expressess some understanding of her need to get over some of the latter. If her future means that she will take this concept to heart and concentrate on her musical vision over attention seeking she will be in a pretty good place. That remains to be seen but,for an album I was sure I'd totally dislike this is very potent in many areas and worth the time for those looking for redeption in contemporary R&B.r musical vision over attention seeking she will be in a pretty good place.

0066620996|3.0|RECAP<br /><br />Good to Great, by Jim Collins, is based on 5 years of research that tries to explain \\"why some companies make the leap...and others don't.\\" The research involved selecting over 1400 companies that made the Fortune 500 from 1965 to 1995. Through a series of 5 cuts, the research team whittled the field down to 11 companies that were categorized as good to great along with a group of direct comparison companies. The book presents 5 key findings, including:<br /><br />* The presence of what Collins termed \\"Level 5 Leaders\\"<br />* A deep understanding of purpose and simplicity termed the \\"Hedgehog Concept\\"<br />* A culture of discipline<br />* The role of technology as an accelerator<br />* Consistent effort to produce results as opposed to big breakthroughs or radical change<br /><br />Lastly, Collins related the findings from the book to findings in his book, Built to Last, which was published a couple years later. Collins stated that findings from Good to Great enabled the ideas in Built to Last and pointed to a connection between BHAGs (Big Hairy Audacious Goals) and the Hedgehog Concept. He stated that a BHAG is a key way to stimulate progress while preserving the core, which provides a unifying focal point of effort and framed by specific understandings. Essentially, a BHAG lies at the core of the 3 elements of the Hedgehog Concept.<br /><br />PROFESSIONAL VALUE<br />In terms of the value I would place on the findings from this book, I would say that there are definitely useful points. However, most of those key findings seem most applicable to CEOs and to a lesser extent CMOs.

B00000K31Q|5.0|My teenaged daughter's all time favorite movie.  She got it as a gift 4 years ago and she and her friends loved it so much that the friends borrowed it -- but it never made its way back to my daughter.

Even her male friends like it.
B001I8A76A|5.0|This album blew me away, being someone who'd never purchased a Pink album previously. I see there are many good & at-length reviews here, so I will add only the few cents that I didn't see elsewhere.<br /><br />The true revelation for me with this album is that Pink is a ballad girl, not just the poppy/fun/edgy singer you hear on the radio. Guttural, painful, honest, a streaming consciousness of pain, disappointment & sadness at some points. From \\"Sober,\\" to \\"One foot wrong,\\" I was amazed at Pink's powerful emotion delivered with such an uncanny Pat Benatar vibe.  But not only can she deliver these rough & raw songs, she can switch it up on you and toss you something heart felt and tear inducing like \\"Glitter in the air\\" . Amazing. Definitely an interesting album that has quite a variety but for me, enough strong emotion that it didn't feel disparate. It felt exactly what someone goes through, a mix of emotions, all piled together on this album.
B001EAWMGA|5.0|Don't listen to that Tom Keogh DeWalt-type.  Seriously, how could he have been bored by this?  Complicated?  This movie was easy to get, what's his problem?!    Admidetly, I came into this with low expectations as I never even heard of Outlander when it blinked through its theatrical run.  Being the sci-fi nerd that I am, I was intrigued by the description on the back of the DVD box.  Several months passed until I finally gave it a spin on Amazon In Demand.  I am glad I did.  This movie has it all; great pacing, solid cast, good story, cool creature design!  The CGI was a bit subpar in some of the flashback sequences, but not enough to be distracting.  I would compare this movie to another underated gem by the name of Pitch Black.  Sure, the sci-fi nerds are going to appreciate it, but hey... My wife liked it and she rolls her eyes whenever I suggest watching movies of this type.    Do yourself a favor and ignore the snob, haters posing as legitimate movie critics.  This movie is awesome!

She gives many examples of what not to do: \\"here's what I don't want you to do\\" and \\"you can't do this.\\"  When I'm trying to keep my energy up and stay motivated, these negatives day after day become a drag.  In the second workout she makes a weird comment about not quitting so you can look good in jeans or a bathing suit--that's really not why I am working out and getting healthy.  I really do like the first workout and so what I do is play the video on mute and then put on my own music.
B002Q8GZ62|3.0|Spandau Ballet's first \\"album\\" in twenty years is a disappointing reworking of eleven of their best loved songs and two new tracks. The problem isn't so much the wonderful source material as the indifferent treatment it's given here. The arrangements and production are simply uninteresting with their consistently bland combination of acoustic guitars, keyboards, strings and Steve Norman's occasional sax. Gary Kemp argues it brings the band's sound into the 21st century and shows how they would've done these songs originally if they'd had the maturity and know-how back then. I think it rather undoes their magic. Teaming up with Danton Supple probably seemed like an excellent idea, but if they wanted to refresh the back catalogue the band might've been better off handing over the original material to a range of mixers, producers and guest artists who could've spun something more engaging from it all. (Surely \\"Chant No.1\\" could've made a good dance track a second time around? Have a listen to what people have done with some Peter Gabriel classics over at realworldremixed.) The almost-soaring title track and single, \\"Once More\\", walks a clever lyrical line between the repair of a romantic relationship and the reunion of the band - but then lines like \\"I always loved you, but I didn't know\\" can suddenly make it feel a little creepy. Both it and the Tony Hadley-penned \\"Love Is All\\" are unlikely to build a new fan base, but they certainly do sound of-their-time: they're so resolutely MOR-inoffensive that they could well have been plucked from the Idol Winner's Single list. As one of my friends said, \\"It sounds like Robbie Williams' father has released a song.\\" Still, Hadley's voice is as good as ever and I can only hope the much deserved success of the tour sparks the band's creativity and encourages them back into the studio to make a real album next time. As a shameless fan of everything they did in the 1980s, I want more!
0385504225|3.0|The previous books by Dan Brown had a more provocative tone. In this one everyone is nice and means well (expect for 1 character 100% evil). For me it lost the edge and is trying to please everyone.   Still it is a good read, the plot moves fast. Unfortunately I guessed the end in the beginning of the book, and I don't even know Washington DC that well.
0307454541|5.0|Can't say much that hasn't already been said by nearly 600 other reviewers other than this is certainly one of the best mystery stories that I have read in several years.  Literally two excellent tales in one.  Reading \\"The Girl with Dragon Tattoo\\" ensures that you will read anything that the late and lamented Stieg Larsson has written.  His death was a great loss to mystery writing.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|I saw this movie as a child and it has remained in my memory ever since. When I saw it advertised on Amazon.com I knew I had to see it again. I am seventy three years old now and I enjoyed it as much as I did when I was a child. Your children and grandchildren will love it. It's a keepsake to be cherished. Hazel

B0013IKUIK|5.0|When I first heard the song Re:Stacks on House MD, my brother and I both cried. I was a fitting song for Wilson and Amber. When I finally found the song title, I became curoious and bought the whole album. The best stuff to put you to sleep at night. A way to end the evening on a good note!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0452289963|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  As I read various comments, I see that many get from this book what they are ready to understand.  The fundamentalists go crazy, because this book shows how ego based their thinking is.  No matter what background you have, a New Earth points the way to a greater understanding of our lives, our time on Earth, and what we can do on a day by day basis to create heaven on earth.  I highly reccommend this book for all seekers of a higher truth.
B000VE439Y|5.0|Three wise men wend their way to a small hut in a small town, 2000 years ago. They are in search of the Messiah and they come bearing gifts...but first they make a small mistake and deliver them to He who is not the Savior, Brian, who happens to be born on the same day, just down the alley from that Jesus fella.  Brian grows up a fairly oblivious and apolitical mama's boy, though sadly with less interest in stonings than is proper.  Alas, events lead him to work with the People's Front of Judea, the attempted kidnap of Pilate's wife, accidental prophet-hood, and eventual crucifixion to the tune of \\"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.\\"<br /><br />The conventional wisdom on LIFE OF BRIAN is that it's the Python crew's most \\"polished\\" or \\"competent\\" film as a team, and I'd probably agree with that, though I find HOLY GRAIL funnier.  It's still scattershot and somewhat inconsistent of course - I for one found the whole Pilate/Biggus Dickus thing a bit overlong, and the alien abduction while fun doesn't really add anything besides giving Terry Gilliam more to do - but it does actually feel like a moderately cohesive film, and of course it takes the typical Python over-the-top methods on attacking organized religion to a point which all but the most humor-challenged Christians ought to be able to admit to at least chuckling over - it's a bit more pointed and narrow in its humor.  Of course, the film isn't really anti-Christian, or anti-Jewish, but rather anti-stupid. Maybe that was its biggest problem with some audiences....<br /><br />Early highlights include the stoning scene and the scene with the ex-leper, but where the film really takes off in my mind is when Brian becomes an accidental prophet.  It seems to be channeling or ripping off HOLY GRAIL at first - smart, articulate Brian being completely misunderstood by the idiot peasants, just exactly as Bedevere in the earlier film presiding over the witch's trial - but the brilliance with which Brian quickly goes from being just another hairy crazed prophet (reminiscent naturally of street-corner shouters even today) to being followed all around by a witless mob is startling and hard for me to describe.  I think this may be the apex of the Pythons' wordplay, and the fact that it's foreshadowed in an early scene where Brian and others are listening to the real Messiah but misinterpreting his words wildly only adds an icing to the cake. If there's a message to LIFE OF BRIAN it's that people will hear what they want to hear, and sometimes no matter how clear you think you're being, you're not going to get through to them - especially if God's in the way.<br /><br />I find comedy harder to describe or critique than just about anything else; perhaps that's a copout but I'm not sure how I can really get at just how clever and funny the film is without quoting a bunch of dialogue, and what's the point in that? You're here on IMDb, you can check it out easily yourselves.  I will close by saying that in one way LIFE OF BRIAN does seem to \\"conform\\" to the more modern style of religious \\"epic\\" - the Jerusalem and the Jews here are dirty, disheveled, and poor. Gone pretty much for good by this time is the splendor of the 50s and 60s Cinemascope epics - although I suspect that may have as much do with the small budgets of the Pythons' film, and Scorsese's and Gibson's later, serious efforts at the Christ story, as with any conscious desire to make things grubby.<br /><br />Note on the disc - the transfer is excellent, and you can't beat this (or most editions of Python films, really) for extras; I've only scratched the surface of the two commentaries, the documentary, etc, and haven't even touched the cast reading.another hairy crazed prophet (reminiscent naturally of street-corner shouters even today) to being followed all around by a witless mob is startling and hard for me to describe.

B0009WFFS6|5.0|I caught this on a PBS fundraiser and was blown away by it.  Had to have it.   Could have gone down to local bookstore but got it on Amazon for 1/2 the priece, and in new condition.   Received in great condition.     As for the recording, if you are a Cream fan, or appreciate Clapton, then you will want this.   If you compare this with thier farewell tour in Central Park you will note that the Reunion concert at Royal Albert Hall lacks some of the fire and energy from the farewell tour. But what it lacks in energy, very minimally, it more than makes up for in improved musicianship.  The fact that they could get back together after so long and pull this concert off so well is a tribute to their talent and musicianship.  But Clapton is clearly the most improved and offers up some of his better performances, I believe, of his career.  I wondered just how good this performance would be and I was pleasantly surprised.   Certainly, not over the top but worth viewing and worth owning.  I have watched it 5 or 6 times and enjoyed it each run through. It keeps getting better as the performance goes on.   One exception is that Clapton does not do his remarkable wah wah pedal work on White Room.  The original is benchmark stuff for all guitarists and for the guitarists in the crowd that is a little bit of a let down, but Clapton more than makes up for that with some incredible new interpretations of the original work without destroying the flow of the original.  He just keeps getting  better.   Unfortunately, the volatility that exists between Baker and Bruce has not diminished and virtually threatened the performance from happening in the first place.  But that probably fueled part of the energy as they did enjoy being back together after so long.   From a pure enjoyment standpoint, I loved this concert.  I would say that this is a must have for any Clapton, Cream, or classic Sixties rock fan.
B0029O08WA|4.0|I really love this sound track I reread new moom with the sound track playing...
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I have to say that I am very satisfied with this product.  It delivers very clear sound and being able to hear your friends and the game clearly is very good.  You can and will hear everything, you can hear someone sneaking up behind you when you wouldn't be able to without this headset.  Now I am going to tell the only drawback, there is a hissing which I was able to get over in about 5 seconds.  Trust me as soon as the game starts you will never notice it because it is a very minor hiss.  Overall this is a good product for anyone looking to by a headset.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|What does The Lost Symbol and the Princess Bride what do they have in common?<br /><br />Robert Langdon the protoganist in the Lost Symbol and Vizzini the criminal genius in the Princess Bride find every situation they are in \\"inconceivable\\" at this point Robert Langdon has stared in other Brown books and yet he find himself completed \\"perplexed\\" to be in his current predicament. Gimme a break. No plot spoilers but if you start to get an inkling of how the book is going to end (and I did by page 200) you pretty much can skip the rest of the book. No surprises No aha moments just a relentless plodding towards the inevitable that Dan Brown stretches because his publisher and editor would not dare shorten the work of their golden calf.<br /><br />The only bright spot in this book is the field of Noetics and you can wiki that for free.<br /><br />As for Dan Brown please go back to writing entertaining books and leave the vanity of trying to create a movement to another svengali guru.

B002L3RVCY|5.0|I watched this DVD pack, the DVD animated movie, the original 2001 Episode 2 movie and anything in between to get all I could about the Clone Wars! To think all this started when Sir Alec Guinness <spelling-sorry!) said one little sentence mentioning something about \\"yeah, I was a Jedi Knight during the Clone Wars!\\" to a very young Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker! Right where Episode 2 stops, this excellent, high quality computer animated series fills in alot of gaps and information as to who all the major players are, both good and evil! Damn, alright when is Season 2 comin' out! You the Fan/Viewer get a more comprehensive understanding of Anakin Skywalker and how much \\"good\\" and compassion there is in him! LUCASFILMS can go 9 season of this, with a \\"War\\" of this scale, there should be enough material to carry it off! You really get a good sense of commradery with the Clone Troopers, the other Jedi Knights, the dumbass bumbling JJBinks(comedy relief) the sultry/evil asaj ventriss, the mix of the politics, this whole adventure is really well written, the voice actors have their \\"Star\\" counterparts down to a \\"T!\\" I really don't want to watch the movie Episode 3, because alas, all GOOD things come to an end. After watching Season One, YOU don't want Anakin to turn to the Dark Side-EXCELLENT SERIES, sign me up to purchase SeasonTwo when it comes out!
B001OQCV24|1.0|I just got home from seeing this and was extremely disappointed.  What had so much potential ended up being one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my 35 years.<br /><br />\\"Over the top\\" is an understatement.  The writers and director went WAY overboard...and inserted into this film an hour of extra crap that wasn't needed.  The dialogue and connections between the cast were not there...and it was just plain annoying at times interrupting major actions sequences with truly idiotic romantic sequences which totally messed up the pace.<br /><br />I was relieved when it was over, and I laughed (as did other audience members) several times throughout the film.  \\"Are you kidding me\\" was heard in the theatre several times through the 2.5 hour mess called 2012.<br /><br />So much potential, such horrible execution.  The ONLY good things I can say about it are (1) great CGI/special effects (2) it makes you think a little about what matters when the end of the world is upon us and (3) Danny Glover did well.<br /><br />Truly one of the worst directed films I have ever seen, and I've seen many, many movies.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I've been using this for about a year now, and it works great with everything.<br /><br />Fair warning, it may seem odd using it at first, since your hands already have muscle memory for a keyboard, but once you use the G13 enough, it becomes second nature. Setting up the keys and macros is very easy to do, and you will find out, just like a keyboard, that you will prefer certain keys for certain actions and such.<br /><br />I've used it playing a raiding Warlock in WoW, and spell rotations are easy enough to do with it, I've played Diablo 2, Titan Quest, Torchlight, and most recently Dragon Age with it. They all work fantastic.<br /><br />But like I said, it will take some time to get used to it. But once you do, you will be happy you bought it.<br /><br />I love this nerd pad.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|This is a stellar album from start to finish. It's americana at it's best. It covers almost all genres of music. The CD was released on 9-11-01.

Overall part of Dylan's \\"trilogy\\" comeback, along with Time Out Of Mind & Modern times. Great album, a must! His best since 1974's Blood On The Tracks!!        MEZ
B000002NZO|4.0|Trespass - Genesis (3.75 stars)<br />Original Release: 10/23/1970<br /><br />Songs:<br /><br />Looking for Someone (3 stars)<br />Some sinister force or element seems to be personified here in the lyrics to this song.  After the vocal sections there is an aggressive, progressive instrumental section that arises and moves through a number of themes.  A good early example of a truly progressive rock song although this one does not capture my interest as strongly as others on this album.<br /><br />White Mountain (4 stars)<br />Keyboards and guitars effectively introduce us to what I imagine to be a story in an alpine wilderness where the drama of this song story seems to take place.  This perception could in large measure be due to the fact that the wolves about whom the story revolves have almost identical names to two wolves in Jack London's \\"white Fang\\" although this is where the similarities end.  The instrumentation complements the story well.  There is a definite lack of moral interpretation to the events which also keeps the story and the music in an intriguing alien space.  Still connected to my Jack London associations I found the whistling and humming in the coda to this song to introduce a human presence in a tale about animals that seemed emotionally compelling.<br /><br />Visions of Angels (3 stars)<br />The lyrics speak bleakly of dreams and wishes which systematically never come to pass.  The upbeat and hopeful tone of the music comes off as sarcasm in this context.  There is an interesting progressive instrumental section to this song.<br /><br />Stagnation (4 stars)<br />From the album notes for this song:<br /><br />To Thomas S. Eiselberg, a very rich man, who was wise enough to spend all his fortunes in burying himself many miles beneath the ground. As the only surviving member of the human race, he inherited the whole world.<br /><br />Without this intriguing clue I don't think it would be possible to make much sense of the lyric's on this song.  As the song moves in a more-or-less linear fashion through a series of musical themes and the lyrics along with it, there is painted a bizarre picture of a world full of futility and failure although the song's and song's protagonist seems to still find ways to respond to that world with a variety of emotions.  This song requires some imagination to pull it together but I think that it ends up being evocative.  A great example of a thoroughly progressively structured song.<br /><br />Dusk (4 stars)<br />The music is gentle and serene but again the lyrics are coldly despondant.  Nice vocals both solo and group.  The lyricist oscillates between a measured view of lifes destructive energies and seeming despair.  Flute and guitar pick up the energy in the center of the song and fill a gentle instrumental progression.  The final lyrical section takes a stab at God and then declares our final fate:<br /><br />But wait, on the horizon,<br />A new dawn seems to be rising,<br />Never to recall this passerby, born to die.<br /><br />The Knife (3 stars)<br />This song has more aggression in it by far than the rest.  It is also the longest.  The lyrics describe a no holds barred attitude of violent revolution without any effort at moral justification.  Without any clues to reveal a tone of sarcasm, I have to wonder whether the song was meant to show the horror of imposing one's own will without reservation:<br /><br />I'll give you the names of those you must kill,<br />All must die with their children.<br />Carry their heads to the palace of old,<br />Hang them high, let the blood flow.<br /><br />Perhaps the stage performance helped to put this song in context.  Vocal and instrumental passages progress through a connected variety of themes.  Relentlessly militant, this song breaks the mood of the rest of the album somewhat but has much to hold interest.  A very dark and heavy song.<br /><br />Album:<br />Song composition and mood and lyrical content rise well above the standard pop/rock fare.  Excellent song composition with a great variety of musical ideas well connected.  I suspect that already Genesis were the masters of musical transitioning making a song seem to sit well with itself despite its rich assortment of musical themes.  So far there seem to be progressive rock albums that have two different overall emotional outlooks: the hope of Yes and the Moody Blues and the darkness and despair of ELP and King Crimson.  The lyrics of Peter Gabriel are dark indeed and seem to intentionally avoid any kind of apologetics or moralism.  This gives the songs on this album a certain raw strength but it may leave you cold and sometimes disagree with the tone of the instruments.  But mainly these songs seem artfully crafted.  Already Genesis is showing their skill at song composition that made them one of the greatest progressive rock bands.<br /><br />Overall, this album probably would have had a bigger positive impact on me had I heard it first in the context of its time.  As it was I traced my way back to it from the 80's perspective from which my musical interests originated.  I also have the non-re-mastered edition and my opinion of this album might improve (some song ratings that were 3's might become 4's) if I heard a better recording.  The album as a whole is a worthwhile addition to any progressive rock fan's collection.  I've heard Genesis' earlier From Genesis to Revelation and like the Moody Blues' first album I have not bothered to purchase it as its style is much too poppy for my tastes.<br /><br />MP3 recommendation:<br /><br />There isn't too much call to not buy the whole album but here are those songs I gave 4 stars to rather than just 3.<br /><br />4 star songs (4 stars)<br />1.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|Michael Jackson's \\"This is It\\" is an inspiring and magical experience. You really have never seen Michael like this before!  It's as if you're actually there being talked to, experiencing the rehearsals and concerts and everything. It's a totally different Michael than the Michael we hear in our cars on CD's. This Michael is like Michael being himself. You get to see Michael change in his costumes, rehearse the songs, talk to the directors, practice dance moves and you get to see a side of him you never knew was there.   After seeing \\"This is It\\", each time I heard an M.J. song, it wasn't like just dancing to a cool song - it was more like there was something to the song - a meaning, a potential, a heart. Michael was born with a big heart and filled with soul ever since he was a kid and in \\"This is It\\" that shines. Michael's heart shines. His soul shines when he dances and sings and talks and rehearses. It's like Michael is more than just a pop singer - but your friend, your family. Each time Michael spoke, it was like he was speaking to you with as he called it, \\"L.O.V.E.\\" and he's always sweet and kind with every word, every motion, every song, every person and he always adds a touch of Love, Soul, Heart and Fun to each and every one of his songs. If it's slow, fast, or in the middle, Michael shines and gives off something that makes you never think of him the same. Instead, you think of him as your family, someone who will always care about you.   Michael always cared about his fans and directors and producers and everyone he worked with and he always said that and respected them as well as they respected Michael.   Michael from the time he was little had soul, heart and charm and could always sing his heart out, not a key missed or sung wrong. Michael had a gift. His gift was singing and dancing, what Michael does best. Michael is a fabulous dancer as well as singer and that hasn't changed for 50 years.       The worst part was that the earth-known King of Pop was about to have this super great concert -but his sudden death interfered with the planned event. So many people to this day shed a tear or two about Michael's death, but in \\"This is It\\", they aren't as sad because \\"This is It\\" shares a side of Michael the fans have never seen before and when they do, it makes them think a whole different way about M.J.   What can I say? MJ has brought happiness in his music since he was little singing with the Jackson 5. Everyone knows Michael Jackson is a very talented singer - young and old. EVERYONE loves Michael Jackson. Whoever doesn't is a freako. and this movie is for all those major Mikey fans.  I went and saw This is It in the theaters and was dazzled. The whole thing was set out so nicely.   When MJ talked, it was as if he was talking to you and he was so honest and sweet with his workers, not at all mean and snotty like some other stars.   I loved the black and white \\"Smooth Criminal\\" scene and the \\"Thriller\\" scene.   All of this is basically just rehearsal footage of what was going to be the best MJ concert of all time, This is It. The whole time I was watching it, I was thinking, \\"this could've been a killer concert!\\", but all the song rehearsal and different scenes made you feel like you where at the concert, like you where actually there. And Michael is soooo talented. He sings great, dances great and he really shines in this movie.   The two weeks are probably up by now, so for anyone who hasn't seen this is in the theaters, buy this. It's a must-have even if you have already seen it. It's such a great film.    RIP Michael Jackson  WE L.O.V.E YOU FOREVER!!!!!!

B002BSHXJA|5.0|Like many other Beatles fans, I started off by grabbing the complete set of STEREO REMASTERS the day they went on sale in Sept.....Unfortunately, I was unimpressed with several of the stereo mixes....PLEASE PLEASE ME...WITH THE BEATLES...RUBBER SOUL...REVOLVER....Immediately turned me off..That \\"vocals/right-music/left\\" technique just didn't do it for me.  .and after a second listen....I found myself  growing ever more unpleased with SGT PEPPER and MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR...<br /><br />So I ran out and grabbed this selection.....The MONO REMASTERS....and am extremely enthusiastic about my purchase.  I actually prefer the MONO versions of everything up to the WHITE ALBUM...I have mixed emotions about the stereo versus the mono WHITE ALBUM....After several listenings of the MONO version, I find it has a much fuller sound than the stereo.<br /><br />An historical note:  Back in the days before stereo...MONO (or Monaural as it is called) was actually HIGH FIDELITY and was preferred my many audio enthusiasts because of it's exceptional dynamics...Stereo was dismissed as a passing fad and gimmick that took away from the musical performance.<br /><br />The MONO sound quality is fantastic...very smooth highs...and not harsh like the early cd issues...deeper, more natural bass tones....wider dynamic range....You can actually hear alot of detail in the vocals and music now.  The mono mix just has a stronger, fuller sound overall...Another quality is the very consistent sound from cd to cd..<br /><br />As far as the Stereo versions....I would grab .PAST MASTERS...ABBEY ROAD...LET IT BE and LET IT BE NAKED (as the latter 3 aren't available in mono)...and if you pick up a copy of HOLLYWOOD BOWL and the BBC...That would probably pretty well complete your Beatles collection.<br /><br />I guess the hard core Beatles fans will do what I did and just go buy the complete sets of both....as both have their own merits.<br /><br />If your budget is limited..then..most definitely...go MONO
0060254920|5.0|I'm 23 and I've never read the book because it hasn't been released in Bulgaria. I read it the night after I saw Spike Jonez's beautiful film and at first I was somewhat disappointed by its simplicity. Then however I read several articles and interviews and I began to understand how genius and deep this book really is.<br /><br />Both the book and the movie, thought very different, are masterpieces in their own universes!
B0029O08WA|2.0|I adored the Twilight soundtrack, so of course I couldn't wait to listen to the New Moon soundtrack.  But there was no comparison.  The New Moon soundtrack really disappointed me.  There were only about 5 or 6 songs that I liked, and the rest of them all sounded similarly weird and boring.  Quite a few of the songs reeked of talentlessness as well, not going beyond overused power cords and electronic-sounding vocals.  I'm still hoping that it will all come together in the movie, but as of now, I'm not very pleased with the music.
0385532458|4.0|Having lost interest in John Grisham soon after he starting cranking out mediocre legal thrillers, I was pleased to see him return to Clanton, Mississippi, the scene of my favorite Grisham book, A Time to Kill.    For the most part, the stories in Ford County do not disappoint. In fact, I found six of the seven to be great, sort of Faulkner-esqe Southern gothic but of course much easier to read. In rough order of their appeal, \\"Quiet Haven,\\" \\"Casino,\\" \\"Fish Files,\\" \\"Blood Drive,\\" \\"Michael's Room,\\" and \\"Fetching Raymond\\" all grabbed me from the first page and didn't let go.    The one clunker for me was \\"Funny Boy,\\" the story of an AIDS victim and Clanton native who returns home to die. As I was reading it, all I could think was, \\"ok, we are supposed to think people in small-town Mississippi are ignorant, but to be this ignorant about AIDS is just ridiculous.\\" Finally, Grisham explains why -- this story is set in 1989. The other stories in the book could take place today. This one looks, feels, and in fact is, tremendously dated. It really ended the book on a down note for me.    But up till then, it was great. So five stars minus one equals a well-deserved four stars for Ford County. I hope to see more short stories from Grisham.
B001V9LRV0|4.0|I think that Video Quality and Music Quality are excellent, no doubt! Restoration works are made by really professional people.  Package is containing 4 discs with bonus iron plate with 3D woodstock image. It's something that I didn't like since I want product quality rather that box quality. It's funny to see the external BOX Set like an Hippie Jacket Generation, even my opinion is better to avoid it.    Inside the box there are a few reproduction of memorabilia, not really nice from my point of view.    At the end, my opinion is very positive, I suggest to purchase it, not to forget the great event took 40 years ago but still alive in our generation.

0884271536|4.0|Goldratt effectively picks a university's executive MBA program as a backdrop to teach about critical chain.  The story lines are less interesting than what you find in \\"The Goal\\", but the application of TOC (theory of constraints) in a project environment is very well explained.  The class room setting of most of the book is very useful in allowing the students to voice their objections, and for the main character to address where and how to change their thinking, and shed a different light on their experiences.  There are also some interesting exploits into the business world, where the main character becomes a consultant, and demonstrates how to apply the theory in the real world.  This book makes you reconsider how to manage the critical path of a project, by using feeding buffers, and how to actually shorten timelines by removing milestones and managing activities and resources by focusing on completing the project, not the individual tasks.
0307266303|4.0|It is one thing to \\"go for a run.\\" It is still another to log the miles that qualify you as \\"a runner.\\" But, \\"training\\" to run, is a whole other thing entirely. A large part of the appeal of distance running is the simplicity. Lace up your shoes, head to your favorite seaside path, and off you go. No memberships. No mail-order equipment. No training.    So, why would you want to spend any of your running time doing gut-busting sprints or mixing in two days a week of contorting strength training exercises?    Because, if the distance running bug can be like the bite of the gamma-radiated spider that gave Peter Parker his powers, Christopher McDougall's Born to Run explores what gets you sewing the spider suit. And, McDougall can add his own book to the pile of running inspiration. Read it, and I guarantee you'll soon be asking: should I be eating ground corn? Should I be logging MORE miles? Should I be training barefoot? Because who wants to just run, when you could be running faster?    McDougall pieces together a narrative of incredible breadth, as he gives primers on distance running's recent history, its stars, running shoe technology, diet and nutrition, and more, all in the context of a compelling story about a self-exiled loner's quest to organize an ultra-marathon between America's best ultra racers and a Mexican tribe of super runners.     Part homage to distance running, part Mexican anthropology, a reader (or listener) who has been bit by the running bug cannot help but feel McDougall's manic energy and succumb to the same compulsive quest that drives him farther into the Copper Canyon. By becoming a runner on par with the great Tarahumara people, we somehow become at one with our best selves now, and reach across time to come into contact with our natural, ancestral selves.    The book is the PERFECT audiobook. No world class aria or hardcore heavy metal could possibly provide such inspiring fodder for a 20-mile run.    McDOUGALL'S MANIA    No one - NO ONE! - not even the most avid runner wants to read a history of running, or a book on technique, or a book on diet. McDougall's genius is in somehow putting great chapter length dissertations on all of these subjects neatly into the overarching plot of his - and his compatriots - quest into the canyon to race the Tarahumara.    It is done so well, and McDougall's drive so familiar, his energy so infectious, that even as he pursues a life-changing training regime, you can't help but fell: \\"I should do that too!\\" The Tarahumara can run for days because of their incredible, lean protein, low-calorie diets, with maize-kernel pinole and chia seeds as the foundation. Off we go to the natural seeds store!    The Tarahumara can run hundreds of miles a week without injury because they train in uncushioned leather strap sandals. Inside of a week, I'm down at the local track in bare feet, doing 6 x 800 speedwork.    At the risk of making too simple a comparison to another book based in the Americas, Born to Run delivered in a way that I felt that this year's much-heralded [[ASIN:1400078458 The Lost City of Z: A Tale of Deadly Obsession in the Amazon (Vintage Departures)]] did not. Grann's personal connection to the story that drives Z - the doomed final Amazon journey of explorer Percy Fawcett - is strained and often devolves into extrinsic introspection and autobiography. Fawcett's mystery somehow becomes Grann's memoir and the work suffers as a whole.    By contrast, McDougall inserts himself in the story of the Tarahumara organically, and only to the extent necessary to act as conduit to their incredible story. The book connects cultures by connecting runners: physically, historically and experientially. The connectedness is real. McDougall is really working at a high level here. This great story has found its teller. Highly recommended.
6302787300|5.0|Excellent movie.  Some scenes however, are historically incorrect. For example: since the Santa Maria was shipwrecked off the northern coast of Hispaniola, making it necessary for 39 volunteers to stay behind in the fort of \\"La Navidad.\\" Martin Pinzon was at this time AWOL with the Pinta. All three ships were depicted leaving for Spain in January of 1943 instead of only the Nina.  The Nina and Pinta did not rendevous until days later out at sea.    The music of Vangelis makes this movie a classic otherwise.
B002NPUCP8|5.0|Well I dunno if those who gave her two stars were listening to the same CD as I did.  I thought the complete CD delivered a true talented guitarr player that also has a great voice.  And that delivers on each track to the fullest.  Beeing in the music buisness for over 3 decades I've never encountered a new artist to deliver  an album with such force and high quality music and lyrics on each track.  Tracks are all delivering a variation that makes the CD pleasant to listen from start to end  and without a dull moment. I highly recommend this album.  If I had a radio station I would play each track for 11 days as powerplay on the radiostation.  Better then this is hard to find.  I wish Orianthi the best of luck and I think soon she will be playing with the big guns in the  rock industry as a guest artist.  Some example Bon Jovi, Aerosmith to name a few.  PS. This is the first one I've heard of her... I dunno of her earlier works. DS

This particular album to me is good, but I like \\"Aenima\\" and \\"Lateralus\\" more because it sounds to me like the band played what they meant to. Although \\"Undertow\\" is very good, it does sound and feel experimental to me.    I bought my CD used but the disc was in almost brand-spankin-new condition.

0143116053|5.0|Deaf Sentence is, hands down, one of the best novels I have read this year. Period. It starts out chuckling-to-laugh-out-loud funny, but then turns serious and ultimately becomes very dark and sad. A lot like life itself, one might say. The protagonist, Desmond Bates, is a retired college linguistics professor in the north of England who has lost a wife to cancer, but then remarried quite happily to a woman several years younger. The title of the book comes from his increasing deafness, which began in his forties, but has become quite profound by the time of the story. Bates is sixty-five-ish (like me) and often quite frustrated with his progressive inability to decipher normal conversation, particularly in a crowded noisy environment. There are many comical scenes about how this can lead to misunderstandings and embarrassments. But the truth is, for the person who can't hear, it's not very funny at all. It's just ... well, frustrating as hell. Forced into an early retirement because of his disability, Bates is kind of unmoored and feels rather useless. He becomes accidentally involved with a dangerously nutty postgrad female student, an American. Not sexually involved, although that is a distinct possibility from the outset. This girls's dissertation topic is the textual analysis of suicide notes. See what I mean? Nuts! Suicide becomes an underlying theme here, however, as Bates realizes, to his surprise, just how unhappy his deafness and lack of purpose has made him. There are other elements in his life that take center stage too: the younger, attractive wife who is just becoming successful; an aging father (89) who lives alone in London and is becoming gradually unmoored and confused; grown children with their own lives. There are particularly moving moments in the latter half of the book that could make you cry. Exchanges between Bates and his rather distant grown son, Richard, who reveals how sad he was when his mother died and had wanted to be there, but was instead on a ski holiday with friends; and also between Bates and his father, who recalls his own first memories. In short, if you are of a certain age (in your sixties) and a part of that \\"sandwich\\" generation, then this book will decidedly hit home. The fact that the story was set in England was no impediment. This is, quite simply, a beautifully written and extremely human story. Lodge admits that, in the Acknowledgements - that certain elements of the story - the narrator's deafness and his dad - are autobiographical. I felt for him, in that regard, but make no mistake. David Lodge is, in this book, at the very top of his form as a writer. Highly recommended! - Tim Bazzett, author of LOVE, WAR & POLIOnstead on a ski holiday with friends; and also between Bates and his father, who recalls his own first memories.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|My wife and I just went to see Star Trek 2009 for the fourth time.  We have NEVER seen any film at a theater four times.  Script, acting, direction, story -- the best we've ever seen.
B001AVCFJM|3.0|The latest installment of the Star Trek series is a good movie, and it was worth the price of the tickets.  However, this movie is not a good STAR TREK movie.  Star Trek has always been about the stories and the characters.  This movie focuses on action and explosions, much like Transformers or other movies of this genre.  The story here is not Star Trek and the flimsy excuse that this is an alternative timeline is feeble.  There are too many holes between the story lines and the original canon to list.  It is an attempt to milk more money from a highly successful franchise (look at how many DVD reissues have been marketed).  If you want to watch a good movie, buy this DVD.  If you want to watch good Star Trek, go back to the television series (\\"The Visitor\\" from Star Trek:  Deep Space Nine for example).  This movie is not your father's Star Trek, but then again, it's not Star Trek.
B00005JK8K|3.0|This is a pretty standard action combat film, with the sole innovation that the plot focuses on the contribution that the Navajo windtalkers made to the War in the Pacific.  Here, the windtalkers are rightly shown as dedicated Marines, fine young lads making a unique contribution.  The combat scenes, while unrealistic from numerous technical perspectives, are well-done most of the time.  The film would have done better to engage in more characterization of the windtalkers themselves.  We never really get to know them, but the glimpses that this film affords the viewer seems to show that if it had gone further down this road this could have been an outstanding film.<br /><br />The film to its credit does a serviceable job of at least acquainting the viewer with the invaluable service that these Navajos gave to America.  These were clearly some of America's finest young men who answered the call at a fateful time in the nation's history.<br /><br />Overall this film holds the viewer's interest, but more characterization, focused on the Navajos themselves, would have been welcome.  RJB.
B0015AARJI|5.0|The Controller was great. No issues what so ever so far. Battery life it's pretty good for a wireless.
B001OQCV24|5.0|I had an interesting pre-cursor while going in to see 2012. I was with a small group of three, and I handed my tickets to the doorman, who, after ripping them and handing me back the stubs, said: \\"Enjoy this graphics, this isn't the kind of movie you go and see for the dialog.\\"  My friends and I looked at each other and laughed. We were also a bit worried. Did we just drop about $15 bucks each to watch another disaster movie with vacant plot and characters? Are we foolish to expect more than a vacant plot and characters in a disaster movie?    Fortunately, my answer is \\"No.\\" The answer from one of my friends who was with me is \\"Sort of.\\" But this isn't my friends review, it's mine. All mine! So, the answer is decidedly...\\"No\\" on both counts. 2012 proves that you can actually have an entertaining disaster movie as well as a few emotional chords to strike.    2012 loads up quite the cast, with Woody Harrelson and Danny Glover making impressive appearances as the doomsday nut-job and the last President of the United States, respectively. However, the two people to follow in this movie -- and who brilliantly contribute to the a fore mentioned emotional chords are John Cusak and Chiwetel Ejiofor (Thank You Wikipedia for help with the spelling). Cusak plays an author named Jackson Curtis (digressive fun fact: in reverse that would be the true name of 50 Cent), a not-so-famous author who has sold little over 400 copies of his published book. It's easy for Jackson, whose day job is chauffeuring the wealthy, to think that he hasn't made even the slightest impression in the cultural fabric of his country. However, Chiwetel who plays the much easier to spell Adrian Helmsley is one of the few people who has read Jackson's book - and was profoundly affected by it. Adrian, by the way, is the guy who brokers the discovery of the Earth's expanding core to the President of the United States. Adrian is also the guy who brokers Jackson's soul-stirring humanizing words to the last vestige of humanity. A humanity that is losing its humaneness in the Darwinian struggle for cataclysmic survival.    I'm serious, this is the subtext of the movie. And I'm even more serious when I say that \\"it works\\". Especially since all of this is the subtle thread to the \\"real plot\\" which finds Jackson trying to get his estranged family from Los Angeles to Las Vegas to China so that they can hop aboard the official and highly-secret and even more highly-exclusive survival plan that has been set in place by the government of every country. It is here -- the flight plans from LA to Vegas to China where we can indulge the irrefutably fantastic disaster graphics promised by the ticket-taker. And, yes, true to the wit of the ticket-taker, this is not a movie you go see for the dialog. Even the director, Roland Emmerich, knows this, since he very cleverly and wisely interrupts several moments of cliche sentimentality. Don't worry, I haven't given anything away. There is nothing to give away in this movie. Emmerich takes everything you would expect in a disaster movie, crams it in and sets it ablaze with the rest of everything else that topples over into his global pyre.    And, yes, it all makes for quite a spectacle to be seen on the big screen. Without a doubt, had I waited for DVD and watched this movie on my much smaller home screen, I would have missed the best part of the End Times.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|From a Mexican point of view, this is one of the best Quentin Tarantino movies. The cinematography is great, the music is, as always, classic Tarantino. The dialogs are genious. What I like about Tarantino is that he respects languages, when no other director makes dialogs in another langauge no matter what nationality are the ones doing the dialogs. And quoting Bridget von Hammersmark: \\"I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you Americans speak any other language besides English?\\". Yes, I know there are Americans that speak more than 2 languages, but why are the Americans the ones that are always complaining about subtitles in foreign movies??<br />Besides, watching Jews killing Nazis is very gratifying. This is a movie I'll enjoy watching again and again.

1595141715|2.0|Thirteen Reasons Why follows Clay who is listening to outdated tapes from a suicide victim he went to school with. The girl Hannah who made these tapes sent the box to the first person who she wanted to listen and then committed suicide. I really wanted to like this book because so many reviews and people I spoke with did but I couldn't help the fact that I couldn't stand any of the characters. Clay for being too wussy to talk to Hannah, and Hannah for blaming everyone else for her problems. Things that shouldn't have happened and that were not great in her life, but also things she set herself up for, even on purpose towards the end. The book never said how Hannah ended her life but there was a lot of speculation. A lot of girls deal with worse things than Hannah in high school and live productive normal lives, I guess I just expected if this girl was going to end her life and be dramatic by sending tapes to everyone on the list that something life changing might have happened. I am the first to love the books that deal with tough issues for teens. Wintergirls from Laurie Halse Anderson is one of my favorite reads of the year. She however makes the situation grave enough so that these are extreme cases. This book gives the air of \\"Oh so that was a tough year in school it sucked, kill yourself and do something really cool while you do that!\\" Hannah blames her counselor for not running after her, why did she leave if she truly wanted help? I found Hannah's reasoning annoying and her reasons not good enough. This being said, the writing style is amazing and I love the different fonts for when Hannah is talking and Clay is talking or thinking. If you like Wintergirls or Speak then you may want to pick this up.<br />[...]

This film is always a pleasure to watch during the holiday season, the music, songs and animation are just remarkable. I love the characters and all the creepy humerous things that they do.<br /><br />If you truly want to blow your kids minds with a Halloween movie I always suggest this one, it will leave them wanting more and next thing you know you'll know you're adding it to your DVD collection.

The sound is much fuller and overall it is sounds like the songs sounded when they were prigionally broadcast on radio...and dont think because this is MONO it will be inferior to stereo.....it actually blows the stereo mixes away....no contest...You need to realize that the four Beatles were present for the original mixdown of each album when they were done in MONO...the stereo mixes came weeks later, when the band members weren't present..and sometimes even used alternate takes as a source..<br /><br />You will still need to purchase the ABBEY ROAD and LET IT BE cd's..as they were never recorded in MONO...and as a bonus...you will most definitely want to grab the NAKED LET IT BE as well...and also get a stereo copy of PAST MASTERS...and that will pretty much give you the BEST quality sound that exists to date for your Beatles collection.
B000OY8NII|4.0|Eureka is just delightful. Fun cast and interesting plots make for an enjoyable TV series.  Almost as good as Firefly but lacking the true science fiction flavor.
0307716988|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was written as if Michael was having a converation with you.  It was very interesting to hear him tell about all his experiences as a child, performer and man.  I especially liked to learn what he says about music.  It would be another journey to look into the musicians Michael mentions he worked with in his book.  He has alot of nice things to say about alot of people.  He shares some very personal things. Lots of pictures (it looks like more people wanted to have their picture taken with Michael Jackson than Michael Jackson wanted to have his picture taken with them).   I'd say it was a very generous action on his part.
B0012GVKW8|3.0|There are a plethora of reviews of the movie, but my review is mostly a comparison of the BD vs DVD version. I won't discuss its merits as movie.<br /><br />Alas, while there is substantial improvement in the video via BD's high resolution, its a disappointment compared to many other BD releases.  Most video images lack sharpness.  Since old movies like Battle of Britain, 2001: Space Odyssey or Clockwork Orange, can compete with recent films like Troy, its clear the folks who mastered Predator did a poor job.<br /><br />Audio does not make full use of imaging although its clearer and more bombastic than the DVD, and since 5.1 Dolby only came in the 1990s, that point can be excused.<br /><br />However, since Predator is sold as a discount BD disk, if you don't own it on DVD, its well worth it, but if you do, think twice, the improvements are not that stark.  However, the BD made if far clearer to me the pilots were still in the chopper after it was downed, the skinned corpses of the Hopper team appear more detailed and ghastly, there is more oomph in the assault on the rebel scene due to the improved sound, you can see the rounds in the mini-gun zip through the gun and its clear how its fed through the backpack ammo case, you can make out the MTV t-shirt throughout most of Jesse Ventura's scenes, you can make out where the commandos were hit by the predator, which was vague on the DVD.  So overall, its an improvement, and worth 3 stars.
B001AVCFK6|2.0|The production effects are good, but the rest is weak ... actors, direction. I saw it in DVD and in Blu-ray. Like I said, a film to teenagers !!! Something like Twilight !!!
B001OQCV24|3.0|On the big screen the action sequences for 2012 were simply fantastic.  Unfortunately the the numerous narrow escapes were so utterly unbelievable, they prevented one from immersing themselves fully in the movie and as such will keep 2012 from being great.  You'll understand when you see the movie and let's face it, you probably will. Now I did say the movie was good, but not great.  The last 40 mins or so drag considerably this is increasingly eviedent after the first 2 hrs of onslaught of disater after disaster.  Was it fun and worth seeing?  Yes.  I wouldn't pay to see it twice though.

B002GY9F9K|5.0|I watched the entire season on television, every week glued to the screen.  When I received the DVD's of the first season, I was super glued to the screen.  It was so much better watching each episode back to back because the plot fell into place for me so much easier.  The characters are amazing and gave me such a range of feelings, from sympathy to compassion to anger.  Even the villian, Darken Rahl, holds a special place in my heart.

So for her birthday I made the mint chocolate cupcakes.  The kids at the party scarfed down these cupcakes like there was no tomorrow.  Usually I see kids eat just the icing off the top - but these kids were licking the chocolate off the cupcake wrapper!!  One of the kids even said \\"You MADE these????  Wow!!\\"    This has become my new favorite cookbook.  Thank you Vegan Cupcakes, for taking over my world!!!
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Supernatural takes lots of imagination to watch. None of the plots are based in reality, though they do have realistic elements. The acting is not superb, but for what the series is, the two main actors do a great job of making the characters believable... and the situations they find themselves in. Seeing how the characters deal with each really dire adversity situation is a hoot.<br /><br />We actually started watching the show just this season, which is the series 5th season, and we bought all the seasons before just to catch up. It's a lot of fun to watch, and we look forward to watching each evening, since the regular TV fare is generally dismal.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Based on previews I expected \\"Up\\" to be another very funny, quality movie from Pixar; however, when I sat down to watch it I got that and much more. It starts sweet with the main character, Carl, as a little boy meeting Ellie, a little girl who shares his desire for adventure and admiration of the explorer Muntz. Carl and Ellie get married and move into the abandoned house where they met. Ellie painted a picture of living in the house beside the big waterfall in the lost valley where Muntz had traveled. As they grow old together they save for this dream only to use the money for other needs as they arise.    The movie turns sad when Ellie passes away and Carl is almost forced into living at a retirement home. To avoid giving up the house, Carl uses an abundance of balloons (doubtlessly saved up from his work selling them) to lift his house off the ground, intending to sail it to that lost valley in South America. Carl soon discovers Russell, a young scout who was trying to earn his last merit badge by helping the old man, accidentally came along for the ride. The two go on an adventure which sees them encounter a rare bird species, a pack of talking dogs, and the adventurer Muntz.  Along the way Carl ends up making some hard choices, such as choosing between fulfilling his and Ellie's dream and rescuing the rare bird. In the end, Russell and Carl each provide something the other needs - Russell needing a father figure and Carl needing a new adventure and purpose.    There are lots of humorous scenes throughout, my favorite being when Carl and Russell first encounter Dug, one of the dogs who can talk via special collars. But it's the story of Carl and Ellie which makes it so much more than a funny cartoon. Even with relatively little screen time and dialog, the scenes where their relationship unfolds are very moving, like any good movie love story.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|Well I selected free super saver shipping and the media was delivered just as fast, 5 days which is good enough for me for FREE.. ;-). Anyways I had to get it shipped to India... since a friend was coming down, he got it for me. We don't have this set available in Blue ray format (only DVD) in India... This is region free so I opted to buy it at Amazon.    Anyway this product came nicely packed and it has one blue ray box that contains 4 Blue ray disks. My wife fell in love with the box itself..     Outer box was made of recycled material which is a very good sign.    I wanted these disks purely as a collectors item.    The Box says 1080i NOT 1080p - I wish it were 1080p but anyways... till they give that out.. I am fine with this.  I got all the 4 Blue Ray Disks - unlike what some individuals have said that two of the disks were the same... I think that was one bad batch then.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is the type of board game that will appeal to people who play Monopoly and Civilization and many more. There are many add-ons to make the game more interesting after time, but not necessary unless you want to have more players than 4.    If you want a board game that allows a better chance of all being able to win, I would highly recommend this game. Also if possible you should go online and play the demo's so you know exactly how the game works and is played. The game is more complicated to learn than say Monopoly but, not that complicated especially after you see the online tutorial.    One suggestion is game play should be described on a DvD so people without internet could easily understand and when you get a new group to play the game, all could watch and understand the principals of the game. This would make start up a lot easier for the novices.    Overall I gave this game 5 stars and Highly recommend it.                              Chee the DamN GnOmE Necromancer

0307269981|5.0|As a Christopher Hitchens' fan, I was nevertheless very disappointed by his review of Stieg Larsson's trilogy of spell-binding Swedish novels. They are about corruption in government, criticism of the Socialistic state of Sweden and it's courts, using Lisbeth Salanger as his protagonist. Also Larsson  makes a point of exposing misogyny very often, and this is perhaps his biggest theme. What else would one expect from a self proclaimed Feminist whose first novel was originally named \\"Men Who Hate Women\\".<br /><br />It occurs to me that Hitchens skimmed these books rather than read them closely, as he made many factual errors: i.e. Salander did NOT have Asperger's Syndrome, as Hitchens claims, rather it was only mentioned as a possibility for her condition but then was eliminated, ruled out. He also talks about her \\"return from the grave\\", which helps him de-personalize her into a cartoon like creature or Nordic god, as he seems determined to equate this very modern novel with Nordic sagas,  and other pre-Christian mystical super human powers. Salander was shot in the side of the head, in fact, and a small amount of soil put over her, as her enemies presumed they had killed her, however, as a cliffhanger one sees in quite a few thrillers, she was only grazed by the bullet, so digs herself out, showing she is not some mythic troll or Flashman, but a real person coping.<br /><br />Another thing that makes me wonder why he is so obsessed with Sweden as some very blond, Nordic holdout from the rest of the modern world is the fact that he says Wynona Ryder should play her in a Hollywood movie \\"except for the hair color\\", meaning blond.  Salander is in fact brunette with \\"very black eyes\\" and her father, whom she is said to resemble, is an emigre from Russia.<br /><br />He also bemoans the use of Swedish place names, but perhaps he forgets this was a Swedish novel, written in Swedish, with events occurring in Sweden.<br /><br />He tries to make Sweden sound like a benign place on the surface, but in reality a racially charged secret port for Nazis, a place swarming with violent Neo-Nazis and skin heads.  In the U.S. we also have our share of Neo-Nazis and violent skin heads, no more and no less percentage-wise than in Sweden, perhaps more in fact because of our racial tension in this country. He refers I think to the Hell's Angels Harley-Davidson Hog riding group that is paid by criminals in Sweden to try to kill Salander. Their dialog with Salanger is in fact extremely sexist and sexually homicidal, but not a word about politics, for sure.<br /><br />As for \\"prurience\\" in the novels, this is simply not so, Hitchens perhaps being too obsessed by 1960 pornography such as \\"I am Curious Yellow\\", which he insists on mentioning.  Sweden is a very morally conservative place today, so this film is irrelevant.<br /><br />As for \\"All The Evil\\", which Hitchens dismisses as melodramatic drivel,  this refers to Salander being the child of a drunken wife beater, who is also a hater of all females, and is an evil criminal whom Salander retaliates against finally at age 12, only to be put into a sadistic psych ward for some years, because her father must be protected by the government, here a small group of corrupt high level Security Council officials, as her father had been a secret, top Russian informant, given a new identity in Sweden, which secret is protected at any cost. Salander is damaged by this, but is a very human survivor, which is why the reader cheers her on.<br /><br />Modern crime writing in Scandinavia is on the rise and is rivaling the English at its best. I suggest Ann Larsson of Sweden and Hoag of Denmark, but there are many more.<br /><br />Linda Williams Standridge<br /><br />Huntington, Massachusettsty a racially charged secret port for Nazis, a place swarming with violent Neo-Nazis and skin heads.

0385504225|4.0|The Lost Symbol follows the same formula as Angels & Demons and the Da Vinci Code. Once again, our hero Robert Langdon finds himself in a difficult predicament that requires him to utilize his knowledge of history and symbology as well as his quick wits. The pace is not as fast as the other two books (the whole book takes place in one location - Washington DC) but the narrative is more believable and requires less suspension of disbelief. The historical anecdotes and tidbits continue to be quite fascinating and you learn a lot about our nation's capital, our founding fathers, and the Free Masons. The payoff is not as shocking or profound as his earlier books, but overall it is a quick and entertaining read. If you like his other books and don't have unrealistic expectations after the Da Vinci code, you should enjoy this one as well.
0440237688|5.0|This story really moved me. Set in the possible future, the concept of Sameness is brought to extreme levels. Members of society barely think for themselves. Everyone has a position, with set tasks and actions to preform everyday without question of why. The one exception is The Giver. He is the holder of memories. Memories that include love and family but also pain and war. When Jonas is picked to be the next Giver, time has finally come for change. The ending is purposely ambiguous. Lowry leaves her readers to make their own conclusions.  1994 Newbery Winner. Highly recommended.

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|First off I just want to say that I was not an animated movie collector, being mainly watching it when I used to take my little cousin to the movies on the weekends.<br />However, Blu-ray have really revolutionized the animated movie industry with its clarity (no movie &#34;artifacts&#34; and digital noise - &#34;digitizations&#34; - whatsoever since it's not shot on film and is not compressed like with regular DVDs).<br />If there is anything that Blu-ray was meant to do, it's to watch animated movies (and I mean these recent CG animation ones, and not those that were made 60 years ago!).<br />So now I am proud to claim that I am an avid HD animated movie collector.<br /><br />And &#34;Up&#34; is one such movie that deserves to be in your collection.<br />This review isn't about any technical aspects (quality of transfer, DVD vs. Blu-ray, etc.).<br />I just want to say that the opening montage (I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it) is one of the most poignant in animation movie history. It's so touching I thought I was watching an Oscar-nominated drama.<br />This love/bond is the backbone of the movie, and carries and ties it all together.<br />This is a movie the children will enjoy, but adults will treasure it too.<br />Pixar has really revolutionized its story-telling with this masterpiece, and they deserve to be commended.<br /><br />PS- it would be awesome if Pixar made a dramatic &#34;short&#34; that tells more about the old couple's love through time. But since this is supposed to be a kid's animated movie I guess that's asking too much. Although the including shorts are wonderful, especially &#34;Partly Cloudy.&#34;
B001QWBM62|5.0|There are three types of users that absolutely need to consider the Zoom H4n:<br /><br />1) The guitar or bass player who wants to capture an idea for a song, along with a vocal track - For this user, the H4n provides a built-in tuner, a built-in metronome, and a simple recording interface that can have you up and running in no time. I'm not this user, but several of my friends are, and when they sat down and looked at it, they wanted to buy mine from me.<br /><br />2) The person people go to for \\"Can you record my band at ______ on Tuesday night?\\" - For someone who wants to capture location audio, especially a mix of ambient sound and a feed from a system, the H4n is very close to ideal.<br /><br />For this type of session, I use the built-in stereo mics to capture un-mic'd sounds from the stage (drums, tambourine, misc noises from the props from on stage) as well as the sound of the auditorium. I place the H4n on a tripod at the foot of the stage, aimed roughly at stage center.<br /><br />For sound that comes through the house system, I bring in a pre-mixed feed from the sound board, and feed it into Input #1 at the base of the H4n, and record everything as 4-channel audio. Afterward, I mix Input #1 into both channels, bring the level of the stereo built-in mics down just a tad, export an MP3, and have a perfectly listenable mix that required almost no setup time on my part, and is mixed and exported in less than 10 minutes. Can it get any easier?<br /><br />3) Someone recording audio for video/film - The new crop of video-recording DSLRs (the Nikon D90, the Canon 5D MkII and 7D, and the Panasonic GH1) all record audio, but you'll be better off recording audio separately, for a variety of reasons. (The fact of the matter is that most indie video should go this route, regardless of the camera being used, but that's a whole 'nother issue.) The H4n provides phantom power, has combo inputs (1/4\\" or XLR), and can even do some rudimentary signal processing, if you're so inclined. (I don't do this, and defer such things to post, but I can understand why some might work differently.) The H4n can record in BWF WAV format, which means if you carefully sync up the clock in the camera with the H4n, and then drop the resulting audio & video into your editor and have them properly sync'd.<br /><br />There are several DSLR configurations that work well with the H4n, but a great setup is mounting the H4n to the camera's hot shoe (get one of the many shock mounts that will handle the H4n), using the built-in mics to get ambient sound (which will be in stereo, if you want it, and will always have the correct left/right perspective to the camera) and then feed audio from a boom mic or a lav (or both) into Inputs #1/2. You have an 1/8\\" stereo output that you can then feed into the mic input on these cameras (usually a mono input, so get a stereo/mono adapter), and then your camera audio, while not great, will be something you can use to sync against (Pluraleyes is a great option there).<br /><br />Another setup for video is to put the H4n on a tripod that is roughly in the center of the \\"180 degree rule\\" space, capturing ambient sound that way, and again feeding Input #1/2 from a boom mic and maybe a lav. You'll probably not want to use the ambient sound, or may not want to use much of it, but it will give your editor a feel for how he/she may want to pan dialog if it's a stereo recording. (Knowing how far left or right someone's voice naturally sounded in the room, relative to a given point, can help you mix things in a way that will sound more natural. Technically, phase issues come into play as well, but you can fake things pretty effectively this way.)<br /><br />*****<br /><br />I currently have a 16GB SD card in the H4n, which gives me about 6 hours of 4-channel recording at 44.1Khz/16-bit. For video, you'll want to go to 48Khz, and you can go to 24-bit for a bit more dynamic range, but I'm skeptical about the ability of this unit to really give you more than 16-bits worth of range from the built-in mics. (You *might* be able to get that from some external mics with really low self-noise, but I haven't seen any test data to support such a configuration.) Because of the ridiculous amount of recording you can do, I generally start the H4n at the first take of a scene, and then capture all the takes in one clip. When we're done with all the takes for that scene, I stop the H4n, set up for the next scene, and then roll it as we begin the first take there.<br /><br />I suppose I could find some things to complain about, but at this price, it seems kind of silly. The remote control is a probably good idea if you plan on mounting the H4n on a camera or on an elevated boom, but I've not missed it.<br /><br />EDIT/UPDATE: DEAD BATTERIES WILL MEAN CORRUPTED FILES<br /><br />One of the more recent ways I've used this is to grab sound at weddings from string instruments or other players that might not be mic'd. I did this recently, and was unable to find an AC outlet, so I had to run on batteries. Unfortunately, the batteries will only go about 45 minutes when they're phantom powering a Rode NTG-3 (the mic I have trained directly on the instruments), so it croaked during the service.<br /><br />Here's the bad part:<br /><br />When the H4n dies while recording, it will corrupt the files on the SD card. Some users online have reportedly been able to recover the files, but I was unable to do so (IT consulting and data recover is part of my business).

0756655730|5.0|Frankly, given that this was published by DK Publishing, I thought it was going to be more of a kid's book. However, it is actually great for adults as well. The text is pretty informative - not quite a biology textbook, but it goes into quite a bit of detail about each species. It covers not just famous dinosaurs but other lesser-known dinosaurs and prehistoric beasts. However, the best part of the book though is the pictures. Beautiful computer generated images of dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals make this book fun to look at. The CG images are almost as good as the ones in the BBC's [[ASIN:B000GTJSFS Walking with Dinosaurs]] and [[ASIN:155407181X The Complete Guide to Prehistoric Life]]. Great for dinosaur fans of all ages!

I walked out the theatre blown away and deeply touched ... and immediately knew i would buy this on blu-ray to play it on my ps3. I dont understand the beef with the price tho i got it for 24 nd some change not the original advertised 47.00 ...anywho ive seen all most all the pixar films nd this one for me ranks behind the 1st toy story (Go see the 3rd movie June 18th 2010!) and that is saying something because as you know all pixar knows how to do is crank out wonderfully imaginative films that unlike dreamworks films are actually worth emotionally investing in lol

B0002IQAMW|3.0|First, let me qualify this review by saying that Eat a Peach is one of my favorite albums. This review is not about the album itself or the music. What I really like about the SACD treatment of classic albums is the ability to be completely \\"immersed\\" in the \\"field of play\\". Another plus with the SACD format is the clarity that it often brings to tracks that were hard to discern in the album's earlier editions. I'd say that the SACD of Eat a Peach accomplishes the latter benefit. \\"Les Brers\\" is where this SACD mix really shines, in my opinion, bringing out all of the percussion tracks with great clarity. The live tracks on this disc are also worthy of applause. \\"One Way Out\\" and \\"Trouble No More\\" have a greater presence and the rhythm section is really pushed to the forefront of these songs, giving them added urgency and a feeling that the performance is happening right in front of you. Unfortunately, this disc does not achieve the full musical immersion that I had really hoped for and that's why it gets 3 stars instead of 4 or 5. \\"Mountain Jam\\" is where I really thought the SACD mix would shine and provide that immersion, but I find this mix not to be all that different from previous mixes and certainly no better than the other live tracks on this SACD. That aside, I don't regret this purchase. If you own an SACD player and a system that's capable of playing back the 5 separate channels and you are a fan of the Allman Bros., I heartily recommend this disc.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|This gripping revenge thriller will keep you guessing from beginning to end and keep you talking long after it is over. With it's unusual style and it's extremely complex plot, Memento will take you for a mesmerizing ride that you will not soon forget. Leonard, possessing a rare brain disease that leaves him incapable of forming new memories, is on a constant search for the man who murdered his wife. Leonard's disease, however, makes this search for revenge seemingly impossible. He must assemble numerous clues for himself, some in the form of tattoos, others in the form of Polaroid pictures of people relating to his search. These clues leave Leonard with just a hint of who the people around him are and provide him with knowledge of the previous progress he has made. The viewer follows Leonard, without any awareness of who is pulling the strings, from the eventual finding of the suspected killer to the start of Leonard's escapade. This backwards telling of events leaves the viewer in a similar state to Leonard's, having no idea what has just previously happened and how or why the current situation is taking place.    Memento is a great movie to own because it is one of those rare movies that you will want to watch over and over again. With it's intricate plot and changing perceptions of characters throughout, there is always some missed hidden detail waiting to be discovered. If you like thriller movies that will keep your mind stimulated while keeping you at the edge of your seat, you need to buy this movie. It is a masterpiece that must be seen.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|I would encourage anyone who has neglected to read the one star reviews to breeze by a few.  They overanalyze, nit-pick, cry canon, and all the while they forget where Star Trek came from.  Plot holes, fuzzy science, continuity problems and totally illogical sequences of events are all par for the course.  Star Trek was pitched, forty-odd years ago, as a \\"wagon train to the stars.\\"  Your archetypical white hats shoot it out with your archetypical black hats and justice prevails.  Star Trek swapped out six shooters for phasers and recast Tonto as a guy with pointy ears and an unfortunate hair cut.  It's kitsch with just the right amount of heart.  Those among you who regard this movie as a corruption of the creator's vision, let me remind you that his vision included: Nazi planets, Mafia planets, space hippies, badly choreographed fight sequences with stunt doubles that bear no resemblance to the actors, and less than a dozen filmed sequences and stills of the starship Enterprise that were reused over and over again for the duration of the series (all very grainy and since they have been digitized, you can see the wire the ship was hanging by.)  Silliness, but we love it.  Like a big old spacey cheeseburger.  And I think that J.J. Abrams cinematic offering is a clear demonstration of that same love.  There are a number of things that don't make sense ... but now, when people crack jokes about James T. Kirk making out with green women, they will actually have some basis for it.  Never actually happened on the show.

0810983915|4.0|Although I am 13 and a little old to be reading this level of book, I have to admit that it is very funny.  I have read the entire Diary of a Wimpy Kid books and I never get tired of them.  I whiz through them every time, laughing out loud and always wondering what will happen next to the pessimistic boy named Gregg who is the main character.  This humorous book is one that I would recommend to anyone, of any age, who is ready for a good laugh.      This book is called \\"Dog Days\\" not only because Gregg and his family get a dog, but mostly because Gregg spends his summer being very lazy.  First, Gregg finds out that his parents are not going to go to the usual summer beach house because they are short on money.  While his mom wants to experience \\"family fun\\", Gregg finds himself happy with playing video games all day long, watching movies all night long, and then sleeping in and ticking his dad off.  Through out the book, Gregg experiences a mean older brother, an annoying little brother, two no fun parents, and now-a dog? When the dog starts to make Gregg's summer even more miserable, he thinks he mine as well just go back to school now.  But when Gregg's ex-best friend invites him to a summer beach house he tries to make something positive out of it.  Although this beach trip doesn't turn out exactly how it was planned, Gregg decides that he'd rather just sit and play video games inside.  In the end, Gregg comes to the decision that his family isn't that bad at all.      Although it seems as though a book about a pessimistic, video game loving kid would be boring, I assure you that it is not.  With the cartoons giving a peek at what happens next, this book is always interesting.  The way Gregg thinks and the way Gregg's plans always turn out different than he thought is humorous until the very end of the book.  To learn more about Gregg's adventures read Diary of a Wimpy Kid (#4) and you'll find yourself laughing out loud.
B001U7FWM8|5.0|I'm a child of the Seventies and Eighties, and I still adore bands like The Smiths and The Cure.  I've always preferred unusual, well-written pop music laced with a tinge of melancholy. There aren't too many modern bands, in my mind, that fit the bill. Then I heard Grizzly Bear.    Their music seems very modern and unique...Very well written...And it definitely has a strong pop music sensibility.  Yet I hear the past too...and that subtle tinge of sadness that I love.  This album has become a fixture on my stereo, and it is one of the few albums that I find myself listening to in its entirety.

B0026IQFS0|5.0|I'm not sure what the other reviewer is talking about. There is a certain amount of nautical jargon used in this book, the question is whether you will skim past some of it (treating it kind of like the \\"techno-babble\\" sections of a Star Trek movie) until later when it might start to sink in (like when you're reading the 7th or 8th book of the series) or if it will distract you so you can't appreciate what a great book this is. The author even throws in a non-sailor character who is a useful vehicle for having things \\"explained\\" to the rest of us who are not in the British Navy at the turn of the 18th century.    But, if you aren't thrown off by a bit of sometimes mysterious (but always colorful) talk of the \\"stunsail\\" and \\"the topping jib hoist\\" you are in for a treat. The characters here are amazing, the way their relationship builds and your knowledge of them increases for book after book is masterful. There is a major, major plot point about Doctor Maturin that isn't even revealed until book 3 of the series (and not needed before that point), that is an indication of how much character development is going on.     I also really like all the various social melieu's portrayed (sailing life, both before and behind the mast, English country life, both upper and lower class, and as you read through the series you will literally (or is that literarily) travel the globe to the middle east, south pacific, antarctica, etc.).    Read this book now, and then you'll have a wonderful series to look forward to reading in the future...

B002OB9KPE|5.0|Upon first spin I wasn't in awe of Transatlantic's third studio album but as is the case with some of the best prog albums out there, a few more listens were required to really digest what I heard. First off, the negative. The second disc pretty much stunk where the original material was concerned. I loved their take on \\"Return of the Giant Hogweed\\" and the other covers were pretty nice as well. Only Lenny Johnson had some redeeming values to it. The other stuff was either pointless (\\"Lending a hand\\") or basically CCM (Contemporary Christian/Crappy music) which is almost always sub-par musically. (By the way, I'm a christian who owns a fair amount of wonderful Christian music and don't mind the religious elements in music)<br /><br />Back to the positives. My first spin had me really enjoying the first three parts of the epic, but then it seemed to taper off into filler-land until the last 2 tracks with the last track seeming like it was \\"dancing\\" close again the CCM. However, after allowing the music to soak in over several more listens, I really warmed to almost the entire album and now consider it to be on par with their first album and almost on par with Bridge across Forever.<br /><br />And who knows, it may surpass BAF at some point for me, but for now, I'd say this is another 5 star effort from the group that definitely goes a different direction than their previous two albums while still containing some of Roine and Neal's signature sounds.
B00005ABX0|5.0|The cleche is that when Smile blew apart in early 1967, that was the end of the artistic growth of the Beach Boys. True, those lush orchestrations Brian was developing stopped after the implosion, but there is another way of looking at the story.<br /><br />I bought these two albums seperately in 1995. A life long fan of 1960s music, I was always curious to find out about that \\"other\\" Beach Boys. The late 60s material that was not about cars, surfing, and hamburges--the songs mom and dad did not know, but hardcore music people were aware of. Ironically, I loved both these albums. I knew little of the Smile story or Pet Sounds. Atypically enough, these were my first two Beach Boy buys, and only later did I work backwards to the surfing music.<br /><br />But what struck me about both Wild Honey and Smiley Smile--which I actually thought was Smile and thus I wondered what the big tragity was--was how good this band was at making great music with spontainous little one offs. Wild Honey's title track is a great jam, and you can hear the innate talent of this band, even when they're stripped. The minimal panio lines and rasping cymbals that fill the tracks on Wild Honey show this band could create magic in the most minimal of settings.<br /><br />Smilely Smile works the same with a different type of music. \\"She's Going Bald\\" is the band working with almost nothing, but listen to how they bind their voices to create the richest of textures. The lean version of \\"Vegitables\\" here is litterally the band singing over a thumping bassline, but there is  more meat here than a lot of bands  offer at full power. \\"Woody Woodpecker Symphony.\\" is just plain brillant.<br /><br />All these later as a fully educated Beach Boys fan, I can see why these albums both were a bringdown after the promise of Smile, and seemed rediculous as Hendrix, the Doors and Cream were taking over rock.<br /><br />But I'll tell you what: even if these albums were done by an unknown 60s band and sold 1000 copies each, some smart little labal would be issuing them today and they would be appreciated as we appreciate lost geniuses like Bill Fey or Emmit Rhodes.<br /><br />This may not be the Beach Boy's we may have wanted, but it is great music.ld be issuing them today and they would be appreciated as we appreciate lost geniuses like Bill Fey or Emmit Rhodes.

1593080409|5.0|I loved the first volume and the second one is just as good as the first.  I recommend this book to anyone who likes sherlock holmes or is going to see the movie so they can say \\"THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN!\\"
0385504225|4.0|I have to agree with some of the reviews here in that The Lost Symbol is not as good as the previous two books. I didn't expect anything greater, so I'm not horribly disappointed. The book is still a page turner. For me it was exciting because I do live in Washington D.C. and do know many of the places he writes about. A lot of the reviewers here will negatively discuss his writing style, and say that it was predictable - yes the book is predictable, just like Harry Potter is predictable, why? because each author has a style so get over it. However, I will say that the book could have been better edited, and shorter. I also agree that the focus on Noetic \\"science\\" in the end proved useless in the context of the plot.     Still a good read though, and I recommend.
B002MW50KY|5.0|I absolutely love this album! For     those that make fun or hated it, remember there is a cause behind it. I almost cried when I read all profits were to be donated to Feeding America. This is a very great and generous gift from an amazing artist with a kind heart and thoughtful spirit. Of course his voice his rough, it has aged with him and, to me anyway, is still just as beautiful. The whole album leaves you with warm memories from holidays past. Thank you, Bob!
B001G0MFOM|1.0|I am highly disappointed in The L Word Final Season. I watched originally on Showtime with great expectation especially for the last episode. I don't know what happened to the show. The truth is, it was never the same since the creators decided to cut Dana out, after that they barely hung on - but the show was still entertaining. The Final Season however was just plain bad.     First, I don't care if you have gender dysphoria - just because you take hormones does not mean you automatically turn into the opposite sex, and therefore your sex organs no longer work according to their original settings. Max's whole \\"Oh I didn't think I could get pregnant\\" was an insult to people facing this issue, as well as an insult to a character who supposedly is intelligent enough to create complex IT programs, but apparently didn't get 4th grade biology. Girls and boys, penis and vagina equals baby, even if the penis is gay and the vagina is confused. So...girls and boys, put a rubber on it and move on. Having Max become pregnant was just plain cheesy, especially since the plot was created only shortly after the idiocy of the \\"pregnant man\\" story. Good job creators, you took a break through character, and screwed it up.    Second, yes Jenny needed to die - but was it necessary to make ME want to be the killer? The character was already annoying to began with, and the majority of The Final Season was basically \\"The Jenny Show\\" and \\"How will Jenny make me want to kill her today?? hmmm.\\" Tedious.     Third...Shane should have grown up. Brian Kinney of Queer as Folk was a much better written character than Shane, and even he grew up in the end. I personally did not see any growth in any of the characters apart from Helena.     Finally...how dare you not re-introduce the entire cast when they say goodbye? I didn't see Carmen, Marina, or Dana in the final \\"good bye shots.\\" Carmen and Marina showed up in a tape made by Jenny, which begs the question...why didn't Marina just come back andtake Jenny? That would have been a better rap up of the show.     Overall, I personally hated this season. The best (and it's a stretch) that can be said for this season, is the last episode where Tina and Bette are sitting at the porch, and we see Shane walking back home supposedly from another night (just as in the very first episode). It was bittersweet, and a good reminder of just how good The L Word ONCE was.
031606792X|2.0|I loved the first three books, they were dark and powerful... I felt compelled to read to the end. However, the ending of this book and subsequently the saga (I fear), was beyond disappointing.. **SPOILER ALERT*******  This book ends the series as if they will happily ever after, TOTALLY ignoring everything that came to pass in the earlier books. The ending felt like it came out of no where, and it felt lazy... She didn't know how to end it, so she waved her Disney/fairy princess wand and ended the saga in a never never land fog of everything will be perfect forever. Just plain sad.
0143038419|4.0|First of all, \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" is incredibly well written and read (I also heard the CD version). I love the story, how she describes her life before, and every experience she goes through. I love the lessons, the quotes (some of them I keep around now), the characters she meets and what they teach her. The book has made it into my top favorite books of all time. The only reason I give it 4 stars, is that while the parts \\"Eat\\" and \\"Pray\\" were absolutely amazing, her travels in Bali lacked discoveries. I was expecting her to describe a lot more, since she went to Bali to well...live with a wise man. Instead I guess she went full circle to find love again - which is nice for her, but it made the ending a bit dull.     So I highly recommend the book, especially the audio version because it's read by her (which makes the Italian parts sometimes really funny), she puts just as much passion into reading her story, as she did into writing it. However, do I think this book should be made into a movie (supposedly starring Julia Roberts)? NO. It's an eye-opening read if you know how to find the lessons, or even if you just want to live through someone for a little while. However, it is not enough of a story to make a movie about.    Still, I hope to have more books from her soon.
B002CMLIJ6|5.0|I liked this movie, which as you know, sinks down to the origin of Wolverine.  It also shed some light on the origin of Storm and Scott.

B002Q4TKAY|5.0|America has never fully embraced the Killers like the rest of the world.  Being from the States, I can't really explain it. My hope is that Live from the Royal Albert Hall will change all of this.     I know alot of great things have already been posted about the DVD/CD, but I really don't think that you can overstate enough what a truly great performance the Killers give.  The energy they have with each song is unheard of with most of today's bands.  If Brandon sounds out of breath it's because he is running all over the stage singing his heart out.      If you stopped listening to the Killers after Hot Fuss, I strongly encourage you to get this.  I think it will give you a great appreciation not only for Day and Age, but also Sam's Town.  They perform 8 songs from Day and Age and 7 from Sam's Town.  These guys are so much more than Mr. Brightside.    If you are a Victim, then you already own this and you have watched it 3 or 4 times already.  You have also probably jumed up and down on your couch several times while screaming \\"I've got soul, but I'm not a soldier\\".  I say good for you.

B001KVZ6G6|3.0|A wonderful short film stretched into a two hour movie. Bigger ain't always better.<br /><br />The first part is moviemaking at its best and a milestone in animation. The two minute depiction of a lifetime marriage is a class act in itself: moving storytelling without a word spoken. Audiences the world over mellow and cry; why shoudn't they? Whereas, the scene when the balloons burst out and the house takes flight constitutes the film's showstopper, meaning not only that it's the most spectacular, but that it marks the emotional conclusion of the story, and should have ended it right there. For beyond that point, the sentimental balloon can only deflate and go down.<br /><br />Two minor gripes on the descent:<br /><br />Supposedly, once you buy the idea of a balloon flying house, anything goes. It does not. Talking dogs that fly planes can extract a laugh or two, but they totally wreck the mood created so far. It's like matching a Magritte with \\"Dogs Playing Poker\\" (a painting lampooned in the movie, by the way) on the basis that they're both surreal images. Not so. One pertains a subtle magic that's incompatible with the other's bold crassness.<br /><br />Second, I don't quite get the villain. Sort of an airborne Captain Nemo; a discredited, embittered mad genius bent on vindication, if not revenge. In an obvious nod to both Verne and Disney, Muntz's art-deco zeppelin resembles Nemo's lavish Nautilus. Yet the man ought to be a centennial old geezer by now, instead of the silverhaired swasbuckling fiend that comes up with talking devices for dogs but can't catch a giant peacock that only requires a bite of chocolate. That's another thing: people who love nature and adventure tend to grow happy and wise as they get older. Would anyone kill an endangered bird, let alone shoot a kid, after a lifetime of experiencing nature's wonders? Sorry, doesn't click.<br /><br />At long last, the movie ends as it should: the house arrives at the falls, the boyscout earns his badge, and the old man reacquaints himself to life. Lovely film that should have followed its own moral: in life, as in balloons and movies, one has to drop dead weight in order to soar.life.

B001OQCV24|5.0|I just saw this one in the theater and it was excellent!  I love a good disaster movie.  It was a good storyline of disasters striking and the stunning visual effects that go with the disasters.  No kidding, the computer graphics were some of the best stuff I have ever seen in a disaster movie. It was about 3 hours long and I would watch it again, in a heartbeat.  John Cusak is one of the primary characters.  Morgan Freeman plays the US President.<br /><br />The movie begins in 2009, in India, where heavy rains are taking place.  An elevator descends deep into a copper mine where scientists are studying solar eruptions that have been occurring and \\"are heating up the Earth's core like a microwave.\\"  From India, our Geologist, Adrian, travels to Washington DC to advise the White House of a national geological crisis.  We fast-forward 6 months, into 2010, to a summit in British Columbia, advising members that the world will soon be coming to an end.  We then travel to see Tibetan Monks talking (in Tibet), to London in 2011, and to Paris.<br /><br />Then it is 2012.  The biggest solar climax in history, along with a galactic alignment, is predicted.  The governments are making arrangements to ensure their continued operation, and the filthy rich are buying tickets for special passage \\"out of Dodge\\", so to speak.<br /><br />All of a sudden, the xxxx begins to hit the fan as the San Andreas Fault begins to shift and streets start cracking down the middle in San Francisco.  About this time, Cusak (a divorced father of 2 children) picks his children up to take them to Yellowstone National Park, not knowing the military has closed the park off to tourists.  It seems the super volcano has become rather active and is expected to erupt as the Earth's crust is destabilizing (like dissolving).  In the wooded area surrounding the Park, we meet Woody Harrelson, who appears to be a hippy fruit-loop kinda guy.  Woody is studying all this stuff and broadcasting to anyone who will listen.<br /><br />Meanwhile, temperatures continue to rise globally as spectacular visual effects begin appearing.  The story heats up as fast as the Earth's crust and things are poppin' and people are hoppin'!  Everything stayed pretty intense for the rest of the movie, so much so that I left with a very slight headache from the level of intensity.  Quite simply, I was bustin' outta my chair.  It was completely enjoyable and very entertaining.<br /><br />As a side note, I have read quite a bit on 2012 and no one knows what is going to happen, if something will happen, or when something will happen. I have my own thoughts and feelings.  If you watch this movie, please don't do so in fear.  Watch it for entertainment purposes.

B001OQCV24|4.0|Roland Emmerich's \\"2012\\" will probably set records. In all my years, I've never seen a film where Earth is so spectacularly destroyed. If you can imagine \\"Earthquake\\" crossed with \\"Dante's Peak,\\" \\"Deep Impact,\\" and just a hint of \\"The Poseidon Adventure,\\" you still wouldn't come close to understanding the level of devastation this film depicts. Cities don't just fall to the ground in a pile of rubble; houses, streets, freeways, and even entire skyscrapers practically disintegrate as massive cracks form at the surface. Tectonic plates shift thousands of miles, causing coastal cities to literally sink into the ocean. We see tsunamis thousands of feet high. We see the entire state of Hawaii turning into an active volcano. We see the caldera in Yellowstone National Park erupting, sending chunks of mountain the size of football fields whizzing through the air.    My hometown, Los Angeles, is the first to go. We've lived through our share of large earthquakes, but I can safely say we've never had a shockwave make the ground rise and fall like ripples in water. And I'm pretty sure we've never had a magnitude 10.9 on the Richter scale, with fissures as wide as the Grand Canyon branching off of the San Andreas Fault. Emmerich, whose filmography suggests he's going through an apocalyptic phase, doesn't merely entertain the idea of such catastrophes actually happening - he creates them and, in a good way, finds ways of beating you over the head with them. When it comes to destruction, his imagination knows no bounds. Apparently, neither does the patience of the special effects department, who must have worked for months on end without taking a break. How many computer companies were involved with this film? All of them, it seems.    Similar destructive events occur in Las Vegas, Rio de Janeiro, and The Vatican, where a crack runs across the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and splits the \\"Birth of Man\\" painting at just the right spot. And let's not forget the monstrous wave thatcarries the USS \\"John F. Kennedy\\" all the way to the White House.    But before any of this happens, we're introduced to a slew of characters. The most prominent are struggling author Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), his estranged ex-wife, Kate (Amanda Peet), and their young children, Lilly and Noah (Morgan Lily and Liam James). Tagging along with them is Kate's new boyfriend, a plastic surgeon named Gordon (Thomas McCarthy), who doubles as an amateur pilot. There's also Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a scientific advisor who reports to President Thomas Wilson (Danny Glover) and his Chief of Staff, Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt). Rounding out the cast is Zlatko Buric as a Russian billionaire, Thandie Newton as the President's daughter, and Woody Harrelson as a prophetic wacko who runs a radio show from his RV in Yellowstone.    I'm not going to reveal the specifics of humanity's fight for survival, but rest assured, it involves secret government projects, debates over who should live and who should die, and a lot of tragic (if brief) death scenes. None of this plays particularly well; like most disaster movies, \\"2012\\" goes all out with special effects but skimps on story, character, dialogue, and plausibility. It runs at a lengthy 158 minutes, yet the number of barely developed and unresolved subplots makes it seem oddly condensed. Its greatest miscalculation is its use of humor, which is often relied upon during the most inappropriate times. And as for Harrelson's character, well, he's just flat out annoying. For everything he accomplishes in the way eye candy, Emmerich has never really been one for compelling human drama.    Then again, do we ever go into a disaster movie with compelling human drama in mind? No. Let's face it: In the movies, destruction is cool. There is a reason, after all, that films like \\"Earthquake,\\" \\"The Towering Inferno,\\" or even Emmerich's own \\"Independence Day\\" were such big box office hits. Yes, watching buildings collapse or fires ragingor tidal waves hitting coastal cities or spaceships incinerating the Empire State Building is a disturbingly satisfying experience, but for the life of me, I don't understand why.    Then again, I don't think anyone understands it. I think the filmmakers just go with what works, no questions asked. Emmerich is, like Irwin Allen before him, a master of disaster, and \\"2012\\" should be seen for that very reason. It also has to be seen just for the sake of sheer awesome spectacle - the story may be a failure, but my God, you've never seen anything like it. It's so good looking that we barely notice what little emphasis is placed on its link with the ancient Mayan calendar, which pinpoints December 21, 2012 as the date the world will come to an end. Maybe it's just as well; the last thing we need is a special effects extravaganza giving anyone a reason to worry over nothing. Believe me, it was bad enough entering the new millennium with constant talk of the Y2K virus.

B001OQCV24|3.0|Disaster movies are a dime-a-dozen in Hollywood. The approaching year \\"2012\\" has raised several speculations from the Mayan calendar to Nostradamus to the Bible code. Many believe that the year 2012 would hold special significance in the history of mankind, many think that something life-changing would happen and an epic catastrophe may cause mankind`s extinction. Leave it to Hollywood to take advantage of the \\"2012\\" phenomenon with co-writer/director Roland Emmerich's \\"2012\\". Emmerich has two disaster movies under his belt (Day After Tomorrow and Independence Day) and his latest film \\"2012\\" follows the same formulas that made other disaster movies successful. Sure, there is nothing uncommon about \\"2012\\", following a simple formula usually means huge returns in the box-office because they do work for mainstream audiences. Following the blueprint of past blockbusters usually mean success in the box-office and this film is that exact same overused formula. \\"2012\\" is ridiculously predictable and familiar; it gives you everything you have seen before while injecting it a heavy dose of steroids.<br /><br />The movie begins with two scientists in 2009 who are having a discussion about an impending doom in the year 2012, and there is nothing anyone can do about it. The Earth's crust is about to undergo a polar shift because of the bombardment of neutrinos from the sun's surface. Doctor Adrian Helmsmen (Chiwetel Ejiofor, Redbelt) brings his findings to world leaders to prepare for the eventual cataclysm in order to preserve humanity in the cost of billions in Euro-Dollars in building an ark to save the world`s finest minds and  a fraction of its population. Back in Los Angeles, struggling divorced dad Jackson Curtis (John Cusack, High Fidelity) is on a camping trip with his two kids when he bumps into a conspiracy theorist (Woody Harrelson, Zombieland) who predict that the world will end in the year 2012 and that the truth is being kept secret by the governments of the world. Jackson's first reaction is disbelief, but when a horrible earthquake destroys the area where his ex-wife (Amanda Peet) shops and something clues him in to the possible truth in the warnings, Jackson must race to save his family while the entire world crumbles around them...<br /><br />Let's see, Emmerich is on familiar ground in this disaster epic. A moving speech, check. A car-chase scene with earth upheavals right behind, check. A plane taking off to take our heroes where they need to go, check. Massive Tsunamis that destroy major cities and landmarks, check. A sacrifice, check. Corrupt officials, check. An ending so predictable, check. The film's plot elements are very uninspired, and truth be told the movie offers nothing we haven't seen before. Emmerich does make the special effects grander, more polished and bigger than anything we've seen before. \\"2012\\" is an adrenaline ride that can bring some to the edge of their seats. The film does look very `spiffy' and you feel each drop of debris, each loud explosion, each toppled building as Jackson's family make their way from Pasadena to the mountains of safety. It is a simple chase film with a race against time, the elements used to generate tension are the cookie-cutter kind, not to say that they weren't successful but the film doesn't manage to generate a feeling of dread throughout its entirety. It makes everything all elementary and perfunctory, as the film focuses on a family, a scientist and some key authority figures.<br /><br />To hide the weaknesses of its script, Emmerich opts to overload the audience with astounding, jaw-dropping special effects so that the details of the plot will not reach our brains. The script also opts to incorporate some comedic one-liners. There is also some doses of black comedy as we see someone impersonate California Governor Schwarzenegger as his speech \\"the worst is over\\" precedes the biggest disaster in California.  I guess this was an attempt to please mainstream audiences so that they can't really complain about the bleakness of the film's theme. Approaches like this appear to stem the emotions; while Hollywood calls a balance, I thought it is all formula done to make it easy to relate to. I guess I prefer my `end of the world' movies to go into truths than to become a mere action film. The film does manage to touch on the selfishness of humanity when faced with an impending disaster, the powers of the rich and several morality questions in Helmsley's speech. The conversation between a musician and his granddaughter was pretty touching albeit a bit forced. Yes, Emmerich does try to incorporate human drama, but it is a minor element that becomes outdone by its comedy and visual effects.<br /><br />The characters in \\"2012\\" are pretty much your usual caricatures. There is no doubt in my mind that viewers can predict the outcome of the estranged relationship between Jackson, his ex-wife and his kids, as the new boyfriend angle has been done for years. Danny Glover plays the president of the United States. I thought he was decent as the commander in chief while Oliver Platt plays the conniving stooge that comes in the way of the `right thing'. I guess fear makes people do stupid things sometimes, and the conspiracy to hide the foreseen 2012 disaster also serves as the villain the movie. One question: if everyone knew, and humanity had the chance to come together, would more arks have been built without the almighty lure of greed?<br /><br />\\"2012\\" isn't a bad movie, it is actually an entertaining dose of a disaster film that has all the elements of past disaster movies that just is so much bigger, louder and grander.

B0001L3LUE|5.0|I stumbled onto this DVD while searching for more Vietnam material. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Robert McNamara is one of the most engaging people I've ever seen on any screen. He is about 85 yrs old in this documentary yet he is as sharp as a tack. His 11 lessons are born of a life that has seen so much change and he has held many top positions in various industries.<br /><br />John Kennedy invited him to become Secretary of Defense shortly after his election to President. McNamara gave up a life of lavish wealth to accept.<br />The majority of the documentary involves his own story telling of his life including his term as SoD and his interactions with the presidents he served under.<br /><br />Kennedy tended to listen Johnson tended not too. It's fascinating. He recalls serving under General Curtis LeMay in WW II with respect for LeMay but a clear disagreement with his thinking.<br /><br />During the documentary you can almost see pain on McNamara's face as he recalls the descent into the Vietnam war once Johnson took over after Kennedy was assassinated. From the outset of his term in office, McNamara and Kennedy wanted an exit strategy from Vietnam. Johnson wanted escalation. This almost seems to haunt him as he tells his story.<br /><br />Watch the documentary, watch McNamara's face, look into his eyes and see a very VERY intelligent human being with so much soul yet there's also pain. He recalls his whole life with such clarity and articulation and his stance and beliefs have never changed as proven by the taped conversations in the White House that play sporadically throughout the documentary.<br /><br />An amazing man with SUCH a story to tell. I recommend this highly, it's honest,<br />sometimes brutal and McNamara has the guts to expose his human side to us.
B00005K3OT|5.0|It was a great movie to watch with someone else enjoying it along side with you. It is a couple's style movie with a happy ending.  It is not an action guy flick, but is great for couples because it has a relationship twist that overcomes a mythical theme and conflicts in a quaint French village.  It builds tension in the story plot where as one would start to hate one of the character for their actions and favor the main character for being a strong willed person who decided not to give up.  The back story on the DVD was also great to review to learn about how they made the movie and how if affected the actors.  I lost count how many time I saw the movie over a week's time.  I would move this up to one of my five top five movie picks that I enjoy.
0896898288|3.0|I like the book very much from a historical aspect.  However the CD that came with the book and has all of the patterns on it was broken when I took it from the pocket in the back of the book.  I would like a replacement so I can fully enjoy the book.  The CD is 'half' of the book.  I need the missing half.  I tried to contact you about this matter and have not received a response.  There needs to be a clearer way to contact you when problems arise.  Please respond.
0670020745|5.0|I haven't finished reading the book yet but expect it to be exciting and fun to read based on what I've read so far and the description of the book.  The book I received is used (as I requested) but is in excellent condition.  It seems to me that it took awhile for the book to arrive but I haven't checked dates, etc.  This is my first Amazon review . . .
B000TGJ80I|5.0|5 of 5 stars for the vampire and werewolf movie Underworld. I've seen this movie several times and continue to be amazed and the plot and visual look of the movie. Wow. I keep finding new subtle things in the movie overlooked in my first viewing. This movie is the starter for a 3 movie collection. Telling some of the history and moving forward with this story. Underworld and Underworld Evolution move the story further in time while the third movie tells the history of how we got here.<br /><br />The story is about two races of beings, the upper class Vampires and the worker class Werewolves. In the old times, the races lived together in harmony, now they are at war. This story focuses on \\"a human\\" who we later learn has characteristics of both races and his blood is valuable to both races. Of course, our lead character (Kate Beckinsale) needs the help of a sleeping vampire lord. A very impressive movie with stunning visual look. Once you finish Underworld, keep on going with Evolution and Rise of the Lycans. Highly recommended and added to my list of favorite movies.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I'll try to keep this short. If you've read the other reviews, you know the premise of the show.  It has received  many accolades and some awards. But you know what, there are many really good shows out there now, and it can be hard to keep up with all of them. So if you are still undecided as to whether this show is worth an investment of your time and money, I hope this helps.        If are an avid fan of the Sopranos and The Shield, you will love Breaking Bad.      Do you remember how both of those shows would, at their very best, leave you staring at the screen, with your heart pounding, saying to yourself \\"Holy S---\\"?  Well, there are moments like that in Breaking Bad.  Like  the Sopranos, it effectively mixes dark comedy and violence.  Like The Shield, it has episodes and plotlines that are incredibly intense.  And like both of those shows, it features a protagonist leading a double life. The performance of Bryan Cranston, like those of James Gandolfini and Micheal Chiklis is one of the finest ever seen on televison.  Your move.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I loved the development of the characters in this series.  The writers did a great job to create entertaining, dramatic, emotional plots for the episodes.  Joss Weedon has done fantastic work here to bring the whole thing to life.  It's a crying shame there isn't a greater appreciation for sci-fi on TV, especially when of this caliber. I loved the melding of futuristic sci-fi with the western flair!
B00079FUI6|4.0|Came without a box, just all 6 dvd's (Usually a season will have all the DVD cases in one box to hold them in, but its not really a big deal anyway). Nothing else wrong with it. Love it! Great quality at such a low price.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|Very interesting story concept. However, as with many movies of this nature, the scenes are dark and some of the detail cannot be made out. Also, the music in vital conversation scenes is so loud that the voices cannot be heard to understand what the actors are saying.
B000F6IINK|5.0|Mario Biondi has one of those powerful voices that you do not forget. After hearing one of his songs playing in a lounge of a restaurant, I went home and looked him up on Amazon. The rest is history. After I listened to the sample clips I had to order the CD.  Every song is just as amazing as the other; there is not a single track I am not wild about. This is one of those must-have CD's for any music collection.
B001KVZ6FW|1.0|This is a complaint against Disney/Pixar and a warning to buyers related SOLELY to the 1 disc DVD edition and NOT to the film itself -- which is 5* brilliant.<br /><br />I do not have an HDTV or a BluRay player and have no intent to get one.  When I looked at the three versions of UP there was BluRay, the 1 disc and a 2 disc version which cost $12 more for a \\"free\\" digital copy.  Since I didn't need that, I was happy to buy the 1 disc version assuming they were the same thing less digital.  WRONGO!!!<br /><br />When I got it home I discovered the 1 disc version is as bare bones as they come.<br /><br />NO booklet(!), NO DVD commentary(!), NO outtakes(!)...in fact the only extras are Dug's Adventure and the Pixar short about the stork and the cloud (which is adorable and reminded me of Dumbo's Mr Stork).  I know Disney is all about the Benjamins, but still I cannot believe that Disney/Pixar is so cheap that they couldn't bother releasing all the DVD extras to ALL editions of this film as they used to do.  Why should I have to buy a 2 disc version with a \\"free\\" digital copy of the film when I don't need one just to get the rest of the extras?<br /><br />Not sure what my advice to you would be except to say if you want the whole package and don't have BluRay player, I guess you gotta spring for the 2 disc + digital version.  Bad form Disney/Pixar...very bad form indeed.
0756656230|5.0|Lego never looked so terrific.  Actually, the story of the Lego brand is much more than I ever imagined!<br /><br />This two book set is a must have for Lego builders of any age.  From the development of the universally recognized brand to the stunning photography of the different lines and kits that the developers (builders?) have come up with, this is absorbing.  I found it interesting that the brand originally was started with wooden toys, and only developed plastic from the early 1950's onward.<br /><br />This book is no ordinary book, and the bonus Standing Tall, is superb.  Lego is no ordinary toy.<br /><br />This comes highly recommended and should be on every Lego shelf.<br /><br />Tim Lasiuta
B001FB0WBK|5.0|This one is a must buy and listen/watch over and over.  Can not get enough of this man's talent.
0979127661|5.0|This inexpensive copy of Orthodoxy contains an index. As a self-directed, life-long learner, I appreciate the assistance that a good index gives. I was able to scan the scope of ideas that are covered, and to dip into topics that I found most interesting with ease. I can now use the book as a reference, quickly finding that one, little, elusive nugget that fits whatever I am writing or thinking. If you are a Chesterton lover, or are just starting to know his pithy, humorous, yet deeply provocative writing, you will also appreciate being able to put your finger on a specific thought without the headache of thumbing through or sifting through post it notes.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is a wonderful CD if you have the opportunity to go and watch it do so.
B002DKGWSE|1.0|This is a sick and twisted movie with nothing new, except the sick minds that made it, Don't waist your time. Its over done., and becomes boring to where you wish it hurry up and end.
B002NXSRVG|4.0|I had no prior experience with whatsoever of G.I.Joe and so I just watched the movie like any other sci-fi thriller. Surprisingly, the story, though old fashioned, kept me wondering why the sexy lady villain could be that cold blooded towards her ex boyfriend, and even her husband (Pardon my stupidity). Of course, that was supported by very stylish characters, costume, weapons and the good CG, in particular the chase in Paris and the collapse of Eiffel. Great for home entertainment after a day of hard labor. Recommended!

0385504225|3.0|If you liked The Da Vinci code and thought that this book would provide the same kind of excitement, then you might be in for a let down. The problem with The Lost Symbol is that it is so similar with its predecessors (The Da Vinci code, Angels and Demons) that the plot becomes predictable. Yet again Robert Langdon is called to the site of a murder/mystery, he again finds himself on the run with a female companion, they have to escape from the authorities as well as a medieval villain, the entire plot takes place in a single day and so on. The climax is very underwhelming - especially after all the hype that Brown tries to create about \\"the ancient mysteries\\" and the role of America's founding fathers. Somehow the previous stories with their ancient European histories were much better than this one.
B00007E8UG|5.0|I have two versions of \\" When I Look in Your Eyes \\" CD and the SACD. They are both excellent but the SACD version  is superior to the standard version.  The SACD offers a slightly bigger presentation & more of everything good. All of Diana Krall's Productions are terrific sounding great even on modest systems.
B002VECM40|4.0|As PRECIOUS opens, Claireece \\"Precious\\" Jones, a morbidly obese 16-year-old product of incest, is living a life of misery, hopelessness, and invisibility. Her schoolmates laugh at her, boys on the street abuse her, and her bitter mother tells her she is worthless. Her public school teachers in Harlem have never even looked closely enough to realize that she cannot read or write.<br /><br />Pregnant via rape for a second time, she is kicked out of her junior high school and enrolled in a special class for wayward teen girls. It is there, through the kindness of her teacher (Paula Patton, the pretty co-star of \\"Hitch\\") and classmates, that she begins to blossom as a self-directed human being. Despite this message of human potential and a few lighter moments here and there, the movie remains pretty grim. In this, it sticks fairly close to the novel it is based on, [[ASIN:3499226979 Push]] by Sapphire, who I understand had a part in the casting and other aspects of the filming.<br /><br />The acting is superb throughout. Newcomer Gabourey Sidibe is amazing in the lead role of Precious. Also impressive is capturing the complex emotions of the abusive mother is Mo'Nique. And Mariah Carey is quite good in the role of a Jewish welfare worker (complete with a Brooklyn accent).<br /><br />Andrew Dunn's cinematography is also a highlight. Among the film's strongest visual elements are the depictions of Precious's near-psychotic dissociations. During moments of abuse or confrontation, her drab, gray existence magically transforms into a colorful inner world in which she is a bright star, a handsome, light-skinned man on her arm. And when she looks in the mirror, she sees not her fat, black self but a beautiful, light-skinned glamour girl. Gradually, we see her grow into herself to the point that she can actually face a mirror and see herself.<br /><br />Although toned down somewhat from the novel, the movie tackles the tough topic of homophobia. Precious's abusive parents are virulently homophobic. But through her positive experiences with a lesbian mentor (in the novel, a lesbian classmate also comes to her aid), she comes to reject her parents' bias. The film also tackles other weighty issues, including abuse, incest, racism, and obesity.<br /><br />The film's gender messages are somewhat troubling. With the abusive father absent except for a couple of very brief flashback-type images of rape, our outrage is directed at the mother. This makes a target out of a troubled and incompetent woman who under other circumstances could have been drawn more sympathetically.<br /><br />Ultimately (and I have to be careful here not to be a spoiler), the film's biggest flaw is the unbelievable nature of the redemption story. Indeed, this is a prime example of our culture's near-delusional optimism that Barbara Ehrenreich critiques in [[ASIN:0805087494 Bright-sided: How the Relentless Promotion of Positive Thinking Has Undermined America]]. Precious triumphs through sheer willpower to a far greater degree than is likely for a young woman with this many strikes against her. It's the kind of thing that Oprah (an executive producer, along with Tyler Perry) promotes, but it's a bit like winning the million-dollar lottery.<br /><br />These flaws aside, we are swept along via not only the superb acting and cinematography but, perhaps even more importantly, Lee Daniels' brilliant direction. Daniels realistically portrays the grim despair of Precious's world without ever becoming exploitive. That's a delicate feat, and he pulls it off masterfully.gh her positive experiences with a lesbian mentor (in the novel, a lesbian classmate also comes to her aid), she comes to reject her parents' bias.

B000VKW7AK|4.0|If your looking for that compilation set that has the hits then this is the set for you.  It does a nice job of rounding up Megadeath's hits over the years.
B000J103PC|5.0|Like my review for To Wong Foo, I'm at a loss for words with this one. Its not a genre I regularly review but I'm gonna try my best. Meryl Streep is just a great actress, she can do anything. Period. She plays the boss from hell so perfectly that there is sympathy for Miranda when she has her little \\"heart to heart\\" near the end. Anne Hathaway proves she can do more than Disney films, convincingly leaving that part of her behind and stepping into a more mature role. She plays Andrea very well and she doesn't seem intimidated by Streep at all. Her portrayal as a girl who is naive about the world of fashion but gets sucked into the world of success and begins to lose everything around her is very well done. Stanley Tucci and Emily Blunt are also excellent supporting players in this, Blunt very handily playing the snob and Tucci as the helpful yet sarcastic fashion designer/consultant, whatever. The songs used in the film are superfluous and I wish they didn't have them. They're just really annoying. Well that's all I got on this one.

160094048X|5.0|I thought the author's Vegan Brunch book was about as good as it could get, but this one surpasses even the gingerbread waffles which are my favorite from the brunch book. So far, we have feasted on the sweet port sesame cookies-unique and unbelievable in taste and texture, the blackstrap molasses spice cookies-spicy and full of molasses flavor, and today the cowboy cookies, simply the best choc chip cookie I have ever tasted. They are crispy on the outside, soft and chewy when you take a bite, and the flavor of oats, nuts and coconut blend perfectly. Can't wait to make my way through the rest of the selections. One is more appealing than the next, and the photos are not only beautiful, but accurate representations of what comes out of the oven. Buy this book, you won't be sorry!!
1401323820|5.0|The book written by Richard Castle does justice to the series \\"Castle\\" in a great way.

0061914177|1.0|I am amazed at how Vaynerchuk manages to pack 10 pages worth of information into a 160 page book.  The overall message, you need to avail yourself of online tools as a means of self-promotion an marketing, is perfectly valid, but there is very little in the way of practical guidance.  Your $16 would be better spent on one of Mr. Vaynerchuk's wines than his book.  While there is useful information here, it would fit on the label of one of those bottles.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|This is an example of what happens when a writer gets too famous, and the publishers will publish anything no matter how bad.  While the book takes place over 12 hours, reading it drags on and on.  I read and read page after page, only to realize a handful of minutes have passed in the story.  I checked it out of the library and never finished it.  I found a handful of pages that moved fast followed by dozens of pages that dragged on and on, filled with boring exposition.  When he pulled 1529 ad out of thin air, with logical way of reaching that figure, I put the book down and never picked it up again.       I just noticed that the Kindle version has Text to Speech disabled.  Another failure in my opinion.  Just shows that Dan Brown as greedy by refusing to sell a complete Kindle version.   Text-to-speech is not an audio version, it is a version spoken by a monotone mechanical voice (with no vocal variety or inflection) that makes that book available to the legally blind.  The fact that Dan Brown and Doubleday have chose to disable it, screams discrimination.  However, the blind should feel lucky not suffering through such a boring novel.    Publishers have got to learn that to publish junk turns faithful readers into lost customers.   In the past, I would have picked up any book by Dan Brown.  Unfortunately, I'm not looking forward to Dan Brown's next book.  The Lost Symbol has turned me into The Lost Customer for Doubleday.
B002NPUCIA|5.0|This CD/DVD is something I have been wanting for a while.  It is essentially a \\"Greatest Hits\\" or \\"Best of\\" CD (something I have been waiting for for years).  What makes this CD special is that he has taken some of our (his fans) favorite songs and created fresh updates to them.  In addition to that, the CD is a live studio.  If you have Rick Braun's \\"The Sessions vol.1\\" you know what to expect from this CD.  The DVD gives you a visual of the songs on the CD as well as what he does in preparation for recording the cd.  It's a treat to see him jamming with Dave Koz, Eric Darius and Eric Marienthal.  Definitely worth purchasing.
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|I have always loved Jason's live performance. He is the kind of artists who sing even better in live. His performance is so powerful and he does it so naturally and seemingly effortless. I was at Jason's concert in March, not part of of Gratitude Cafe tour, but amazing just the same. Have not got time to get to the DVD yet but even with just the CD would be worth buying it! Love The Sunshine Song.

B002KREVCO|5.0|While most Rock N'Roll Bands are releasing boxed sets of material that has long since been available to the public on atleast 5 or more different compilations, AC/DC is the only band that I can recall that has never released any such greatest hits compilation, or with the exception of the Maximum Overdrive soundtrack, Who Made Who, any repeated material at all.  For this reason, their new boxed set titled  \\"Backtracks\\" is completely un-released or rare material.  The songs that are not absolutely new, are only those from their first 2 Australian albums High Voltage and T.N.T, which are only available as expensive imports, and the song \\"Big Gun\\" which was only available for a short time on the \\"Last Action Hero Soundtrack.\\"  But now all that has changed with the release of this new box set.  I guess one might say that being this boxed set is full of ultra-rare material, and only features songs that are not currently available on any other CD is a testament to their musical knowledge and appreciation for the fans.  They understand that fans want their money's worth and not just a rehash of readily available tracks and for this small price, they get nothing short of spectacular.  Love for the music, the fans, and good ol' fashioned know-how for the business is what seperates the men from the boys, and AC/DC Backtracks is a prime example.    This set was announced some months back.  It was advertised with 2 versions, the Standard Edition, which I am reviewing, and the Deluxe Edition.  I will discuss the differences between the 2 in the sub-categories below.  I will not list the track details for the discs since they are readily available on the product details page.    Packaging:  The packaging for the Standard set is very similar to some special edition DVD's with an outer cardboard slip case to house the inside fold-out case with attached plastic disc-trays to house the discs.  The Deluxe Edition comes in a 1-watt working amp.  As for the discs on the deluxe set, thepackaging is somewhat lack-luster.  They come in a fold-out book with the CD's held into place with cardboard holes that the CD's themselves rest DIRECTLY on so in time, this could damage the CD's which I am definitely not fond of.  Packaging is definintely better on the Standard set as far as safety and functionality is concerned.    CD's:  The standard set comes with 2 CD's.  The first disc is the studio rarities, and the second disc is the live rarites.  The deluxe set features 3 cd's instead of 2, the first 2 being almost the same, but the 3rd disc is an extra disc of live rarites.  The studio rarities differ in that the Deluxe edition features 6 alternate or extended tracks to songs that have already appeared on albums, while the Standard just features the 12 rarites that haven't yet been released.  The live discs feature more live tracks on the Deluxe edition than on the Standard set, hence the 3rd disc.  I personally opted for the Standard set for this reason.  I liked listening to the songs the way they released them in the first place, and wasn't really interested in longer cuts or alternate takes.  Even though I own every album and DVD of theirs, the extra studio and live tracks just didn't seem very nesasary.    Sound Quality:  Since I am somewhat of an audiophile, and prefer to own original CD releases of albums including AC/DC's, I was not so excited about these tracks being remastered.  Although they are a little over-maximized and some compression is noticeable, they are definitely not un-listenable, and those of you who prefer remastered material, will find that these match the sound quality of the 2003 AC/DC album remasters and will have no complaints.  Besides, this is the only way they are currently available so I definately can't complain.    DVD's: While the Standard set features one DVD which is Family Jewels part 3, the Deluxe edition features this disc, and a 2nd disc which is another live performance \\"Live At The Circus Krone.\\"  Unlike the CD's on both sets, the only difference between the 2 sets with the DVD's is that there is one more DVD on the Deluxe set.  The common disc between both sets \\"Family Jewels part 3\\" holds no difference between the Standard or the Deluxe set at all.    Since I am actually reviewing the standard set, I won't discuss the memorobilia or the Vinyl album of the studio rarites, because I only need to compare the sets between common material between both to help people understand the differences.    As I said before, I'm reviewing the standard set.  When I first heard of this set, I thought for sure that I would buy the deluxe edition, until I saw the price tag.    200 dollars for the Deluxe set, while the standard edition is only 25 dollars.  Although I consider myself one of the biggest AC/DC fans anyone could hope to meet, I could not in good conscience pay such a large amount for ultimately just 1 extra CD and DVD which is what I was interested in.  I could care less for the memorobilia, photographs, or the amp since I don't even own a guitar.  175 dollars more seemed one heck of a price tag for the deluxe set when I was only interested in what the standard set had to offer.  Ofcourse I would love to have the extra CD and DVD, but I won't pay 175 dollars for them.  So if you're like me, and just want the music and aren't concerned with alternate takes or extended tracks, by all means buy the standard edition, if you are an absolute AC/DC junkie and have the means, go ahead and spring for the Deluxe Edition.    Final Judgement:  I gave the Standard edition 5 stars in this review.  If I were to review the Deluxe edition, I would have to give it 3 stars.  Better than bad since it is AC/DC, but knock off 2 stars for the insane price of the extra material not on the standard set, which isn't very much at all.  I hope this review has helped you.  LET THERE BE ROCK!!!!!!
0385335997|5.0|All of Diana Gabaldon's books are true works of art.  Of the thousands of books I've read her storytelling distinguishes her as an artistic craftsman capable of bringing to life complex and compelling stories that blur the mind's ability to reconcile that the story is fiction and not a personal account.  Read them all, read the companion and then read them all again.  Every word is worth it!
B002NXSRVG|5.0|I came to this movie totally uninformed about G.I.Joe, the team, the action figure,etc.  I rented this flick for a buck and had NO EXPECTATIONS! i simply desired to be (somewhat mindlessly) entertained by what i hoped was a real action movie.  This flick delivered on that level  WAAAY  beyond expectations!!!<br />Not only did i get filled in on the back story and individual characters in concise mini-flashbacks, but the entire plot and acting elements were also a bit above average for what the \\"average\\" movie watcher might hope for. By the way, the Editing was AWESOME!!! the cuts were supersmooth and definitely helped maintain the frenetic pulse of the movie!!! most of the time, folks don't take editing into consideration, but when you see how seamlessly the action scenes flow, one to the other, one can absolutely appreciate the editing!!<br />Personally, i'd have been happy to have paid rental price some of the video stores charge ($3.00-5.00)for this flick.  The female leads (Sienna Miller and Rachel Nichols) are stunning and the guys do a bang-up job.<br />Overall, if action and mayhem are what the doctor ordered, with a simple but thorough plot, this flick is for you. Does anyone know if a sequel is planned?<br />You won't go wrong renting this one.

B000H30B2C|5.0|Reviews of \\"King Kong\\", the technically, visually, and dramatically stunning 2005 remake of this now classic cinematic tale, are legion on the Amazon's North American WWW sites. Many critics have \\"panned\\" the film; perhaps they hate the \\"monster movie\\" genre (to which \\"King Kong\\" certainly belongs) so much that such a prejudice blinds them to this particular film's fine qualities. I saw the movie with a friend whose knowledge of motion picture lore dwarfs my own, and who screened this film (from the DVD \\"Deluxe Extended Edition\\" on three discs) after having shown me (along with some other friends) the original R.K.O. \\"King Kong\\" of 1933, with the extra features on the DVD, as well as the interesting 1976 remake, and only then this even more compelling 2005 version of the tale (with its DVD bonus extras), as well. As for that 1976 remake, by the way, it is a lot better, despite the highjinx and compromises of its production and original publicity, somehow adding up to more than its constituent parts, than all the catty remarks that have been made about it assess it to be! Regarding the 1933 \\"King Kong\\", I know rather well a family member of the R.K.O. proprietors' descendents, who lives quite comfortably off the fortune which the royalties of the 1933 film and other R.K.O. movies still generate, so the \\"inside information\\" which he conveyed to me regarding the R.K.O. studio's inner workings had increased considerably my curiosity about \\"King Kong\\". The sheer lore of \\"King Kong\\" on screen in its three full length motion picture versions fascinates but also certainly intimidates a writer to review any or all of these movies; I only am making a short and feeble attempt at the nagging urges and challenge of the good friend who showed me the three films. I'll limit my comments to some of my personal impressions of the three versions.<br /><br />The 1933 motion picture stands up well to the comparisons. The R.K.O. production was of path-breaking importance to the history of cinema in many ways; the bold technical advances made in its filming, which impacted the motion picture industry so strongly, are utterly fascinating, and I would suspect that the 2005 movie, in its turn, already has furthered the art of film-making to at least some extent, even if not so crucially as the 1933 movie had done so. What interests me most, though, after having viewed the 1933, the 1976, and the 2005 films, is the characterisation of the actors in the principal roles (which differ somewhat in the naming, and even career types, of the personages), each \\"take\\" on the characters of this epic story having its own kind of validity.<br /><br />The eponymous mega-ape itself, of course, entails a sophisticated resort to cinematic artifice to bring this character to screen. The 1933 film did this with a degree of sophistication that still commands respect, even compared to the 1976 mechanical ape. What sets off the 2005 achievement is how life-like the monster's facial expressions are and how the beast's muscular movements, even those of its hind-quarters, co-ordinate to convey how utterly simian King Kong is made to behave. The animation of the other prehistoric creatures of Skull Island does not match the detail of King Kong in any of the three films, but even the 1933 movie's screen beasts, all of them, surpass what one sees in such creatures in most films of the genre from as late as the 1950s or even the early 1960s. As for Kong's dizzying ascent of New York City's skyscrapers in the final confrontation of the mega-ape with ground and, especially, air forces in the film's climax on its then tallest of them, as giddy as all of these films make one feel atop the Empire State Building, it is this scene in the 2005 version that left me with the most thoroughly churned stomach and frightened feelings of vertigo.<br /><br />My favourite character among the men of each movie's cast is the male romantic lead, Jack (or John) Prescott, who in 1933 is a virile but winsomely bashful senior member (Bruce Cabot) of the crew of the ship and and of its Skull Island expeditionary force, in 1976 a shaggy-headed, ruggedly but leanly handsome sort of \\"green\\" ecology activist and primate anthropologist (Jeff Bridges), and in 2005 a slim but lithe, reticently mannered, but romantically ardent writer of theatrical and screen plays (Adrien Brody). Bruce Cabot's impersonation is rather of the stolid and thoroughly sailor-like kind, as the script of the 1933 film requires, but he is believable and he does grow as a character when his love for Ann, his (and King Kong's) sweetheart, develops. Jeff Bridges is irresistibly physical and hiply handsome, quite up to any challenge that the human savages, the savage jungle, or the even more savage creatures therein, and New York City in chaos, all pose; his love for the female romantic lead is the most strongly and hormonally sexual in nature of any of the three films' male lead. For me, however, Adrien Brody's exquisite Jack is the most nicely detailed in portrayal, gently rakish, sensitive, and quite visibly head-over-heels in love with Ann right from the moment when he first encounters her. Brody succeeds in rising to the challenge of Jack's ordeals in the jungle and then in mayhem-beset New York City in a way that overcomes, convincingly, what one would expect of the slender, fit, but muscularly only modestly developped wordsmith as Brody embodies him.<br /><br />Of the other male characters, the most endearing is Jimmy (Jamie Bell), the only partly reformed adolescent delinquent who is given another chance in setting his life on a positive course as the most junior member of the ship's crew and who proves his pluck ashore in the jungles of Skull Island; his part has no equivalent in the 1976 film, and so little in the 1933 movie that the character of Jimmy barely registers on the viewer's attention in that original version.  One of the low-key but most strikingly spooky moments in the film occurs when Jimmy explains to Jack (with an objectivity that is all the more dreadful for its calm) just how a victim's body really reacts when stabbed, whether fatally or otherwise.  A chill runs not only visibly through Jack but also through the viewer; this kid knows all about mayhem and murder from his own blade-wielding experience! Providing for me the single greatest urge to buy the DVD in this packaging, as a big fan of all things terpsichorean, is Jamie Bell's work in Jimmy's shipboard dance with Ann, youthfully vigourous and spryly fleet-footed, as glimpsed only briefly in the film as released, but which had been given in full as the scene was filmed so memorably during production, and included among the Extended 3-discs set's extra features (but not even in the Extended Version itself of the film). (Jamie Bell's considerable dancing talents had been in high profile in his first film, \\"Billy Elliot\\", in which Bell played the title role.) This dance number reminds me of the kind of salty antics of the traditional seafaring dancing (without female partner, of course, hence often danced solo), which even then was becoming rare among sailors, that I was lucky enough to observe aboard ship (only far better done in the movie!) when I was in the Navy during the Kennedy years (early 1960s).<br /><br />The other male characters are of somewhat less interest to me (though surely not so to other viewers), although, among them, Robert Armstrong's irrepressibly mountebank Carl Denham of 1933 is the unsurpassed characterisation of his role. Compared to that actor, even Jack Black's amusingly Elton John like impersonation of Carl Denham in 2005, and certainly Charles Grodin as the crassly venture business entrepreneur Fred Wilson, the more-or-less equivalent character in the 1976 version, both pale by comparison to Armstrong's 1933 exuberant show-biz and adventure crazed portrayal of Denham.<br /><br />Fay Wray as Ann Darrow in 1933 remains the most pschychologically convincingrealisation of the role, waiflike but very pretty and perhaps the most consistently wary of Kong's fierceness. Jessica Lange (the equivalent, named Dwan, of Ann in the other versions) in 1976 is the most divergent in personality, so daffily and modishly \\"airheaded\\" during the voyage to Skull Island, but adapting to things adroitly once she finds herself in the jungle. Lange's Ann certainly is the most erotically attuned to Kong; her scene settling in to lounge in King Kong's \\"Easy Boy\\" armchair-like palm is the most visually striking moment for that gal in any of the three versions! It is Naomi Watts, playing Ann Darrow in 2005, who is the most alert to the sympathetically titanic-but-tender aspects of Kong's nature. All three actresses are of the same basic physical type, slenderly pretty but not big-bustedly bodacious as so many screen beauties have been. Kong gets to divest Fay Wray (with more sizzling effectiveness) and Jessica Lange of some of their clothes, but Kong displays less sexual curiousity about the Ann Darrow of Naomi Watts, the body of which actress, however, many human guys gladly would investigate very eagerly.<br /><br />All three versions of \\"King Kong\\" are worthy of this tale's primal (and primate) appeal, even if it is the 1933 and 2005 movies' spectacular effects, respectively for early sound film and for later cinematography, which most immediately draw the attention of mass audiences to them. I found the storm scene in the 2005 film very gripping, and realistic, too (and this comment comes from a former sailor who, indeed, was in such storms at sea) when the rusty old scow of a ship copes successfully with the heaving ocean waters as the captain and crew struggle to keep the ship afloat while navigating it free of Skull Island's jagged contours.<br /><br />All three films, the 1976 version included, well merit time spent watching them, as do the fascinating extra features that add so much to the value of the DVD issues of the 1933 and 2005 movies.(with an objectivity that is all the more dreadful for its calm) just how a victim's body really reacts when stabbed, whether fatally or otherwise.

B001IAP9MU|5.0|All of Diana Gabaldon's books are true works of art.  Of the thousands of books I've read her storytelling distinguishes her as an artistic craftsman capable of bringing to life complex and compelling stories that blur the mind's ability to reconcile that the story is fiction and not a personal account.

I expected a interesting book about a hidden tribe and their world away from ours, however, the book talks a little about the hidden tribe, a little about science behind running, a little about marathons, a little about shoe design and a little about alot of other things.
B000002KYK|4.0|I have been searching for this version of the Bladerunner soundtrack for years. I've finally found it and it is as good as Vangelis's version. In fact I like the New American Orchestra's version of \\"Memories In Green\\" better than the original Vangelis version. The New American Orchestra version is more jazzy and has that blues quality to it I like. Both versions are good and finally I have them both.

There are a lot of heavy riffs in here that are awesome, such as the opener \\"Still unbroken\\", \\"Comin' back for more\\" thanks in part to Medlocke's contribution as he did with Blackfoot. \\"Southern ways\\" is perfect, typical old Skynyrd , between \\"Sweet home Alabama\\" and \\"Am I losing\\". Rossington guitar is perfect for the slow ballads \\"Unwrite that song\\", just like he was on \\"Tuesday's gone\\". Thanks to Skynyrd for keeping up the spirit, it has worked for me, even thought all the loses they've had this year. Billy and Ean must be proud as much as the other brothers of the Skynrd family.
B0018Q0PXW|5.0|This novel is the story of a highly intelligent, emotionally sensitive young man, a New York financial analyst, who has a life-changing realization while on an assignment in Chile (where, as I recall, they had their own 9/11 in 1973).  The realization--or epiphany or moment of truth which the young man comes to--reaches him for many reasons as it could in anyone's life.  But this young Pakistani man--top of his Princeton University class--found his ideal employment with an American company, and he fit right in.  His college life, followed quickly by the right job, was the fulfillment of a dream.  Simple it seems, but you must read this novel to get the nuances, the buildup of tension.  It's not sound-bite reading for those who cherry-pick literary fiction.  Of course, if the setting is a cafe in Lahore, Pakistan, then you can guess that the young man, the narrator named Changez, lost his job.  But \\"how\\" he lost his job is the American story.  In many ways 9/11/01 is a \\"pretext\\" for this novel because this story could have happened at any time in recent world history; the story of failed dreams has been told by Thomas Hardy, Theodore Dreiser, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and many more novelists.    The Pakistani narrator is such a sensitive person that it's difficult not to think of him as also being the author, Mohsin Hamid.  I feel that to write this novel a person has to have lived it.  His sensitivity to the amount of flesh American women expose is profoundly touching as is his anguish over the fate of his family in Pakistan.      Regarding the craft of writing: Every scene is turned gently.  The fine points and nuances are so clearly realized.  There are moments of pointed irony in this novel that make it truly stunning.  If the American reader cannot read irony, then we are indeed a lost civilization; if we can't detect irony than it means our attention span is so short that we can't trace an idea over time and space.  One example would be the financial corporation's motto, \\"Focus on the fundamentals,\\" and how the notion of fundamentals resonates from the book's title through all the interpretations of what \\"fundamental\\" can mean and to whom.    Also, after this novel, no teacher of writing can tell his or her students to \\"show the reader, don't tell\\" for, with this novel, telling is showing.  What hurts most poignantly--for me--about Hamid's novel is the horrible truth I experienced when I realized that my fellow American, a soldier, could sit at a cafe table, ostensibly listening to the soul-searching of a sensitive, well-meaning young man and not feel anything.  That is the final implication: that there are people who feel nothing even when a well-spoken person bares the core of his life, and braves fear and paranoia to tell it so well.
B001UREJWM|4.0|I changed the name from \\"Heaven and Hell\\" to \\"Black Sabbath\\" on my itunes so it plays with my other sabbath albums - coming appropriately right after Dehumanizer.  This is a sick Black Sabbath album and it makes me wish the band had spent more time in the studio over the last decade and a half instead of farting around with Ozzy.  The album has a very similar sound to Dehumanizer, with the melodic sound of the Dio albums mixed with a heavier guitar sound and production more reminiscent of Iommi's solo album (around 2002 I believe).  However, the nu-metal leanings of that album are not found on The Devil You Know.  It is one of Sabbath's heaviest albums but sometimes a little bit plodding.  Every song has a distinctive riff and some inspired singing by Dio, although some are lacking a proper \\"hook\\".  However, there are way more good songs on this album than on Ozzy's last 3 albums!  It is clearly a group effort, and the product is a sweet collection of classic sabbath sludge riffs and Dio screaming about crazy stuff.  The songs sound raw and stripped down but loud and heavy like guitar drums and bass are supposed to sound.  It does not need to be dressed up with fancy production or weird sounds.  I hope there will be more albums in this vein in the future - working with Dio pulled Sabbath out of the Ozzy slump of the late 70s and the revolving door lineup problems of the late 80s-early 90s.  So maybe they will get back on track now.  Tony Iommi deserves to have control of the Black Sabbath name but he needs other strong musicians to make good albums like this one.  I hope that Geezer and Dio will stick around and that there will be more Heaven and Hell albums, or even better they will be able to release their next one as Black Sabbath.

B00003CXA2|1.0|Remember that intergalactic cruise ship in \\"Wall-E,\\"  with all those obese passengers hypnotized by their video screens?   I bet the video they were watching was \\"Forrest Gump.\\"    \\"Forrest Gump?\\"   An Orwellian trick?   Not sweet Forrest, who seems (on the surface at least) to personify all that is good and humble and admirable in the world.    Don't get me wrong:  Forrest is a good man.  But that doesn't mean that the film in which he stars is actually expressing \\"good\\" values.      In fact, \\"Forrest Gump,\\" fantastically realized as it is, is a cynical, calculating film.     Before you get upset, let's step back and define terms.   Can we agree that  in an ideal world, a film (like any work of art) will express a view of life which is truthful?   That viewers who experience that work will come away not only entertained, but also invigorated, strengthened, and enriched?       I raise this point because Hollywood producers have long understood the formula for manipulating mass audiences with over the top sentimentality.  Before Hollywood figured out the formula, the Greeks were already doing it.  Plato himself attacked the theatre because of its power to excite the senses and numb the mind.     At its best, a Hollywood film can be riveting and inspirational:   look at To Kill a Mockingbird,  Singing in the Rain,  or Mary Poppins, for example.    Why do I love those films and why do I exclude Forrest Gump from their ranks?      Because in all three cases (and innumerable other example could be cited) these films provoke in their audiences not not only wonder, but also the desire to interact with the world.   The children in \\"Mockinbird\\" experience injustice, but they also learn to accept \\"Boo Radley,\\" and, we presume, they will emulate their father as people who make a difference.  In \\"Singing in the Rain,\\" the plucky and talented prevail-- and will, we can expect-- spend a lifetime bringing joy to millions.   \\"Mary Poppins\\" goes away-- but not before Jane and Michael-- and the entire family-- are transformed-- and take their places in society, joining other Londoners in the park.     The \\"Forrest\\" effect, on the other hand, is the opposite.  We are encouraged (no: frightened into the decision) to stay at home.   Only a fool would follow the other characters into harm's way.  The big world is depicted as chaotic, dangerous, and generally not worth it.  And anyway, if Forrest is any example,  staying at home is a surer road to riches.       Don't get me wrong:  the idea of a wise fool is wonderful.  He appears in every culture.   But generally speaking, the story about the wise fool imparts wisdom.   If you look carefully at \\"Forrest Gump\\" you have 90% artificial flavoring. Because the outcomes in \\"Forrest Gump\\" are all rigged to reinforce the same idea:  city folk bad, Forrest, good.  Asking questions bad,  sitting on the porch swing good.    Now I love sitting on porch swings.   I've sat on them (or on hammocks, or meadows, or snowfields) in over 50 countries of this world.  And everywhere I've gone I've met good people.  And the more I know the world, the less it looks like the world of \\"Forrest Gump.\\"  Even in the worst zip codes of Los Angeles I've met people seeking to enrich their lives,  to interact with --and help-- others.  To change the world.    The Forrest Gump world is different.  The world is bad.   And hard to understand anyway.   So, again, going out there-- into \\"the arena\\" in Teddy Roosevelt's words-- just isn't worth it.    This is a dangerous idea, one that goes against the very fabric of what it means to be an American.  We are a nation of pioneers-- our future depends on our willingness to continue to be so.      And so Forrest represents a myth of failure, of decline.  And it reinforces the correctness of the decision to escape from our destiny by telling viewers they made the right decision not to get involved.  Not to know to much.  Maybe even...not to know anything at all.     In Ray Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" books are banned because they make people unhappy.   Why?  Because they tell uncomfortable truths.   Forrest Gump wouldn't fit that category, because it feels designed to tell certain people only what they want to hear.     Of course, this isn't the only film to do so.       In the market driven America of today,  a product is good if it reinforces the idea that the consumer is good.   Therefore, a movie is good if it makes the viewer feel good.      Fair enough.  Hollywood has always been mostly about straightforward entertainment, right?    Well, yes and no.     In the days of classic Hollywood cinema, audiences could feel good by identifying with John Wayne's eternal outsider, Humphrey Bogart's code of honor,  Scarlett O'Hara's astonishing persistence, and Fred Astaire's grace-- a wide variety of human characteristics-- all of which-- in their complexity-- somehow made audiences of the time feel better they were.  Maybe because they enlarged the scope of what was felt to be human.     In other words,  American consumers had the humility to identify with characters bigger, braver, and more foolish than they were themselves.  Characters who suffered and learned. This was, after all, the reason people exposed themselves to drama from the time of the Greeks.    In today's consumerist America, however, audiences don't want to get their hair messed up.  Characters like Scarlett and Sam Spade seem too far from home for most of us.  We want to identify with characters like Forrest Gump, who gets it all without even trying.   Or Good Will Hunting, the world's greatest street fighter, legal eagle,  nuclear physicist, sleuth,  lover, and who knows what else.  And all he needed to get the girl was Robin Williams weeping over him and uttering the magic words: \\"You're really good!\\"    Unlike Sam Spade, Scarlett O'Hara, Shane, or Terry Malloy,  Forrest and Will-- the heroes for the Wal-Mart American--  don't really learn through suffering.   They don't have to:  they're perfect just the way they are.   The only thing wrong in their worlds is that everybody else didn't know how perfect they were before they made the movie.   And by buying a ticket, the audience gets to take part in the canonization...of their own egos.      In other words, the FORREST GUMP consumer is a weak, selfish,  shallow, lazy narcissist, unable to bend his/her imagination to identify with characters who are flawed- and thus actually human.  In other words, this post-modern self-centered character would reject anything remotely human-- if somehow it got past the guards at the entrance to the shopping mall.      Naturally the Consumer Creature will call a movie \\"good\\" if it allows him/her to remain in the bubble of their shallowness.   Otherwise, it's \\"weird.\\"       I guess that's why Wal-Mart doesn't have a big selection of real books, or jazz, or classical music.  Or why Shakespeare, and Mark Twain,  and Thomas Jefferson are excluded from the minds of the worst generation in the history of the country.  Hunter Thompson called them a \\"generation of swine.\\"      Viewed in this way, Forrest Gump is the Moby Dick of this generation.   It is the white whale of shallowness, and, I'm afraid,  it will take us all to the bottom of the ocean.    Someday-- and maybe soon-- historians (perhaps in China, India, and Brazil-- countries where young people actually go to school to learn)  will view movies like this as a symptom of a culture in intellectual--and moral-- freefall.  They will say, that was when American stopped being a leader-- and started its descent.  (Of course, even if the U.S.A. morphs into a state of slave-workers for a future Chinese Empire, the workers drones will undoubtedly be told they are still number one, and they will go through life believing it.)    Meanwhile, the future historians will look at Forrest in the pantheon of great characters in literature (Lear, Hamlet, Ahab...Finn,  Gump) and marvel at the capacity of the human being to rise--- and to fall.     Forrest isn't, in fact, a character at all-- he's a ball of tricks designed to lure the audience's most infantile self inside.         This is fascism as consumer culture.    It doesn't matter how technically impressive the movie is, or that the scene where Forrest runs can make anybody cry.    This is the American version of \\"Triumph of the Will,\\"  the moment when it became practically illegal to have a mind.       By the way,  Robert Zemeckis' former writing partner, Bob Gale, co-creator of the BACK TO THE FUTURE series (the only films Bob Zemeckis should truly be proud of, except for USED CARS) accused Zemeckis of cynicism when he made FORREST GUMP.   Zemeckis claims he doesn't understand the accusation, and I believe him.   I don't think he understands what cynicism is, or how this film so perfectly embodies it.   And that puts him into the 95% of America that hasn't the slightest idea what it means actually to think.  And how criminal it is not to.  Especially when you have the power.           Again, to those of you who are offended by this comment,  why not stop to consider that maybe living a shallow life is even worse than being offended. In any case, history will judge you far more harshly than one writer possibly could.  Why not try to rouse yourselves from your slumber and join the world.  It's a lovely place.   Besides, do you really want to spend your life like those butterballs on the cruise space ship in WALL-E?     As someone who lived through the sixties, I can tell you that the film itself is an insult to all the men and women who struggled and shed their blood in that time of striving.  And their blood was not wasted!   Voting rights, civil rights, environmental protection-- these are the fruits of that struggle.      The proper heroes of a film about that time are the men and women who fought in Vietnam-- and against the war.  Who fought for civil rights, and against the haters.  Who reached for the moon-- and landed there.  Whoexperimented with new ways of creating society--and made discoveries which have enriched our lived.  Scientists and scholars and firefighters and farm workers and computer geeks and musicians.    Not a man-- sweet as he is-- who looked at it all and said none of it made sense.
B00015TNCU|2.0|Great Micheal Jackson songs but the disk clearly states that song 8 is Man in the Mirror but it is a random song and Man in the Mirror is nowhere to be found on the disk.  That was one of the songs I chose this for and not there.  BAD production!!

B002LK3DUQ|1.0|Thank goodness I rented this movie - I was tempted to buy it since I loved it at the theatre and couldn't wait to show it to my parents.  Unfortunately, my parents - like many people - are hearing impaired and there IS NO DISC MENU, NO SUBTITLES AND NO CAPTIONS.  WHAT WERE THEY THINKING??  Now there is huge segment of the population who will never be able to enjoy this film at home.  SHAME ON YOU, DISNEY!!

1419542273|5.0|My son's teacher recommended this version of the book and I am so pleased that we went with it. I particularly like the emphasis on the vocabulary words, with definition appearing on an opposite page in relation to where they actually appear in the text.  No matter how many times parents or teachers emphasize looking up an unknown word, many students do not do it. In a way this format helps and forces the students to learn the vocabulary that may appear on the SAT's.  I hope more stories are published in such a manner.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I feel so sorry for all the 1-star voters on here.  I was never a Star Trek guy and really started watching the Next Generation halfway through its run.  I'm sure the 1-Star people will say that I have no business then commenting on a Star Trek movie since I am not a full blown Trekkie.  However, for all the REASONABLE people out there I feel a need to add a little sensibility to the discussion.    The main points I see in the 1-Star comments is this idea that \\"This is not Star Trek\\" or \\"That just doesnt make sense\\" or \\"Oh, lets just use time travel to fix all the problems.\\"    O.K. first of all people this is a MOVIE!  A Science Fiction MOVIE!  None of it is based on anything real or logical.  Enjoy it for what it is, a fun entertaining movie.  I saw it 5 times in the IMAX (not IMAX) theatre.  The picture was fantastic and the sound was crystal clear and LOUD.  I really enjoyed the movie and I had no previous deep knowledge of Star Trek lore or the history of the fleet or phasers.  I may be black-balled from the inner halls of the Trekkie world, but get over yourselves people and just enjoy the movie.
B0029O08WA|4.0|For months I listened to the Twilight Soundtrack over and over, each time finding another new favorite song on the CD.   Maybe that will happen with the New Moon Soundtrack... maybe not.  But I do know there are some gems on this CD, like \\"Possibility\\" by Lykke Li. Haunting and can rip your heart out. Also Death Cab for Cutie, Bon Iver & St. Vincent and Hurricane Bells have great cuts too.  I'm sure as I listen more songs will grow on me.  In the meantime I'm real happy with these.
0385504225|5.0|Although I'd read the prior two books in this series, neither of them had the profound effect on me that this one did.  Having been a Mason for over 30 years, I found the book to be a vehicle for publicly expressing any number of things that have been so misconstrued and carried forward about our fraternity in a negative fashion for decades.      Dan Brown has taken a degree of painstaking research into our fraternity that is not only staggering but refreshingly delightful helping dispel so much of the \\"hocus-pocus\\" that abounds about the Masonic Lodge.  The comparisons so eloquently detailed in the book to Masonic symbolism then compared to all of the major religions of the world is nothing short of something that has been known for eons but cloaked in the public's perception.    Overall, Masonry has done a less-than-stellar job in defining itself over the last several decades, so accordingly, society has done it for us.  The book takes this task to bear and, considering that it is public knowledge that Dan Brown is not a Mason, it defines the very gravity of the organization.  By his own admission Dan Brown could not have written the book if he was a Mason.    The reviews here are equally divided from bad to good and it may very well be that they were generated from the same origin - expecting something based on his prior works.  Although understandable, it is probably not entirely fair from either side.  The Lost Symbol is a completely different work targeting a completely different objective.  To begin with, it is a book that focuses on sending a message about life and spiritualism itself - not religion.  For those expecting a plot liken unto his other works, it may indeed be somewhat disappointing.  For those that expected his furtherance in outlining the spirit within all of us, it proved to be magnificent.    Finally, the look back into the visions that our forefathers had for our great country and the mindset they had as evidenced throughout the book was captivating to me and whether the author was trying to send a lesson for all of us as citizens to consider it too a mystery.  I'm betting he was...
B00127RAJY|5.0|In fact, that's what I say to the tv everytime I finish this workout!  Obviously, I love it, but here's why...    First of all, it's fast, really fast -- both the pace and how quickly it goes by!  And it's hard, but I just finished my 7th day in a row, and boy, do I see a difference!  I'm actually becoming addicted...    Let me just say that I am NOT a consistent exerciser.  I go in and out of it, and the older I get (I'm 44), the more I'm \\"out\\" of it.  But, I'm an \\"apple\\" (darnit), and was just watching the tummy getting more and more jiggly, so I knew I had to do something, as the Weight-Loss Fairy has not visited my home lately.  Here's what I did to get motivated:  First, I kept looking in the mirror (difficult, but effective), and I put stickies that say \\"SHRED!\\" all over -- the fridge, the mirror and the front door.  Then I did the first one, hurt a lot, then the second one, hurt a little less, then the third one, and hurt no more.  On the fourth day, I could really see an improvement in my endurance (no, weight-loss is not the only benefit here)...and voila -- I'm doin' it!  (Another tip, keep a running tally of the workouts -- it's a motivator too!)    Caution -- this is not for the faint of heart -- be committed before you buy, but don't be afraid of it -- it's hard, but certainly not impossible.  Hope this helps, and good luck to all!

I own already the Spinosaur and now the Stegosaur (Just ordered the Allosaur too!)and the look of the skin and the design goes hand in hand with the best artist around. Of course, nobody knows how the dinosaur really looked like, but from the feeling of the skin to the looks of the figure it looks like you r looking @ a rendition of one of those dinosaur artist around. Storng plastic and very durable. Other collection worst owning is Carnegie collection.
B001W63DY6|1.0|I bought this DVD and I was very happy to receive it quickly. I went home to watch it but it did not work.

9056912445|5.0|Most players accumulate chess books like tribbles. But if you must own just one endgame book, this one is a very good candidate. A reference book like FUNDAMENTAL CHESS ENDINGS by Mueller & Lamprecht will contain all the positions in \\"100 Endgames...\\" plus very many others, but the didactic nature of this one and the fine selection by de la Villa will provide a sound footing for the improving player. Even very strong players I know have not mastered all the positions in this book, though they should.    De la Villa explains well and the material is laid out in such a way that with a modicum of effort, you will learn it. The selections are excellent. The pawnless Q vs R ending is not here, though, and since some R & pawn vs R endings lead to it, I would have included that one - either remove B+N vs lone K, or make it 101 Endgames You Must Know. But I quibble - this is a fine book.    If you go for a second endgame book, the above-mentioned FUNDAMENTAL CHESS ENDINGS would be a good choice as a reference manual. But start with this one.

Our old VHS copy is a better quality than this DVD. We thought that the DVD version would be much clearer and better sound quality. That couldn't have been further from the truth. We're very disappointed, and quite frankly disappointed that Amazon is even selling this DVD. Don't waste your money - worst quality DVD I've ever seen.

B002IYEQR4|5.0|i wont bore anyone with the specifics, the first two or so reviewers summarized everything you get perfectly. i would just like to echo how nice this collection is, the box is awesome (although mine did come a bit beat up since they shipped it in an envelope instead of a box). everything about this set screams quality.    i would also like to shake my head at all the re+ards that gave this 1 star because the price fluctuated...       Edit 11/19/09:  Zack Snyder has mentioned many times even before the original dvd/bluray came out that there will be a 'complete collection' out in time for the holidays. this was never hidden and this is not a 'double-dip' by any means.     the nice big box includes the motion comic (originally sold separately) in its own original blu ray case and a 2BR/1DVD beautiful fold out box with the new cut of the movie (the Director's cut with the pirate story inter-weaved just like in the comic), an extras BR (includes under the hood and more) and a DVD containing the Digital Download (which by the way expires December 2010).     basically the set brings together 3 separate releases (the Director's cut BR, Black Freighter BR, and Motion Comic BR) and some extras. it is also however missing the commentary from the first Director's cut release but includes 2 new ones.    i stand by that this is the best release of the movie, and a no brainer for true fans of the graphic novel. however i believe to get the super duper uber ultimate set you would need to also buy either the Director's Cut or the PS3 game edition as well.
B001F7MSG6|5.0|Not only is this a great movie to watch, but the feature on blu-ray is complimented with some of the best special features I've ever seen.  Aside from the horrible idea called U-control, the second disc is a sugar-coated geek-treat for those of us who love behind-the-scenes.  Guillermo Del Toro knows excatly what we want to see when we look through special features: Pre-Production, Production, and Post VIDEOS.  I'm tired of seeing special features on blu-rays with pages of reading.  I can go to wikipedia for that.  The director, I'm sure, watches a lot of other directors' work and admires their clips behind the camera.  So he made his own and made us fans all proud.<br /><br />Universal, on the other hand, needs to take advice from Del Toro.  Give us clips, not 5 movie tracks with different text and buttons coming out of every corner of the screen.  It doesn't matter if U-control is user-friendly or not.  The problem is that it is tedious and boring.  Give us the feature film with one or two commentaries to choose from.  Then gives us a picture in picture track to pay homage to the gift of blu-ray.  Then leave it alone and pack all the behind the scenes raw footage on disc two.  Nobody reads the fun facts while your movie plays, or rewinds the scene so he can catch every bit of his/her pre-visualization clip.  Make special features that people can enjoy, and people might actually start watching them.<br /><br />Now to the movie.  Sorry, I digressed on the extras, but the appreciation of this blu-ray mainly comes from the admiration of the effort the director took to make a great disc 2. Anyway, Hellboy 2 is way better than it's predecessor.  It's pacing, style, and story are all perfected in this sequel.  Did you think Hellboy 1 was missing something?  Well Hellboy 2 found it.  It found a more enjoyable villain, a richer color pallette, and much more.  The action has grown a lot more memorable in this one, due to choreography and CGI improvements.  I'm proud to see that Guillermo has found the balance between CGI and practical effects that we all longed for.  In addition to all these great improvements, the small things like humor and music compliment the movie even more, and make this Guillermo's most well-rounded film to date, besides Pan's Labyrinth.<br /><br />What is my favorite part of this movie you ask?  Probably the strong creativity it has.  Theres so many interesting creatures and scenery that you have never seen before within this movie.  Watch it again after you've seen it once, and I guarantee you, you will see something new.  Hellboy 2 is a beautiful film that does justice to the poorly received first film.  Most people weren't drawn in by the first movie, but by now, we're all ready for a sequel.  Thank you Guillermo for giving us a great film with a blu-ray that makes all others look impaired.that Guillermo has found the balance between CGI and practical effects that we all longed for.

B002LBKDYE|5.0|This is a documentary that everyone in America needs to see because food safety is an issue that directly affects us all, no matter who we are or where we live. The film begins with a flyover of the American heartland, zooming out through a painting of a farm house into a stroll down the supermarket aisle, with rows upon rows of products (47,000 in an average supermarket). All neatly packaged and arranged, they present an idyllic image of pastoral life that is completely incongruent with how food is produced today. Narrator, journalist, and UC Berkeley professor Michael Pollan begins, \\"the way we eat has changed more in the last 50 years than in the previous 10,000\\". Due to technological advances in mass production, mechanization, chemistry, and genetic engineering, the way food is produced now is vastly at odds with the fantasy of an agrarian America from the 30's to 50's that the food industry sells us on. A \\"veil\\" has been deliberately dropped between us and our food, because if we knew where our food came from, we wouldn't want to eat it anymore.<br /><br />But ignorance is not bliss. It can literally make you sick to your stomach. If the BSE (mad cow's disease) scares and frequent reports of E. coli contamination in everything from hamburger patties to spinach to lettuce to tomatoes in the last several years haven't given you pause about the food you put on your family's dinner table and the trust you place in the companies that supply it, then you definitely need to watch this documentary. Just as recently as November 1 came reports of yet another E. coli breakout (this time from Fairbank Farms, spurring a 500,000+ pound recall, with 2 reported deaths and 11 sick). Anyone who is concerned with the health of his/her family needs to be made aware of the potential risks involved with eating the foods produced by this dangerous system.<br /><br />Food today is less nourishing, less wholesome, and less safe than it was 50 or 60 years ago mainly as a result of large-scale mechanized production and factory-style agricultural practices that sacrifice quality for quantity and focus on making as much food as possible for the lowest cost (more fertilizers, more pesticides, high density feedlots, lower quality feed). We have cheaper, bigger, and faster foods and higher yields than ever before in human history, but such abundance comes at a cost to our health (increase rates of diabetes, obesity, and infection from food-borne pathogens), our land, and the dignity of private farmers and workers. Many of the foods we eat today are dangerously unsafe or unhealthy and this film explores the hidden human, health, and environmental costs of our modern industrial farming system. The topics covered include poultry, pig farming, cattle raising, corn, and being able to patent life (as Monsanto has done with seeds). Cattle, for example, are fed corn (because it is cheap and subsidized by the government), a food their bodies are not designed for, leading to dangerous build up of E. coli in their stomachs. In high density feed lots, they stand knee-deep in their own feces. Feces is everywhere and slaughtered at the rate of several thousands per hour in assembly-line slaughterhouses, it is very easy for the feces to enter the food chain. Ground beef is mixed with beef from thousands of other cows, exponentially increasing the chance of pathogen introduction. If you didn't know from recent news reports of cattle processors using ammonia to kill bacteria, now you do. Do you want to be eating ammonia in your hamburger patty?<br /><br />If you are an educated food consumer, you will already know much of the information presented here from reading the numerous books on the food industry or watching such films as \\"[[ASIN:B000MEYKAU Fast Food Nation]]\\" (which Eric Schlosser also produced), \\"[[ASIN:B0002OXVBO Super Size Me]]\\", or PETA videos on animal abuse. This is an excellent and highly informative documentary that all consumers should watch. If thereis one criticism, it's that the film tries to cover too many topics within its 90 minute runtime and sacrifices some depth for the sake of a more encompassing view of the entire food industry. It ends on a positive note, and even puts the oft-maligned Walmart in a good light, showing their buyers as being responsive to the demands of its consumers. The more we know about how our food is made, the more we can start demanding more wholesome, safer foods and changing the way these large multinational corporations operate. With the growth of organics and chains like Whole Foods and Trader Joe's, the corporations are listening.that the film tries to cover too many topics within its 90 minute runtime and sacrifices some depth for the sake of a more encompassing view of the entire food industry.

Helene Hanff writes her letters from New York City to London to bookshop that deals in used books and happily ships them to her.  She responds by shipping them food and nylons in the early 50's, a time when England was still very much recovering from the war with little help in recovery (especially from the US).<br /><br />So glad I finally got the opportunity to read it, and Ms Hanff would approve;  I only paid .88 cents!

0061730327|4.0|Disclosure - I'm married to an engineer. So I've often heard discussions about the best schools for engineers, the best countries to find an engineer in, the difference between a 'born' engineer and a person who goes into engineering as a career choice.  The Boy Who Harnessed The Wind is firmly in the 'born' camp. There is no doubt that William Kamkwamba has a scientific mind. Few boys could teach themselves the concepts of electrical engineering and then hold complete faith in their ability to execute a practical application of those concepts. This story is being sold as inspiring, because of the dream William has and his determination to realize it. What spoke to me even more was the strength of his family. Without his cousin, his friends, and most importantly his father, William would not have been able to pursue his dream. It is the ability of his family to support each other despite (to a western reader) unimaginable hardship that allows William's inborn talents to emerge. The early story of William's family and his childhood (Who knew they play \\"America & Vietnam\\" in Africa?) carry you through the involved descriptions of his creations.<br /><br />I dropped one star from my review because some of those descriptions will drag on for the non-science minded. An explanation of the differences between AC and DC currents is never going to hold my interest, no matter how compelling the speaker. Additionally, some of the 'voice' shifts from what seems to be William's authentic speech to an older 'voice' someone with a bit more distance and perspective than William likely has at his current age. That is the pitfall of a joint collaboration where only one member of the team serves as narrator. The ending feels a bit rushed - you want to know more about William's experiences as he was brought into the community of scientists. (There's a pitfall in making him appear less accomplished than he is, of making the story into one about a country mouse in the city, so I do understand why this part of his tale is so short. ) That you have the desire to stay with William through the entire tale, from his birth through all the descriptions of his construction process to the end speaks both to the power of the writer and William Kamkwamba.<br /><br />Well worth the time, and an excellent holiday gift book.hy this part of his tale is so short. ) That you have the desire to stay with William through the entire tale, from his birth through all the descriptions of his construction process to the end speaks both to the power of the writer and William Kamkwamba.

This is an interesting way to learn some of the history behind punctuation and highlights just how much we miss during the essential, early school years. I highly recommend this book to any one with a sense of humor and a love of learning.
B002L9N4DS|4.0|I love this film and just had to get the Blu-Ray version. It looks crisp and clean as you would expect, but for some strange reason, the rock music soundtrack has vanished. The film's normal soundtrack is there, but when the rock music is supposed to kick in (Vietnam for instance), you hear about half a second then silence. I have to say that it totally ruined the film for me and my wife, as this was such an integral part of the emotions that this film can evoke. I do have this film on normal DVD and I compared the two, just to be sure. I will be returning this copy to Amazon, and will let you know what the outcome is. I wonder if this a single disc fault, or a fault in the copying process for all these discs?

B001UV4XTC|5.0|I suspect there is a chance that years from now, when we look back at the careers of the Coen Brothers, A SERIOUS  MAN may be considered to be among their finest work.  This is not to say that it is their most enjoyable movie, but it is a marvel of tone.  It is at once (not alternately) a comedy and a serious meditation on life, morals & ethics.  I frequently found myself laughing out-loud  while at the same time cringing with dismay.  It's an unsettling movie, full of dread...and yet full of joy.  The joy of seeing a film with pitch-perfect performances, great cinematography & art direction and a razor-sharp script.      I love the Coens, but even I must admit that some of their comedies are allowed to get flaccid and a little silly.  INTOLERABLE CRUELTY, THE LADYKILLERS and BURN AFTER READING had many joys...but no gravitas.  Remember the ending of THE LADYKILLERS?  It was actually quite bleak, with the crooks of the title failing utterly and in the end, joining a trashheap on a garbage ship.  Yet my feeling at the end was mostly bemusement.  In the Coens more serious work, such as NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, there is frequent comedy playing just below the surface...but it becomes less and less as the film builds to a relentless conclusion.  In BARTON FINK, the comedy gives way to drama and then to sheer, incomprehensible madness that left me, for one, mostly angry that the film had become quite so obtuse.  (Or maybe it was me who became obtuse.)    A SERIOUS MAN never stops being funny.  It also ends portentously, but the themes are quite crystal clear up through the final moment.      In some ways, we could see this film as a modern-day take on the story of Job.  We meet physics professor Larry Gopnik, just as his tidy, middle-class life begins to fall utterly to pieces.  He earns a modest living that allows him to keep his wife and two older kids in modest comfort in an early example of a subdivision (the film is set in 1967).  The kids are modestly troubled teens,they squabble, take Hebrew school less seriously than it should be...but there isn't anything too outside the range of acceptability.  They are a Jewish family living among gentiles, and this causes some dis-ease...but the Jewish community in their Minnesota town is strong and supportive.  In short, Larry is living a fairly normal life.  He's a meek man, slow to anger and slow to any shows of passion.  He believes there are right ways and wrong ways to do things...but he's always a tiny bit befuddled too.  It may be 1967, but he still seems perhaps a bit stuck in the `50s.    One day, a foreign student who is failing his class comes to him and is quite upset about his grades.  When Larry declines to reconsider, he is later delivered a hefty envelope full of cash...a bribe.  While he will not accept the bribe...he doesn't quite give the money back either.  In fact, he firsts throws out the idea of turning the boy in...but the boy threatens to turn HIM in for taking a bribe.  It becomes a hilariously circular argument, and more out of confusion that anything, Larry backs away from making a decision.    Then his wife announces she is leaving him.  She has a new man in her life, and she wants Larry to move out.  She's unclear on why this event has taken place...but Larry, ever the meek pussycat, goes along.  Unfortunately, his wife also obliges him to take along his very odd brother Arthur (Richard Kind), a social outcast who clearly suffers from both medical and mental ailments which today we might address, but in 1967, the family simply endures.  So Larry & Arthur live in a horrific motel room together...and Larry's life gets worse from there.  His kids get into trouble.  He comes to fear he may not make tenure.  His money woes increase.  And it gets worse and worse.    Larry will eventually be put to severe moral & ethical trials (Job-like again?)...and the film dares to suggest that God is taking a very serious look at Larry's case.  In fact, it's been a long timesince a movie looked seriously at the role of religion in the lives of ordinary people who have an ordinary, non-extremist belief in religion.  A belief that embraces the role of religion (in this case, Judiasm) not only in the moral life but in the everyday social life as well.  These folks attend synagogue routinely, and as naturally as they draw breath.  Larry meets all the criteria of what most of us would call a \\"good\\" person...yet he is put through trials that would break many men.  Will they break him?    The movie is nearly perfectly acted.  Stuhlberg should be receiving Oscar buzz...although the movie has underperformed and I doubt he'll be remembered come nominating time.  Yet he is matched by everyone else in the film.  The Coen's are always great at casting folks who LOOK like the character they are playing.  So, even minor roles make an impact...we see the person for 3 seconds in extremely close-up, and we already have a pretty good idea of what kind of person this will be.  The movie, as with all Coen films, looks fabulous.  Art direction and costume direction are flawless and what is remarkable, they are beautiful too, even though all we're seeing is suburban Minnesota in the `60s.  Not exactly a setting most would call breathtaking...and yet it feels rich and complete.    As I indicate before, the film does not VEER from funny to serious.  It gives us both at once.  This is a testament to how well all elements were \\"playing together.\\"  The script is revealing and sharp...no wasted words, and I mean that almost literally.  Every sentence uttered has meaning in either revealing character or revealing plot.  And the Coen's know when to let silence do the talking too.  The direction is rock-solid, indicated by the unity of approach that the actors use.  I think the mostly unfamiliar faces in the film allow it to obtain a believability that the casting of a \\"star\\" might have watered down.  The fact that the Coen's grasped this shows how committed they were to making the BEST film possible, not necessarily the most lucrative.  I've heard that the film is inspired by their own childhoods and the people they knew.  This is necessary to know, but it does help illuminate what I can't help but feel is an extra touch of loving care from these two artists who always lavish their films with so much attention.    While this is not a feel-good film by ANY stretch...it left me feeling joyful nonetheless, because it is a great example of film craftsmanship at its finest.  Much to my surprise, this film ranks high among the best of the year.
B0025KVLUG|4.0|With only four new Beatles songs \\"Yellow Submarine\\" has never really been like a real album. The title track dates back to 1966 and \\"All You Need Is Love\\" was out on a single in 1967. Side two of the original album was orchestral music written by George Martin, for the cartoon project of the same name.<br /><br />In addition to the four new songs several older Beatles songs were included in movie. The soundtrack version of \\"Yellow Submarine\\", released in 1999, distinguishes itself by having the bulk of those numbers in place of George Martin's orchestral music, which I guess most Beatles fans in reality can easily do without. Moreover, the songs on the 1999 version had been remixed and remastered, which at the time was really a revelation of sound. The somewhat primitive stereo effect here was also markedly improved.<br /><br />Now we have the new 2009 remastered version. Comparing with the first CD version from 1990 is like comparing day and night. Sonically it is a pleasure to listen to this new version.<br /><br />Whether it is also an improvement over the 1999 version is probably more a matter of taste. Personally, I think it is unfortunate that the opportunity to enhance the stereo effect has not been exploited. The 1999 release showed quite clearly that this would have been a vast improvement.<br /><br />Whether one prefers George Martin's Orchestra music over eight previously released Beatles songs, is probably also a matter of taste; again, I think 1999 release takes the plug at that, considering that it contains all the Beatles songs included in movie soundtrack, apart from  \\"A Day in the Life\\".<br /><br />Among the four \\"new\\" tracks on the album, I would consider \\"Hey Bulldog\\" and \\"It's All Too Much\\" as classics.
0143038583|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I learned a lot about, well, corn--the economics, the health issues and the politics all involved in growing and selling corn.  I thought this book was well researched and I think that Mr. Pollen did a great job of truly involving himself in the experience.  I mean, he spent a week, busting his butt on the farm, living and working with a complete stranger who, although well meaning, is a bit out of the bell curve.      I have to agree with another review regarding the meat.  I am a non-red meat eater but I do eat poultry, eggs, and dairy.  I didn't think that he was as sensitive as he could have been to those that choose a vegan or vegetarian lifestyle.    I would highly recommend this book.  I can't wait to read the Botany of Desire.
B000P12LWY|5.0|This is Cable TV at its best! The acting is simply awesome and the costumes ....so many of 'em all different just blow my mind. The scenery in Ireland simply breathtaking with green green green everywhere.Mr Meyers make for a perfect King.....only Peter O'Toole (in his younger years) could have done better.  The actrees who played Catherine of Aragon looks the part of a Queen....she is sensational. There is sex, as in Season 2, but done quite tastefully though quite graphic. I liked this better than Season 2. though both are well-worth the money..  BUT the variety of outfits just blows my mind.
B002VECMA4|4.0|While not a great or meaningful movie in any way (although I suspect some of the folks involved thought it would be), THE M EN WHO STARE AT GOATS is a hoot, fueled by George Clooney's ready-to-be-patented, Coen Brothers inspired lunacy.    Constructed in a needlessly hodge-podge fashion, we follow the journey of the somewhat whimpy journalist who stumbles upon a crazy-enough-to-maybe-be-true story (Ewan McGregor).  McGregor has more or less assigned himself to a middle-east beat, because he wants to prove to his estranged wife that he's an exciting man.  Unfortunately, he is actually quite a coward, and when he latches on to a story that takes him into Iraq, his need to follow the story is nearly outweighed at every turn by his great fear of being killed.    The story he follows is embodied by Clooney, a mad but compelling figure who has played a part, for decades, in the US government's secret program to develop psychic powers in soldiers.  This program was proposed, sometime during the Vietnam era, by Jeff Bridges, a soldier who was allowed to \\"infiltrate\\" hippie culture in search of some new approach to war.  He comes back with the idea of using psychic powers to affect \\"peaceful\\" outcomes in conflicts.  He isn't against war, per se...he's against the idea of war needing to actually KILL anything.  Clooney is an early recruit to the program, and he shows a great deal of promise.  Later, he meets his match in the only other person with psychic powers to rival his, Kevin Spacey...a soldier who seethes with loathing for his fellow man, particularly the cowardly bunch who run this project.  He believes that the powers can be used to stop the hearts (literally) of the enemy.  Naturally, the government sees more value in this, and the program Bridges has crafted becomes corrupted, and Bridges is disgraced.    Decades later, McGregor follows Clooney on a voyage through Iraq, as Clooney believes he has been \\"called\\" to Iraq to journey to an as yet unknown location for anunknown purpose.  McGregor sees just enough to believe that Clooney just might be for real...but he also sees enough to really worry that he is just following a dangerous nutcase.    The movie is breezy and off-kilter.  Clooney has done some of his wackiest work for the Coen Brothers (particularly in O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU and the recent BURN AFTER READING).  He brings that level of goofy energy to MEN WHO STARE, and the level  to which you will enjoy this film is probably going to be determined to a large degree by how much you like seeing Clooney do this particular shtick.  I happen to enjoy it...not only is it self-effacing (which I always like to see in mega-stars) but it allows Clooney to let out the mischievousness that always seems to bubble just below his surface...and to suffuse it with a touch of melancholy.  These aren't GREAT performances, per se...but to me, they are fun.    Bridges gives us much the same attitude he used in his classic role as The Dude in BIG LEBOWSKI (another Coen Brothers film), but at least his character here has a bit more ambition.  Spacey is merely adequate in his underwritten, generic role...although he does have one funny bit when he inadvertently ingests some LSD (although I always think the depiction of other people's drug-trips is less amusing for the viewer than for the actor).  McGregor, despite a barely passable American accent, is an amusing foil for Clooney...and the scruff of unshaven beard his sports makes him seem more rugged than he has in years.  I keep thinking that there is still the perfect film role for this actor...one that gives him full freedom to show off his talents (TRAINSPOTTING)...but also garners wide public notice.    Director Grant Heslov, a Clooney friend and a fairly inexperienced director, does the film no favors.  The pacing needs to be brisk throughout, but it goes from breezy to leaden almost from scene to scene.  Some bits simply are allowed to go on just a beat or two too long.  And in the final scenes, when the film wants to be poignant and perhaps wants to make some statement about war or at least, our current wars...it just sort of fizzles out.  As with many comedies, all the best bits are early on.  I believe in some ways, Heslov and Clooney may have been trying to create something like a 2nd Gulf War version of THREE KINGS, but that magnificent feature that followed the 1st Gulf  War was a singularly brilliant piece of filmmaking that crackled with true creativity in every frame.  THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS is a fun, uneven but ultimately worthwhile trifle in comparison.    (As a New Mexico resident, I'd also like to point out that the movie was filmed in large part in New Mexico, particularly at White  Sands National Monument.  Therefore, the scenery is a cut above average!)

B002MW50KO|3.0|I love Bob Dylan. I grew up listening to him. His sound is as familiar to me as the voices of my brothers and sisters. I am also a big fan of Christmas. I don't believe that there are many people who feel so strongly about both... So, I imagined that I would cherish this record, that it would bring something fresh to the season. I will play it during the holidays regardless of the fact that my Jewish husband (who also is a Dylan fan) turns his nose away in a questioning snub and that my grown children (big Dylan fans as well) wonder, as they listen closely for something to appreciate, whether it's a joke. It doesn't matter to me whether the guy is sincere, or that he is a Jewish man singing Christmas carols, or that they are are not unusual or inspired- in fact I think the inspiration is that he is just singing- touching in to a tradition that is embedded, for better or worse, into our culture like marriage... amalgamating himself to it to forge some understanding. I might be making that up- but it is exactly what I have always loved about Bob Dylan. He get's us all thinking. And talking.    Does that tell you anything about whether or not I like the CD? I look forward to having him here for Christmas.
B001R0KH3W|5.0|It is a spectacular show. Stevie Wonder made me feel really happy for being in this planet. Two hours and fourteen minutes of love and soul. Amazon should have a 6 stars, maybe more, maybe 10 stars. I will never forget last night when I saw Stevie Wonder at last. Luis
B000053VAF|1.0|This film assumes to be satricial and comedic. However, the inaccuracies in the relating of history and theological doctrine overwhelm any statement or humor this movie attempts to portray.

B000AP04OM|5.0|After appearing as the lead in \\"Mary Poppins\\" Julie Andrews solidified herself in pop culture and the American consciousness as the nanny and Nun Maria in \\"The Sound of Music\\". Ask any film buff what one of their favorite films are and this one always comes near the top. Winning multiple Oscars including Best Picture of 1965 \\"The Sound of Music\\" is one of the best movie musicals of all-time. Featuring Canadian-born Christopher Plummer in the role of a naval commander who is the widowed father of seven children, the film is equally known for its beautiful soundtrack and memorable songs. Based on the stage play of the same name, \\"The Sound of Music\\" is one of those rare films that has grossed over a billion dollars since it debut at the boxoffice. This particular DVD set comes with a slew of bonuses including behind the scenes featurettes and a splendid audio commentary by Julie Andrews herself. Both Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer recall the shooting of the film together and perhaps the greatest part about the bonuses is the beautiful reunion of all seven kids now adults discussing their memories on \\"The Sound of Music\\". It is wonderful that all seven actors still remain friends to this day. Lastly, there is an old screen test of a very young Mia Farrow who tried out for the part of the oldest child. Simply, you will enjoy the many multiple viewings you will have when buying this film. A film for the entire family.
6305428042|5.0|This has been a FAVORITE movie of our family since it came out.   The story is fun, the acting is great, and you can really watch it at any  time, not just for Halloween. Bette Midler is priceless in this film!

B002IYEQR4|4.0|How many people have rated this product with any knowledge of what it's really about?    Seriously.  I read reviews about this movie going from long and boring to even longer and more boring.  One \\"person\\" even wrote about how Watchmen ruined the idea of superheroes they grew up with as kids.  Are they really this stupid?    The answer is yes.  Never buy a movie you know nothing about.  And Watchmen really is not for everyone.  I saw it as a pretty accurate interpretation of the superhero mythology in a world much closer to our own.    I read the graphic novel and loved it.  I am a comic book fan.  This movie did disappoint my friends, but not me, and it disappointed them because they also read the comic and wanted a closer interpretation.    Snyder did change some things and added his own creative spin and interpretation.  All directors do this.      I really wouldn't have bothered writing a review, but some of the people rating this movie really have no idea what they are talking about (and sucked is spelled s-u-c-k-e-d not SUKD, this only makes you look moronic).    Do a little research, maybe read the comic if you read them, I always think you should give something a chance.  This isn't a movie the average consumer can just buy on a whim.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|The product itself is of good quality.  My family and I sometimes find it difficult to find appropriate shows on TV, we like the tone and message of this series. I would recommend it to anyone of any age. Delivery was prompt.
B00000E2WH|4.0|These performances have the power and polish we expect from Von K and the Berliners.  My only gripe is that DGG is so stingy. Only 42 minutes of Music. Throw in the En Saga at about 9 minutes, or the Karelia Suite. It can be done!

B00122EX4Y|5.0|Each number uniquely shows the talents of Mark and Emmylou.  Mark flavors each song with his peerless guitar work and folksy voice, while Emmylou enhances the vocals with her wonderful interpretations.  It is interesting to hear both musicians exploring their folk roots, after joining up from such diverse musical polarities.

B00005N6KG|3.0|They are good but I found them very uncomfortable to my ears. Also, there is no sound isolation and everyone around you can hear what your are listening to. The good thing about them is that they are ultra light and as per the money spent, the sound quality is also Ok.
B001IAP9MU|5.0|Just when you think Diana has given you all she's got, she gives you more! I can't put this series down!  Her ability to make you believe you are there.. you can almost smell & taste it!  The history, and the beauty that is Jamie & Claire - people you'd so like to know! - and now Roger and Brianna come into the mix..  She continues to amaze me, surprise me. The intricate tales she weaves connecting and throughout each book!  She has the ability to mix the ordinary with the extraordinary (time travel) and make it believable!  She can make you laugh, and  bring you to tears (Jamie & Brianna Meeting... wow).  It has been 20 years since an author has been able to touch me in this way. I thought great fiction was dead!  This series (Outlander..) is number one on my Christmas list for all my friends.  I just read Echo in the Bone (7th Book) and cannot  wait for the next book!

B0025T65GC|5.0|Dev didn't seem to want this album to be his end-all masterpiece chock-full of amazing technicality.instead he chose to have the lyrics and singing be at the forefront of this release,and he lets the music gently carry the messages along,at times hinting at blowing up the spot with heaviness,but he restrains himself.it's a welcome change i'd say;like listening to something off of a light rock station that has more content.there is one song that is a bit repetitive,but it's still good--the rest are very personal,relaxing,and cool!
B0024FAR5M|5.0|this is a fantastic series that prior to recieving this box set, i had only heard about (plus the one review in a Harley mag my g/f had bought me).  did not disappoint.  think soppranos on a v-twin.  action, drama, harleys.  the extras let out little secrets about the bikes, cast etc.  it was all good.  sit on the couch next to a six pack of coronas and enjoy.
B000SEFM6K|5.0|This is the first book I have read by this author but I know it won't been the last.<br />A mystery, wrapped in beautiful language that will hold the reader captive to the last page.<br /><br />The story starts in foggy London and weaves a tale of intrigue and mystery with richly descriptive characters.<br />Just when you think you have figured everything out, the trail goes cold.<br /><br />If you want to get lost in a good read, then this will fulfill every expectation. I didn't want it to end.
B001GAOY5U|3.0|You know you have seen two or three previous versions of the Journey to the Center of the Earth. Well here we go again. This time the journey is in HiDef Blu-ray. That fact alone made me want to watch the video, plus the movie is in 3D! The movie is ok. It comes across as a Part II for the older versions. In the beginning of the movie the 3D special effects are nice.  However, I got a headache about half way through. 3D needs to be improved. Get rid of the colored glasses. I think if you watch the movie in 2D you will enjoy it just as much.
0810983915|5.0|My 9 yr. old grandson has read all of his books and always can't wait for the next one. I informed him yesterday that the movie is coming out April 2, 2010 and he actually jumped off the couch and was screaming Yes, Yes, Yes!  He wrote down the date and stuck it on the refrigerator so he won't forget! If you want your child to enjoy reading, I recommend all of these books highly!
B002T9H2L0|3.0|good-emotional story. however the QT dialogue in subtitles got old after 30 minutes. Mike Meyer's cameo is awesome.
B002V0WN2K|5.0|I have been eagerly awaiting this CD release!  I went out and bought it here at Amazon the first day it was out.  I haven't stopped listening to it since then.  I think this CD has a similar sound to the New Jersey CD.  The one thing I was surprised about was that there were not any true ballads.  Although the ballads have been a favorite of mine, I felt this CD was perfect without them.  Their sound is still truly unique and I believe it always will be.  I think this CD is true to the Bon Jovi vision and incorporates current themes into their music.  I love \\"We Weren't Born to Follow\\", I think it stands for how many people feel with everything going on in the world right now.  I specifically love \\"Superman Tonight\\".  This song is the only one that comes close to being a ballad and it is a great song.  I think the entire CD is great and that \\"true\\" Bon Jovi fans will find that it is a true Bon Jovi CD that has changed and grown as the band themselves have.  So, I highly recommend this CD if you are an avid Jovi fan.  My daughter, my mother, and myself truly love this CD as much as the rest of them.  I have loved every CD Bon Jovi has created and will continue to love them all, because they are Bon Jovi and what the band puts out on their CD's is what they want to say to us as fans and being a loyal fan, I love to listen!!!!  Way to go guys, another fabulous CD...

B000002KBD|4.0|I bought this CD for one song=-- \\"I'll Be Your Lover Too\\". I'd heard it at the end of a TV show or movie, and couldn't believe I'd never heard it before. I'd always liked Van Morrison, but was on the young side to be overly familiar with his songs unless they were played on the radio a lot.<br /><br />\\"I'll Be Your Lover Too\\" blew me away, and it's worth the purchase price just for that song. Throw in several other great numbers on this CD and you've got every reason to buy it.<br /><br />The versatility of the selections on this CD is amazing.His unique style and fearless approach to being different is so refreshing.
B002K0WBY6|5.0|Sandra Bullock, Ryan Reynolds and Betty White made this romantic comedy one of the best DVDs of today.  It was not only funny but had a funny story to it.  Everyone will enjoy this and look forward to more buys from Amazon.com.

B000OLGCI4|5.0|I honestly belive before Disney went all CGI they were the greatest producers of family favorites, and I remember that at the end of all the old Disney Movies I watched as a kid there was a message to be learned like this one THE JUNGLE BOOK. The story of Mogli a orphaned man child that is trying to find his place in the world and be friends a loveable bear name Baloo who helps teach him that all he needs are the bear necessities eventually he finds that what he needed all along was confidence and when he has finally faced it and has it he goes to where he belongs. This is by far one of the greatest movies of all time and should be shared by families every where.
B001OQCV24|3.0|Other than a few continuity issues and some obvious problems with geography, I thought the movie was OK. The special effects are worth seeing on \\"the big screen.\\"  The actors performed well so one can't hold them responsible for the failures of the finished product.     I have to say that I liked the overall story, but can't get past the ending vacation early and still being \\"late for work\\" scene.    What time of the year is all this supposed to be taking place again? If it's not in December then it might explain the Mosquitoes (and other elements missing or existing as expected), but we all know that 2012 is an election year and that is one element that would play a part regardless of which month this is supposed to take place in that year.      I guess I shouldn't have expected much considering the other films Roland Emmerich has done. At least I can say he seems consistent.

B001I82RVS|3.0|I watched this movie last night and I am not really sure what to say about it. First of all it is completely, absolutely absurd. In one scene a man get his legs chopped off and the geysers of blood that stream forth from the stumps are strong enough to make him fly, like with a jet pack around the room continuing the attack. In another scene the Tokyo police coroner have a gun that shoots body parts, like fists which can knock pepole out or hands to strangle pepole. The gore to, and it is allot, and I do mean allot of it is so over the top crazy that it becomes mote a comedy than a horror movie. They use cheap theater blood by the bucket full in this movie. And in a way this is good, as the way it is the movie is campy and entertaining, but had the gore been more realistic, with so much of it as there is, then the movie would really be disturbing.<br /><br />The story of Tokyo Gore Police is that the police have become a privately owned company, some years ago pepole called engineers started popping up, there are pepole that when harmed, the harmed body parts mutates into a weapon or melds with some nearby weapon creating quite dangerous, cyborg like mutants who run amok in Tokyo. Ruka is the police chief's adopted daughter and she is an expert engineer hunter. What follows is a bloody science fiction story like with Ruka killing engineers with various brutal weapons while she at the same time tries to solve her read father's murder. The story starts off rather ok but descends into total chaos towards the end of the movie.<br /><br />Visually the movie is grotesque and dream like. Some of the creature design is quite creative. Like the snail girl, the visually comes together nicely to form this dark, bloody future world where a brutal private police force are judge, jury and executioner and have made killing criminals into a fun activity. Every now and then are sown a in setting commercial, perhaps a homage to Robocop, with things like wrist cutting knives, or advertisement for a online game where pepole take control of some murder instrument over the internet to kill a restrained criminal. Murder is treated as fun and this really creates a weird, bloody world.<br /><br />But really this is a movie one can not really analyze to much. It is just plain entertainment for a gore fan. This is a good movie to watch late a night you just want senseless entertainment and do not want to have to think to much. I found the movie fun and entertaining but a bit to long. Towards the end of the movie I had gotten my fill of paper thin plots and senseless violence and found myself checking how much of the movie was left and hoping it was not to long.

0439023491|4.0|This sequel to the Hunger Games is nearly as riveting as the first.  A small amount of the novelty of this kind of book has worn off, since Collins published the first book, but Collins introduces enough new elements to keep you, once again, on your toes throughout the novel.<br /><br />Halfway through the book, I began to think that it was repeating itself.  Yeah, yeah, she's going into the arena again.  But it turns out to be totally different!  Don't stop reading when it seems like the series is just repeating itself, because Collins is about to throw you a curve ball!

Cliff the therapist was by far my favorite.  Being from the Phila/South Jersey area and and Eagles fan, the book has a great connection there.  This book would make a great movie and I found myself thinking about which actors would fit the characters.

B000069KIZ|5.0|These performances are excellent, first rate renditions of music many of us love more than we can say. I admit, I didn't expect that much. I was rather biased against Bohm because of his Nazi history (Google it if you want to know more). But I also knew of Bohm's long association with the Wiener Philharmoniker, that the VPO knew he must be OK, and I knew there must be something to these performances and this relationship with a very great orchestra. I love that orchestra, and I love their renditions with my favorite Brahms' conductor, Carlo Maria Guilini, whom, most of us will admit, is himself no slouch on Brahms. I rate these performances right up there with Guilini's.     In my judgment, Bohm's is far more authentic Brahms than von Karajan's Berlin performances. In my opinion, Bohm is a better conductor on Brahms than either von Karajan or Furtwangler. In fact, let me say it. Judging by these performances, I rate Bohm on the highest level. Better than Klemperer? Better than Berstein? Better than Haitink?  Barbirolli?  Jochum? Those guys were really good. But Bohm is on a par with Giulini for me on Brahms. That is the highest level. I am pleased to find another conductor that truly \\"gets\\" Brahms. And an orchestra that does too!    Bohm deserves praise for these performances. These are great performances played by a great orchestra. Bohm generally sketches a wide palette without doodling, allows the Philharmonic to wax eloquently and naturally on music they love, and gives generous and obvious definition to music he obviously loves too. In fact, as I listened to the 2nd and 3rd and 4th symphonies, I couldn't detect too much difference from the Giulini Philharmonia or Wiener Philharmoniker renditions in my library. What excellent performances. Again, thanks to DG for releasing this joy to Brahms lovers. What a pleasure to hear a Brahms lover conduct this music.    Friends, there aren't too many this good. I would rush to order them at wonderful prices from Amazon today. There aren't too many like this.
0060872675|5.0|I teach Children's Literature on the college level, and I've recently become a Pratchett fan. I'm not sure if very small children would like this book, but I read it to myself, out loud, twice.  Giggling madly.    Yes, it's a Discworld book, and it probably helps to have read those.  But it's really a parody of children's picture books.  Anyone who has had to read *Goodnight Moon* or *Are You My Mommy* over and over and over every single night would probably find this funny; anyone who has read a child's picture book and thought \\"hey, YEAH, why are all these books about sheep?  Little Ralph here has never, ever seen a sheep, and isn't going to.\\"      A word on the illustrations:  I enjoyed these.  Melvin Grant uses a somewhat realistic technique for the \\"real\\" characters--Sam Vimes, the beggars, the trolls, Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler.  It's more realistic than Paul Kidby's fantasy-style illustration, but it works in contrast to the \\"baby book\\" illustrations of *Where's My Cow*, the book within the book, which uses simple outlines and a color palette reminiscent of *Pat the Bunny.*      I'm going to bring this in to my Children's Lit class next quarter.

B001DJ7PR8|4.0|I bought VCB on DVD a couple of months ago, but delayed watching it as I wasn't sure what to make of the mixed reviews and also because I wasn't sure if my wife (who generally doesn't like Woody Allen films) would enjoy it. I needn't have worried because VCB is easily Woody Allen's best film comedy since Husbands and Wives. Everyone in our household enjoyed it immensely.    When I say 'comedy' I don't mean mildly amusing, I mean laugh-out-loud funny. Admittedly it does take a while to get into its stride, but the scenes between Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz in the second half of the film are absolutely hilarious in exactly the same way that the unfaithful husband and his embarrassing astrology-obsessed girlfriend were funny in Husbands and Wives. I think overall this is what impressed me most about the film: it marks the return of Woody Allen as the razor sharp observer of human frailty, something we have seen too little of in recent years. Watching the film also made me realise why Allen struggles to find a mass audience these days. Far more than other directors, he uses body language - or to be more precise the discrepancy between what a character is thinking (privately) and what he or she says - rather than the screenplay to create dramatic tension and drive the narrative forward. We have grown so used to directors who spoon feed us with special effects or obvious plot devices that we are fast losing the ability to appreciate those who use more subtle techniques.    The central theme of the film is the nature of erotic desire, its connection to art and, more specifically, the conflict between erotic desire as the longing for something wild and seemingly unattainable and erotic desire as the bond which nurtures loyalty and long term relationships. This is essentially the same theme that Allen explored so adroitly in Hannah and Her Sisters and Husbands and Wives.  Vicky does genuinely love her fiance, but he can't satisfy her longing for aesthetic fulfilment; inthe end, she has to make a choice and she chooses to remain unfulfilled. Cristina is more bohemian and experimental, but eventually realises she is in way over her head in a complex menage-a-trois that isn't working. Some critics complained that, at the end of the film, Vicky seems to have learned nothing from her experience, and that this is a weakness. I think this misses the point. Vicky has learnt that she is much more like Cristina than she initially imagined. Cristina has benefited from her experience but is (one suspects) sufficiently American in her values not to want to repeat it. Both girls are left with a longing for something that remains out of reach. The film appears to lack a clear resolution because that it what real life is like. If Woody Allen had been making a conventional romantic comedy, it would presumably have ended with a wedding scene in which the bride abandons her 'worthy but dull' husband-to-be for the man she really loves. We can all feel grateful that he chose instead to make a film about the restlessness of the human condition.     The key message for Woody Allen fans who haven't yet seen VCB is that the critics who praised this film on its release were right: it does represent a genuine return to form. It is not as strong or assured as his best films from the '70s and '80s, but it is recognisably by the same director and exhibits most of the qualities that made those films so special. For most of us, that will be more than enough.
0061231401|3.0|Rollins' latest Sigma Force book finds Grayson Pierce dealing with both Rachel Verona, an ex-lover as well as the enigmatic Seichan, who attempted to kill him in another book.  He can't be sure if Seichan's trustworthy or not, but his team has to investigate why a South African archaeological dig was razed to the ground and a senator's son murdered.  The villains are a multinational corporation with designs on controlling the world's food supply as well as Seichan, who hurts Rachel in such a way that you want Grayson to smack her around a bit.  The action travels from Stonehenge to Norway and there's plenty of gunfights, snowmobile chases, espionage, and even polar bear attacks to make action thriller aficionados happy.  The book is a good escapist read, and I want to see where Rollins takes his characters next.

0316166685|4.0|\\"The Lovely Bones\\" deals with the difficult subject of child rape and murder, but Sebold crafts wonderful characters and her description of typical 1970s suburbia is spot-on.  The story's narrator is fourteen-year-old Susie Salmon, who is raped and murdered by neighbor George Harvey (whom Sebold gives a background as well, but it feels overdone and largely meaningless).  Her death sends her family into a tailspin; her mother eventually leaves and her father suffers health problems.  Her sister, Lindsey, takes it upon herself to help the police investigate her sister's death long after it's become a cold case.  Susie's school friends are also altered by her death: Ray Singh, her first crush, becomes involved with artist Ruth, who also senses that the dead aren't so far away after they leave the earth.  Sebold's description of personal heavens where Susie lives are beautiful and sad.  This is a book that lives up to its hype.
B002JM1VJG|5.0|This is truly Madonna's gift to all her fans for their loyalty over the years!  How wonderful to have all her favourite videos on this 2-disc compilation!  I watch it all the time!    When \\"The Immaculate Collection\\" was released I was disapointed that 'Who's That Girl' & 'True Blue' were not on the Video (nor the Album) and then when the \\"93:99\\" video collection was released I was disapointed that 'Erotica' & 'Deeper & Deeper' were not included.  Well disappointment no more because all the above listed videos plus all the other great ones like 'Burning Up'(her first studio video), 'Hollywood', 'Don't Tell Me', 'Love Profusion', 'Sorry', 'Give it to me', the recent 'Celebration' (made especially for this compliation) and so many more are all here.  The only ones left off can either be found on the 1st two compliations listed above or are not fan favourites anyways.  It is the fans who voted on which videos made the set and I thank them because they did an excellent job!    As for the pessimists who are complaining about the quality I honestly do not know what they are talking about because the quality is excellent.  These people must be spoiled by high-tech to the point where they are not appreciative anymore!  For any true Madonna fan, please disregard all those negative comments and appreciate this for what is is - the greatest Madonna video compiliation ever with excellent quality!

0385341008|5.0|Charming, disarming and wonderful insight into a group of resilient island residents in World War II.  But that is just the background.  The story is about Elizabeth whom you meet only indirectly through an exchange of letters. The whole book is an exchange of letters.  This might seem an odd way to write a book but for this author it works and you have a better sense of who all the players are by what and how they write.  I could not put this down - and finished it in one day (I was on vacation at the time!)I then went back and re-read several sections to appreciate them all over again.  I promptly purchased this as a gift to my three sons so they would learn about their mother's heritage.

0385504225|3.0|I loved the beginning of the book.  Brown isn't a great writer but he knows how to get his readers turning pages.  BUT -- the book should have ended earlier -- I think.  I've got about 28 pp to go and very little incentive to finish, now that the Solomons are saved, a \\"world crisis\\" has been averted, the denouement of Mah'lak has come and gone.  Masons?  Look, I get that great geniuses were once Masons -- but I cannot take seriously men in dress-up enacting little vignettes, no matter how symbolic. Yeah, Dan's got that whole \\"It was astonishing!\\" thing down pat -- God bless him, I think he's probably very happy with life if so much truly amazes and astonishes him.  I'm just not that type.  And really, if the Masons are such friggin' geniuses, you'd think by now they'd have included women.  Seriously -- how \\"enlightened\\" do you want me to see these men, in their bat caves, with their skulls and toy coffins, practically with a hand painted sign, NO GIRLS ALLOWED?  By the end of the book (minus 28 pp), I couldn't be convinced about the importance of the Masons, so the whole National Security Threat angle wasn't working for me. Like we'd be shocked to find out that our leaders are idiots and overgrown frat boys?  I think not.   And while I LIKED the twist about the son, it's rather hard to believe that Zachary wasn't recognized.  Even Barry Bonds is recognizable as Barry Bonds under all the steroids.  So there was the credulity factor, too.  I loved the research -- well done, Blythe! -- but after a point the repetition was numbing.  Noetics was fascinating -- it's too bad they exploded the lab, proofs, history, etc. and so early at that.  Knowing when to end the book would have helped.  Peter is saved -- wouldn't it be nice to have that stump attended to at the hospital?  Maybe get a shower, spend time with his sister, mourn his dead, then not-dead but worse-than-dead son?  Does it make sense to STILL try to convince us the Masons are onto to something by delaying all that and going for a blindfolded tour of DC with an old friend you were only in sporadic touch with...?  I know I'm reading fiction, but, jeez, I think I can see why his son was such a head case.  ;)  Overall, though, I enjoyed 3/4 of the book thoroughly.

B001QTXM5Y|5.0|\\"Who watches the watchmen\\" is one of the most memorable lines smeared across the buildings and lips of citizens in the graphic novel Watchmen. The graphic novel that went far beyond its time thanks to writer Alan Moore, it has since been turned into a popular movie phenomenon by director Zack Snyder, who managed to capture the pure essence of the novel straight to the core, leaving out what some believe are important components in the novel,  yet still maintaining the overall message. Watchmen presents the story of a group of masked heroes who live in an era where the world is on the brink of nuclear war.  The six masked heroes Dr. Manhattan, Nite Owl, Rorschach,The Comedian, Silk Spectre  and Ozymandias each represent the six ways to view the world in the radical time period it is set in. What ties this movie into a cultural phenomenon is the way in which it presents the solution and struggles of the Cold War era. The line \\"who watches the watchmen\\"  is a sort of an irony that can be seen at the end of the movie. The masked hero, also portrayed as the smartest man in the world, Ozmandias, plans to save the human race, and unite the nations against a common enemy, by faking an alien invasion that ultimately killed half of the population in NY, yet no one knows of this secret conspiracy. Although this ending was cut from the film, and substituted with a giant explosion,  it still presented the same message, that chaos that endangers the lives of friend and enemy alike, will result in union against this common enemy.    Although many skeptical fans believed that Snyder would not be able to capture the comic book in all of its glory, the outcome however begged to differ. Watchmen came out as an incredible watching experience, full of violence, drama, love and conspiracy. Each characters development is brought into focus on camera, what they discover about themselves and the world around them makes for an explosive emotional movie that captures young and old audiences alike.

0553582461|5.0|Apparently most fantasy readers (well, those that contribute reviews to amazon.com anyway) prefer their novels to end like a cookie-cutter Hollywood rom-com - and worse - the lowest grade - we're talking Sandra Bullock material.  I finished Fool's Fate Friday night in a 6 hour stint that cumulated with puffy eyes, various used tissues and a lingering sense of wonder.  Honestly, this was the second best ending to a story I've ever read.  Maybe if you're 14 (buying presale New Moon movie tickets) the fact that the Fool isn't a girl just, like, totally ruined the books for you!!!  However, I found it heart-wrenchingly beautiful...the Fool was Sacrifice for their world, any other resolution would've cheapened that and his love for Fitz.  Perfect!
B000001EL7|4.0|The final studio album featuring the original lineup of KISS on every song is also one of their best efforts.  \\"Love Gun\\" is drenched in the playfully raunchy, innuendo-laden style of rock that has always been a cornerstone of KISS' music.  You need look no further than the title track to know what this album is all about.<br /><br />Of all of the original lineup albums, this one features some of the best straightforward rock n' roll with a little boogie woogie thrown into the mix as well.  It has no ballads, unless you consider the cover of \\"Then He Kissed Me\\" made famous by the Crystals in 1963 as one.  KISS' version is entitled \\"Then She Kissed Me.\\"  While it's a bit different from the rest of the album, it's a wonderfully quirky cover that fits perfectly with the rest of this album's tracks.<br /><br />The obvious standout tracks are \\"Love Gun\\" and \\"Christine Sixteen.\\"  Both songs have been included on KISS' playlists since they were released on this album.  Other tracks of note include \\"Plaster Caster,\\" \\"Tomorrow And Tonight,\\" and the rocking \\"I Stole Your Love,\\" which is a personal favorite of mine.<br /><br />Also of note is the Peter Criss fronted \\"Hooligan\\" and the Ace Frehley classic, \\"Shock Me.\\"  Criss' tune is an exceptional entry in the KISS catalogue and I feel that his vocals are excellent.  Frehley's vocals are okay on \\"Shock Me,\\" but it's his guitar work that makes the song memorable.<br /><br />As always, Gene Simmons' bass and vocals are steady, and the Demon crawls out of the pit once again on \\"Almost Human.\\"  The Starchild performs wonderfully as well, and Paul Stanley even shows us his bass chops on \\"Love Gun.\\"<br /><br />\\"Love Gun\\" is no \\"Destroyer,\\"  nor is it a better album than \\"Rock And Roll Over.\\"  It doesn't flow as strongly as those two albums do.  However, the title track, \\"Christine Sixteen,\\" \\"Shock Me,\\" and \\"Hooligan\\" are four of the best tunes ever put out by the group.<br /><br />You can't go wrong purchasing this album, especially if you're a fan of hard rock.  For KISS fans, this album should be considered required listening.  Highly recommended, as are all of the other albums featuring the original lineup.ans, this album should be considered required listening.

B001TKADSY|4.0|This, second book by Hassini was very interesting. The first novel, the Kite Runner, dealt with mostly male relationships, this later novel centers around the lives of two, circumstancially reluctant wives to an abusive husband, the civil war in Afghanistan, the revolving status of women's roles in society --mostly their inequality in education, social and famial status, etc..) In the end, the author offers opportunities for both women, in completely different ways, to find redemption as it pertains to family and society. While the main characters are inspirational for the most part, their lives, which start out with with dedicated parents who love and protect them, offering them some measure of future promise, are now filled with horror and a little lack hope for the future.

B000148KK2|5.0|This Diana Krall set is now 5 years old as it enters my collection.  When music is good, it's almost timeless.  Tom Waits' song \\"Timeless\\" is playful with Christian McBride's delicious bass.  Her reading of Elvis Costello's \\"Almost Blue\\" is passionate and dives to the bottom of an emotional ocean with its throbbing bass line.  What first drew me to the album was to see how she would handle Chris Smither's \\"Love Me Like a Man.\\"  Unfortunately, she uses Bonnie Raitt's sanitized lyrics rather than Smither's raw original.  That said, the track smokes musically with some weeping guitar and Krall's rolling piano.  She takes Joni Mitchell's intriguing \\"Black Crow\\" and toys between urgency & blas&eacute;.  The closer \\"Departure Bay\\" is a pretty track, stark with Diana & a keyboard accented arrangement, \\"The house was bare of Christmas lights; It came down hard that year, outside in our overcoats.\\"  This is a stark and lovely emotional CD.  Enjoy!

0060920084|5.0|Riding in the passenger seat with Bill Bryson through 38 states and 14,000 miles makes for a highly comical and riveting drive. A hoot!<br /><br />Some reviewers tag the book as condescending, sarcastic and sneering.  Bryson calls it as he see's it...just how things really seem.<br />Along with pointing out positive attributes of our country, how can one also not notice the moronicities and ludicrousness which fevers the nation, whether it be in the people we encounter, the places, etc? Bryson is a genius in this category.<br /><br />In addition to his side-splitting activities from town to town and state to state, he rediscovers not only America but also his youth with many, many hilarious situations. Embellishments travel directly to the tickle-bone.
B002JM1VJG|3.0|The concept was good: release 47 of Madonna's videos many for the first time in one package. The delivery was the problem. At over three hours spread over two single layer discs we get Madonna overload. This is not necessarily a bad thing because she has provided much of the pop culture soundtrack  over the last three decades. The problem here is the video and sound quality.    The single layer discs do nothing for the picture quality of the videos. Many of them probably looked better in their original VHS format and the supposed Dolby 5.1 sountrack is also lacking in depth and power. Perhaps the greatest flaw with this set is that there is overt censoring on two of the most controversial videos (Justify My Love and Erotica. I remember when the songs came out and were available on VHS without the censoring and now almost 20 years later we are treated to black bars.    On the upside we do get some of the best and earliest works by some pioneer video directors. The videos showed a style that would be copied over the years over and over. Madonna was and is the standard setter for an entire generation of followers and her video collection deserved a much better treatment than it got in this Warner Brothers release.

B0000256VK|5.0|By the time of the band's final studio album in 1982, critics and some fans were howling that Roxy Music had become an extension of Bryan Ferry's solo career. But looks are very deceiving if one only glares at Ferry penning seven of the 10 tracks, while co-writing two with Andy Mackay and one with Phil Manzanera.<br /><br />The smooth R&B is enhanced by the production of Rhett Davies and remains a cornerstone release in the wild ride of the music industry in the 1980s. The spectacular The Space Between - The way I see it/This relationship ain't right/The space between us - is a musical masterpiece, with bassist Neil Jason propelling the beat, while guitarists Neil Hubbard and Manzanera subtly dominate the mix. The powerful Take a Chance with Me - As they say, two can play/But keep that song away from me - is a timeless exploration into the game within the game in real relationships.<br /><br />The majestic title cut, which features the dreamy background vocals of Fonzi Thornton and Yanick Etienne, merges into the first of two instrumentals - India - which slides into the slick While My Heart Is Still Beating, as Ferry the keyboardist plays off the bass lines from Jason. The sax by Mackay propels More Than This, while drummer Andy Newmark and percussionist Jimmy Maelen shine on The Main Thing. The interplay between Ferry and Manzanera on To Turn You On breathes freshness in the vocalist/guitarist standard in rock, with the clubland rhythms reaching incredible heights in True to Life. Mackay places a special coda on the album with his sax solo on Tara.<br /><br />The 37:31 found the band going out on top of the game - the album earned platinum status, though it peaked at only #53 on the Billboard 200 album chart - and transcends the swiftness in pop culture time and genres, like the wonderment that delights each generation surrounding the memorable stories of King Arthur's last journey to the mythical land of Avalon.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|It seems that Michael Jackson has been with me for my entire life.   I fondly remember him as a child sensation as part of the Jackson Five then quickly turning into a pre-teen idol who shortly after eclipsed his brothers with a string of solo hits like \\"Rockin Robin\\" and \\"Got To Be There\\".  We were still aware of Michael in his later teen years as he escorted Tatum O'Neil to award shows but at this point in his life, more famous for his celebrity, not his work.  Enter, the album \\"Off The Wall, featuring a newly coiffed and buffed Michael which generated some memorable hits.  He was just coming into his own as a young adult, so perfect for the newly evolving music video format.  Luckily, he defeated the odds of becoming a has-been which was territory he could have easily descended into.       Shortly thereafter, came Thriller, the record breaking album, the phenomenal videos and the famous \\"moonwalk\\" dance that was premiered on the Motown TV special.  How did he do that?  How does a human being move like that?  How does any artist get to have every song from an album a hit?  How can one person be THAT talented?  Sadly, after the Thriller years, Michael became the face of \\"weird\\", easy tabloid fodder for many, many years to come until the time of his death (and surely for many years to follow - expect convenience store sightings soon).  Wanting to purchase the remains of the Elephant Man, marriage to Elvis' daughter, the plastic surgeries, the child molestation accusations, the mystery surrounding the birth of his children, the dangling of infant Blanket over the rail of a balcony, the infamous Martin Bashir interview, all but a few of the headlines we the public sampled over the years.  There was all this drama but no more real music.  It was hard to remember Michael the performer and not Michael, the owner of Bubbles the Chimp.    I thought his career was so over.  Too much bad publicity. Too many excesses. It was just too late.  What evidence was there that he wasstill relevent? To quote sister Janet's 90's hit, \\"What Have You Done for Me Lately?\\".    I honestly didn't want to see this film.  I went as a favor to my sister.  Being tired, I thought a little shut eye would get me through this film if it became unbearable.  The first 10 minutes, I got what I expected, some dull dancer interviews \\"Oh my god, it's a life long dream to work with Michael\\", \\"He inspired me\\" etc...dull, snooze, snooze.  Well I love being proved wrong; captivated I was. The man could still sing, he could still dance and still \\"wow\\" me.  Contrary to the snooze fest I was expecting, this was riveting.  I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen.  In addtion to the performing, there was a very human Michael who starred as being Michael the person, not the drug crazed, nose falling off freak that we read about. He seemed healthy, he had a good sense of humor was charming and very much in sync with the business of his production.  He won me back as a fan and I've no doubt that if not for his untimely death, this concert would have put him back on the map.  He still had it and then some.    It got a little tiresome at the end but despite that, I would have given it a 10 star rating if I could.  Michael, you will be missed.  You still had it.
0887307280|3.0|I read this book once, and havent picked it up again. I bought it over a year ago when I began my quest to start my own business. It helped prepare me with the mindset that is needed to become an entrepreneur and to regain my freedom. but besides that it didnt help me much. however, it did help me to setup the structure of my first business model which will be helpful once I find the right books to help me start my own business. if you, like me, are seeking to become an entrepreneur then this book is cheap enough that you can read and wont regret buying, but dont expect it to have ALL the answers you need to start your own business..dont expect it to have ANY of the answers you need. Its probably PRICELESS to the over-worked entrepreneur but not so priceless for start-ups.... Im not sure what I was looking for, but Im quite sure that I didnt find it in this book. oh well....nothing gained, nothing loss. I wouldnt buy it again if i had to.... its only worth 'checking out' at your local library, im sure they have it. good luck :)
1594488878|4.0|Juliet, Naked is an entertaining and oftentimes amusing story about three people whose lives are intertwined through music and the internet.  Tucker Crowe, a reclusive musician who hasn't recorded since the 1980s, Duncan, perhaps his biggest fan and Annie, Duncan's longtime live-in girlfriend.  The novel opens as Duncan and Annie are visiting America from England, but focussing strictly on the important points of Tucker's musical careerm including the club bathroom where he reputedly had an epiphany and simply stopped performing and recording music.  The novel is its strongest and most entertaining in these opening sequences.  Duncan is completely over the top, but Annie puts up with him and Hornby communicates that relationship with much humor.  As the novel continues, an album called \\"Juliet, Naked\\" which consists of Tucker's unaccompanied music from his earlier \\"Juliet\\" album is released.  Through the magic of the internet, Annie and Tucker \\"meet\\" and strike up an email friendship.  Obsessions continue, relationships crumble and it is basically all very well done.  Hornby is a very talented writer.  High Fidelity is one of the best novels about music ever written.  Juliet, Naked, while enjoyable, is certainly no High Fidelity.  It is still an entertaining, light read with an original story line.  Enjoy!

B0000E6XKN|1.0|Although I generally like the music from this album - the DVD Audio is good example of how the record labels managed to kill this format. I bought this specifically for the higher quality STEREO ... but this disc is defaulted to 5.1 and it's extremely cumbersome and frustrating if all you want to do is listen to the album in higher res on your main stereo setup.   5.1 usually means home cinema (lower quality sound as it's also designed for movies) and in most cases awful 5.1 mixes of the original.  If you like this album buy the CD and save yourself the grief.
031604461X|1.0|As I've said in my other reviews, I really loved the idea of these books and the story they could have been. It's why I continued to read all 4 even though I had some serious issues with them. I feel like Breaking Dawn was written slightly better (from a writing standpoint only, not from a story-telling standpoint), a little cleaner and \\"chagrin\\" was only mentioned a couple of times in this book.    I felt like we actually got to know Bella a little bit better, though her character seemed to change when compared to earlier books, she still had a little more depth than the previous Bella. I felt like Meyers spent more time on the emotions that should have been covered in the previous books better rather than kept until the very end.     That being said....I thought this was way too fairy-tale happy ending. Bella fretted all the first three books over what she was going to lose, and Edward fretted over her giving up those things. Jake told her good bye how many times because he couldn't get past the vampire thing? Bella got everything she ever wanted! She becomes beautiful like Edward, Jake sticks by her while she's dying, and in a matter of like 5 weeks or so she gets to see Charlie as a newborn! What the hell, Meyers? Don't spend the first 3 books telling us how horrible it is for newborns and then pass Bella right through it! She had two super powers apparently, which is just complete and utter crap! She is a shield and she has uber self-control?! Oh, the pain, the pain, I opened my eyes and heard my daughters heart and all was ok! What is that?!    We continue to hear about how beautiful the Cullens are and when Bella actually wakes up from her transformation, she comments about how she's finally as beautiful as Edward and worthy of him! Then she acts like she can't even see her human self in the vampire because she's SO gorgeous now. I'm not really understanding how vampirism would change your features entirely. Give you nice clear, perfect skin, ok. Nice silky,beautiful hair. Ok. Rock hard abs, perfectly toned arms and legs. Ok. But changes the features of your face so drastically you can't see yourself? Come on...    Then Bella had to be taught how to use human mannerisms. Wait, wasn't she human for 18 years and vampire for only a few days? She remembers how her heart would flutter, how her blush would feel and her stomach would turn over, but she couldn't remember how to blink, or cross her legs or flick her hair? Ok, I would totally understand that if we're talking about a vampire that's lived in an utterly vampire world for a century and is meeting humans for the first time in a hundred years...And then all the vampire things came naturally, she naturally knew how to jump, exactly how far she'd go, how to be gentle and didn't have to adjust to her new strength at all. How fun that would have been to read about, but no...Bella is just a natural vampire...    Bella gets her perfect Edward, and just in case later she decides she wants a baby, she gets a baby who probably should have killed her on the way out, but doesn't. Then (gag me, ew, ew, and double ew because I am definitely a Jacob person way more than Edward) Jacob imprints on the baby so she gets to keep Jacob, she has super self-control so she still gets to see all the humans she still loves, and Rosalie now is her very best friend because of the baby. Bella doesn't give up anything to become a vampire. It's so irritating it makes me want to scream. Why go on for the first three books about how hard it's going to be, how much she has to give up, when she never gives up anything? When she doesn't suffer at all! Oh her throat burns!!! Shouldn't Alice have seen how easy it would be for Bella? Then Edward wouldn't have had to be so ridiculous the first three books and this all could have boiled down to one book.    Then the Volturi show up again. And I was actually on edge when they finally showed up. Why? I don't know...they just stand there and talk...again. Halfway through that point I hardly cared to continue because the edge had gone it took so long. Then nothing happened because Alice danced back onto the field with the answer and the Volturi just walk away. Again so anticlimactic it's frustrating. I don't understand why Meyers spends the time working this up when nothing's going to happen. The only person that dies is Irina, and honestly, she kind of deserves it because she tattle tailed mostly out of revenge not for the sake of the law, and you can't convince me otherwise because she hated Bella because of Laurent.     Then the name of the baby...seriously? Renesmee... It's not even pretty. It's just incredibly lame... Esme Renee would have been just fine with me (lame, but reasonable)...and how would a werewolf imprint on a half vampire? Doesn't that just go against the laws of nature? Why couldn't Jacob have been happy with some other girl he found at the park? Oh, that's right...because then he'd probably leave Bella and she'd have to give up her Best Man! It's just so utterly ridiculous how juvenile this book ended up being because it had to be so nice and neat and happy. Sometimes bad things happen, Stephanie, please don't make everything so puppies and kittens in your next book...that's not how the world works. Do I want to read about the exact world that I live in? No. And I'm willing to accept vampires, werewolves, wizards, goblins, etc. But all of those different beings will have the same problems we do...please don't act like everything is perfect because Bella is beautiful and wonderful and Edwards vampire wife now.
B00003CXIP|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was 7 years old. I'm 29 now, and it is still my all-time favorite movie. A wonderful movie about boyhood friendship and the different problems that each kid faces in his home life or in social situations. Four boys set off on a journey to find the body of a dead kid, but it's much more than that. The movie is about the camaraderie of the boys and the problems that each one faces. Chris, the leader of the gang, comes from a family with a bad reputation and therefor is labeled bad by the other people in the town. Gordie is a kid who is coping with the death of his own brother, but more than that, the lack of a relationship between him and his father. Teddy has a dad who is very abusive because he suffers mental problems from his experiences in WWII. Vern is kind of the social outcast. Certainly not one of the most popular kids in school.    Now, about some of the other reviews I have read and you may have read yourself: First of all, let me start by saying that if you're a self-esteem movement parent and can't stand curse words because they greatly offend you, stay away from this movie. This movie is very realistic. Believe it or not, 12 year-old kids swear, get over it. My friends and I swore long before that, but we never did it in front of adults. We didn't do it because we saw it in movies. We did it to act rebellious and thought it made us look older than we were, just like every other 12 year-old kid. These kids in the movie are just like any other 12 year-old boys. So do not use this movie as a scapegoat. Like I said, just get over the fact that 12 year-old boys do swear.    Second of all, this is NOT a chick flick like a couple of reviewers have said. Yes, this is not an action-packed Die Hard type movie, but that doesn't make it a chick flick. I'm a guy. All my friends like this movie, guys and girls, and none of the guys ever called it a chick flick. It's no more of a chick flick than the movie Rudy, which I have never heard ofreceiving that accusation. If you're that insecure in your masculinity, then please just stay away from the movie.    As long as the last two things I mentioned don't apply to you, order the movie right now!
B002VECM40|5.0|Based upon the 1996 novel \\"Push\\" by Saffire, the movie \\"Precious\\" tells a visceral story of finding purpose and meaning in the harshest of circumstances.  Directed by Lee Daniels, \\"Precious\\" is a low-budget movie which won recognition at several independent film festivals. The film secured strong commercial backing and is on the verge of a greatly deserved success.<br /><br />The story is set in 1987 in Harlem and it features a morbidly overweight, illiterate 16-year old girl, Clareece \\"Precious' Jones.  Precious has been raped by her father and as the movie opens is pregnant for the second time with her father's child.  Precious lives in a small, decrepit apartment with her abusive mother, Mary, who is on welfare. Mary abuses her daughter verbally and physically and treats her as a person of no worth or account in life.  Precious becomes wrapped up in herself and retreats to a rich fantasy world.  During scenes of abuse, Precious visualizes herself as an actress, thin and on the arm of a young light-skinned black man.<br /><br />Precious comes to a sense of herself during the course of this frequently disturbing movie.  Under the tutelage of a young teacher in an alternative school, Precious gradually learns to read and write and begins to keep a journal. She slowly learns to write and to be able to verbalize and confront her situation.  Precious also works with a young no-frills social worker who also helps her towards self-understanding and self-respect.<br /><br />In her film debut, Gaboure Sidibe portrays Precious with the maturity and passion of a gifted, seasoned actress. Monique plays the tormented Mary, Precious's mother.  In roles that could have become stereotypical, Paula Patton plays Precious' teacher,  Ms. Blue, Mariah Carey plays the social worker, Ms. Weiss, and Lenny Kravitz offers support to Precious in his role as a male nurse.  The brutally cruel back streets of Harlem, and the fetid apartment of Precious and her mother set the scene for the movie.<br /><br />This is a tough, vulgar, and raw movie which works towards moments of insight. Through language that is crude througout and through scenes of violence and despair, \\"Precious\\" offers a vision of the power of endurance, kindness, love, and creativity to redeem even the seemingly most hopeless and desperate situations.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanvulgar, and raw movie which works towards moments of insight.

1576754227|4.0|Let me compare \\"Eat That Frog\\" with a famous (and my favourite) personal productivity book \\"Getting Things Done\\" by David Allen. \\"Eat That Frog\\" is easier to read and to understand, and is shorter. \\"Getting Things Done\\", to the contrary, has more complex words, more syllables per word, and more words per sentence, when it comes to pure statistics. Since \\"Eat That Frog\\" has more density, it may also inspire somewhat stronger and faster. Even for the readers that didn't particularly find any new ideas in \\"Eat That Frog\\", they will certainly find out that the ideas are presented in a memorable way.    I think that the two books are designed to slightly different audiences. Although \\"Eat That Frog\\" has some over simplistic or worthless advices, the majority of recommendations are extremely useful. The suggestions are laid down in simple words, and are very easy to apply. You won't get stuck when it comes to implementing them.    The strongest point of this book is an advice to tackle the most difficult or unpleasant task of the day first. This technique is not covered in \\"Getting Things Done\\", and is almost forgotten in the other books on personal productivity, except in a book \\"Never Check E-Mail In the Morning\\" by Julie Morgenstern, which I also recommend in addition to this book.

B001P9KR8U|4.0|I enjoyed this film but I did not feel it was as great as all the hype it has received.  The director uses flashbacks in a confusing manner starting with an adult Jamal being tortured in a Mumbai police station.  We are then treated to all kinds of flashbacks with an adult Jamal playing the India version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire and a very poor kid Jamal being abused by his bully brother Salim.  Salim locks Jamal in an outhouse when the local celebrity comes to visit their villiage.  The only way Jamal can get out is to fall in the cesspool beneath the outhouse.  A Jamal covered with feces is able to get an autograph from the star.    Jamal's misery is intensified as his brother sells his Jamal's autographed photo and then a bunch of rioters kill the boys' mother.   The two boys escape the rioters to be taken in by some criminals that are trafficing and exploiting young children.  The boys eventually escape but Salim twarts the escape of Jamal's female friend Latika.    The movie follows them as they grow up and Jamal is constantly searching for his friend Latika.  The movie shifts constantly between the present day torture in the police station, Jamal answering questions on the TV game show and the boys story growing up.    All through their life Salim is bad to Jamal and Jamal can never seem to find happiness without Latika.  I really liked most of the film but I found the constant flashbacks and time shifts to be annoying.  Also, the subtitles when needed were virtually impossible to read.  Jamal's game show experience did not seem believable except if the movie were to be labelled a fantasy.    I did like the Bollywood number that the director threw in to the end.  I liked the Paper Planes song that is played in part of the movie.    One of the better movies of 2008 but not the epic film that many make this movie out to be.
B002MAQSAC|5.0|We all like the books, very exciting at the begining. My daughter loves it, she read it over and over again.
0385341008|4.0|Very interesting.  I liked the style, (letters to each other) the wit and the humor.  You get involved with the characters and learn a lot about the German occupation of the island of Guernsey during WWII.  You learn about the hardships they endured and also the positive spirit of the Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.  I highly recommend it.

B001FB55H6|2.0|when i first saw this movie i enjoyed it, there were a few things i didn't like. but overall it was fun. the change up of the ending was even understandable as a sign of changing times.<br /><br />but upon watching it again i realized that while this movie here is not terrible, they changed enough key scenes of this where the spirit of \\"watchmen\\" is just not here. by showing the fight where the comedian gets killed they more or less give away the bad guy in the opening scene and thats one of the biggest mysteries of the book. the actor playing ozzymandus wasn't so much poorly chosen as poorly directed. ozzymandus is suposed to be unasuming and tame making the final reveal beyond shocking. but the way this guy plays it he might as well be stroking a curly mustache everytime you see him. it just screams bad guy. it's wrong.<br /><br />rorchact overall is well done in this movie but they changed some things about his \\"birth\\" story that while they made it more visceral and apealing for a movie, changed the tone of the scene in a bad way.<br /><br />the fight scenes are a little bit crap, part of the genius of watchmen is that no one has super powers, but the fight scenes seem to suggest they have super strength or speed in some way. zack snyder is an excelent director but he's more geared towards action movie style. and watchmen is not an action plot, it's a story epic. infact alot if not all the fight scenes could've been taken out of this movie.<br /><br />the change to the ending is particularly crappy. i understand the motivation to it and it's not so much a bad ending in itself. but the original ending was designed to band humanity together for survival's sake, america and russia join forces against a bigger threat. but the ending in the movie is more like a religous message. \\"be nice to each other kids or dr. manhatten will come down and blow you up.\\" which is totally crap. or at the very least not on topic at all.<br /><br />this movie by itself is entertaining enough, but it's not good, just fun, and for what is one of the best stories ever written, this is a poor representation.and for what is one of the best stories ever written, this is a poor representation.
B002UD56I6|5.0|I live in Australia and knew that the only way I was ever going to see this concert was when or if it was ever released on DVD. Having lost the great man himself I felt a very strong urge to see the concert footage, not because of his passing but because we will never get to see his working on another concert again. To say that it was worth the ticket price is an understatement. I just loved the way he held all of the stage crew, musicians, dancers and even the concert producer, Ken Ortega under his spell. Every so often you can hear Ken Ortega saying Yes Sir and sounding as if he worshipped all of Michael's talent and the way that unless it was not done to MJs' liking then it was not done at all. I also loved the way that MJ stood up to him and made sure that Ken knew that MJ was not there just to put on a show but to have it done the way it was to be done for the fans.  I have seen this movie twice and for as long as it is on I plan on trying to see it at least a few more times. Thanks to Michael for putting this concert together and for the past 45 years of entertaining us and showing that perfection on stage can be done so long as you believe in what you are doing and knowing that your fand will love you even more for it. We will miss you so very much and Thank God that we will always have your music to bring you back to us if only for a short time each day.  So having said all this I just wanted to say that this is definitely one DVD that all MJ fans should buy so that they too can enjoy what would have been his best concert ever.
B00005JOA0|5.0|although I am not an expert I would recommend this movie to those of you who enjoy period movies. This movie kept my attention and kept me wondering what would come next.

B000YDE4HS|5.0|My Timerland Earthkeeper boots are well-made and comfortable.  I returned the   first pair I ordered in my usual size, 9.5W, because the boots were a little too  big.  I ordered a pair in 9W, which fit perfectly. The boots will not require a   break-in period because they are flexible right out of the box. The stitching is   even. I like wearing my new boots so much that I wear them at night when I am in   my pajamas. I've worn these boots on long hikes, traversing loose sand, rocky  outcrops, and steep hill sides. The soles grip loose surfaces well.  I've   haven't slipped on granite or basalt rocks.        I recommend these boots because of the high quality, sturdy construction, and comfort.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|I'm going to say this up front: I am not a Trekkie.  I've seen one Star Trek film, and to be honest I can't remember which one it was (one of the 90's ones); I do remember I wasn't overly impressed.  Not my cup of tea, you could say.  However, I've enjoyed J.J. Abrams's films (don't watch TV; sorry folks!), and loved Chris Pine in SMOKIN' ACES, so I figured STARK TREK was a sure-fire delight.  I was right.<br /><br />I won't rehash the plot, because while there IS one, it's so convoluted that I couldn't possibly hope to get it right; it involves time travel, and a sinister-looking Eric Bana (underused and underwritten, unfortunately) who has a grudge against pretty much everyone, but especially Spock, played with jaw-dropping aplomb by Zachary Quinto (and also a much-welcomed Leonard Nimoy; I told you this was a weird plot).  Along for the ride are names that Trekkies will recognize: Dr. Bones McCoy (Karl Urban at his finest); Uhura (Zoe Saldana); Scottie (Simon Pegg, also underused); Sulu (John Cho); and others.  Bruce Greenwood is a delight as always as the rugged Captain who belies in Kirk no matter what, and Anton Yelchin manages to steal most of his scenes as Checkov (much as he did in the recent TERMINATOR film).<br /><br />The other major star here are the special effects, and I must say, they are not lacking.  This is a heart-pounding ride, an action film in the old-school vein of quick wit and terrific explosions.  What keeps it from drowning in its twisted plot is the script, Abrams's spot-on direction, and Chris Pine as the lead role.  Pine shows he can be an action star with depth, a genuinely good actor in a role usually reserved for those with more muscles than talent.  Overall, STAR TREK is a pure and utter delight; it's not quite a classic, though I'm sure sci-fi fans my argue for it (and I won't stop them).  I'm not sure how it appeals to Trekkies, but for someone like myself, who's new to the series, this film is a kick-a** ride, and not one to be missed.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I am blown away by The Beatles Mono Set. It sounds So damn fabulous that I am immediately drawn back to 1964 where it all began and have to get out the Kleenex because it makes me tear-up to hear them sing all of these songs again remastered...wow! Beatle songs evoke such stirring emotions and are touchstones to the good times of an era that has no peer. Starting in 1964, thanks to The Beatles and all of the music and great musicians they helped launch became a hot bed of creativity like no other. I feel lucky to have been there!<br /><br />I own all the original albums and play them even with their scratches. I own the Blue Box set from the 1980's as well. I own the older CD's and \\"Let It Be Naked\\" but nothing compares to the Mono set.<br /><br />I honestly had no idea how moved I'd be by listening to this set. I was a bit cynical at first and did not order it on the first go round. Then I had a change of heart and thankfully, it was being sold on a 2nd round. I am glad I came to my senses because I see sets being re-sold for ridiculous prices since people thought they would only press and release 10,000 copies. There are too many Beatle fans to stop at 10,000 and too many people like me, who were slow to realize that this Mono Box Set is something like-no-other release of Beatle music. Now, I wish I could buy the stereo box set as well but I can't print money.<br /><br />If you are a Beatle fan and if you have been on the fence about buying the Mono Set--get off the fence and buy it. You will be amazed and awed at how truly beautiful The Beatles sound and you will never regret spending the money. Now, if I could just afford that $15k sound system to listen to it on.....<br /><br />I have to give a shout out to George Martin. Thank you Mr. Martin--we all know your contribution was valuable to  Beatle music and together with those other 4 geniuses, you  have insured that their music will thrill music lovers for hundreds of years and beyond.

B00005NB8J|5.0|I have always been a big fan of the film. They also did a lot of good things with the TV series as well, but they still couldn't measure up to the film. One of the reasons why the film is better than SG-1 is the actors. Kurt Russell and James Spader were always one of my favorite actors out there. Richard Dean Anderson and Michal Shanks are good too, but they couldn't measure up to Russell and Spader. Also there are a lot of continuity errors in SG-1 and Atlantis considering they were supposed to be continuations of the film.<br /><br />The Plot:<br />A dig at Giza uncovers a large metallic thousand-year-old ring... the Stargate! Professor Danial Jackson (James Spader) is called into to decode the symbols on it. He does so, and opens a doorway to a lost planet on the other side of the universe. Colonel Jack O'Niel (Kurt Russell) leads a team through the Stargate to the distant planet where they encounter a replica of the Great Pyramid, an enslaved humanoid race, and a powerful evil alien posing as the Egyptian Sun God, Ra. Now its a race against time not only to save the human civilization on the planet, but to save Earth as well!<br /><br />An epic action-packed film with a great story, great special effects, and great acting and directing. This is a great buy. And if you've only seen the TV series, then see where the story began with this film. Highly recommended!<br /><br />P.S.<br />Buy the Special Edition which includes both the original theatrical version as well as the extended cut.
B001AIRUP4|5.0|This movie is not just a cult film but has become a Halloween and Christmas animation classic.  The music soundtrack should be on Broadway; and  the stop motion animation is awesome.  Once again Tim Burton tackles one of his favorite subjects as only he can, the magic of Christmas...but this time, it's viewed from a darker fringe. Of course, It looks incredible in Blue Ray; thank you for your creativity and talent Tim Burton!
0316010669|4.0|This was an interesting point of view.  I think it was well researched, but does not share any of the counter-point to his position.
B001FB4W0C|3.0|Is this fourth season moving too far afield concentrating as it does on an approaching Armageddon and war between putative Angels and trafficking with Demons?  I personally preferred the first seasons where the emphasis was on Ghostbusting although the story threads are now deeper (and I would guess offend some people).    Production values remain unchanged and it's still a good 'watch' if you're into this type of programme but i'd like to see a return of the humorous aspects evident in the earlier series.    Either way - if you enjoyed the first three series, you'll still enjoy the fourth, but maybe not as much.

B001V7YWTQ|5.0|An excellent cd! It's the next best thing to actually being there. Both Winwood and Clapton are at the top of their game and their sounds still blend together beautifully. A must have for those of us who grew up listening to their music.
B002GYVRRI|3.0|This is a great addition for the true fan. For the casual fan, I would suggest the Court of the Crimson King. Remix is great quality and I particularly like the 5.1 mix.
B001ANOU7U|1.0|Happy to find this delightful  film in a format I can view using standard, Australian, equipment (Region 0).<br />This is most important as, whereas PAL and NTSC work equally well, I am constantly needing to double check the Region.<br />It arrived in a reasonable time.<br />Quirky plot, superb performances.A sweet film without being sacharine.
0802798225|5.0|Lets see, I can say this words that describe this book: Incredible! A-Must-Read! Hott!!! :)<br /><br />I enjoyed this book so much, thanks to a few other book bloggers and their reviews of this book, and to my friend for owning this book, I finally read it. And I am so glad I did. This book was W-O-W! I loved every moment of reading it. Every page I turned I was wanting more. Ever line I read felt like I was right there with the characters, experiencing everything they were going through - the good and the bad.<br /><br />As you read this book you are reading through the minds of two individuals, Alex Fuentes and Brittany Ellis. Alex is the kid from the wrong side of the tracks, the gang banger. He is a Mexican with a past that others see as bad, but he sees as just his past, something he can never forget. He is part of the Blood gang in a suburb outside of Chicago [the South Side], where him and his fellow gang members but also long time friends deal with drugs, alcohol, and frequent deaths of other members. Alex has had a tough life, but he never wants any one to feel sorry for him. Then there is Brittany, who is on the 'right' side of the tracks, the one with everything you could ever ask for plus more, plus shes the school head cheerleader. She's got the nice house, the fantastic car, the hot bod, the beautiful hair and of course the quarterback boyfriend. Except what you see on the outside, isnt always what you get on the inside. Brittany's home life isnt what you would expect. She rarely sees her father, and her mother has outbursts of total frustration, and her sister, well, her sister has problems of her own.<br /><br />Brittany and Alex get paired up in Chemistry. Much to Brittany's protests to her teacher, she cannot switch partners. These two are total opposites, or at least thats what they think at first. But then, as their relationship together grows into friendship, they see each other for who they truly are. They both learn to lean onto one another, and what they have together blossoms into something beautiful.<br /><br />This book is written very well, and at times it can be a little provocative [so it may not be suitable for anyone under 13], but it is an amazing story of two teenagers finding themselves, and learning to open up to someone else and become vulnerable.<br /><br />I recommend this book to basically everyone, and I plan on rereading it in the future. And I cannot wait to read more from Simone Elkeles :)er blossoms into something beautiful.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|My husband and I just finished watching this HBO series on John Adams.  It was a wonderfully done, authentic rendition of the book written by Pulitzer Prize winner David McCullough.  It took us several evenings to complete this DVD set and we found ourselves eager to see the next chapter in the series.  I recommend that all patriots of the USofA watch this DVD set so that you can be reminded of how our nation came to be.  This production was produced by Tom Hanks and seemed to be a labor of love.  Enjoy!

B002KREVCO|4.0|Backtracks is the long awaited release of the songs AC/DC had mostly had only released as B-sides to singles, but never found there way onto an actual album.    Mostly every AC/DC collector already has all of these songs. Either from bootlegs, internet downloads, or from the AC/DC website itself where a lot of these tracks where available to hear when you connected to the site using the Sony digi-packs they released a couple of years ago.    Stick Around & Love Song where recorded in 1974 for there first album HighVoltage which was released and still available only in Australia. Most of the original Highvoltage album and there next album in Australian, T.N.T where combined to make the world wide release of High Voltage. Only two of the tracks from the original High Voltage where on that album, and all but two of the rest where released later on 74' Jailbreak. These two tracks here should have been added to 74' Jailbreak, but what can you do about it now?    Fling Thing, Carry Me Home & Cold Hearted Man where recorded at the same time in 1976 or so, (along with Love At First Feel) and only got released as B-sides to a few singles. Though \\"Cold Hearted Man\\" was issued on some pressing of Powerage in Australia and Europe, however, those LP's are considered rare collectors items now.    R.I.P. (Rock In Peace) was released on the 1976 Australian Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap album. The album was not released to the rest of the world due to complications with Atlantic (I think it was) not allowing them to release it as they thought it was sending out the wrong message. After Bon Scott died in 1980, DDDDC was released in 1983 to the rest of the world and instead R.I.P, Love At First Feel took it's place.      Crabsody In Blue is from the Australian Let There Be Rock album released in 1977. It is considered to be the sequel to The Jack and is about as close as you can ever get to AC/DC almost doing a country number, but don't mistake it for one, it's pure blues driven rock.Snake Eye, Borrowed Time, Down On The Borderline are 3 songs recorded during the 1988 Blow Up My Video sessions. they each surfaced on B-sides to that albums singles and The Money Talks single from the next album. Each one of these songs could have easily been put onto that album with enough room for more, but like I said, what can you do?    Big Gun was recorded in 1993 for the movie Last Action Hero. It was also to see how producer Rick Ruban was at recording AC/DC, and he did a well enough job he got the gig for the next album Ballbreaker.    Cyberspace was recorded in 2000 for the Stiff Upper Lip album, but was only released on certain special 2 disc tour editions in various parts of the world.       CD 2    CD 2 features tracks that mostly all where also released as B-sides to various singles over the years. However they have been cleaned up and sound even better then before.    DVD  Speaks for itself doesn't it?      It's a good little package, and it's about time AC/DC released these tracks. However, where there is good, comes the disappointment. It's good to have all these songs remastered and sounding better then ever, but I can still not give it 5 stars. Because as a collector, I already have all this material. What we really wanted, was not just the stuff thats on here that we already had, but the songs we know exist, but are locked away in a vault somewhere. Plus the other songs that we do have that aren't included here.  \\"Shes My Babe\\" has surfaced in recent years as the warm up recording to Ballbreaker, but that isn't on here. Then there is the ones no one has heard, but know of, such as \\"Tight Rope\\", \\"Out Of Bounds\\", \\"The Cck Crows\\", \\"Rave On\\" and a few more.    Then there is the live material, such as Johnny B.Goode, Lucille with Phil Carson, Brians Shake, Messin With The Kid.    Brian has quoted before they can never satisfy what the fans want, well, haha, yas did it again ;) Lets hope for Backtracks 2!
B001PPLJIQ|2.0|I hope that all those who give this film a positive review would be equally enthusiastic about the story of an ex-SS soldier and his repeated statutory rape and subsequent desertion of a 15 year old girl.  Western society's pseudo-equality, presented in its most exaggerated form in Hollywood, states that the crimes of women, especially the good-looking ones, are to be forgiven and are nowhere near as bad as the identical crimes committed by men.  This is because women have feelings, even war criminals involved in genocide, while men are creatures devoid of them and deserve their full punishment.<br /><br />Throughout the film, Winslet's character shows not the slightest sign of remorse that she helped burn people alive, and merely tries to give excuses.  At one point, she asks the ridiculous question to the judge 'What would you have done?'.  This from a woman who volunteered for the SS to work in concentration camps, which only the mentally challenged could have had any doubts about even during the war.  Yes, say that to one of the German Wehrmacht's poor conscripts who were uprooted from family and home for military service, or faced a concentration camp for draft-dodging.  But please don't say that about someone who as a woman could have spent the war sitting pretty in her factory job, but chose to make extra money by working at Auschwitz.<br /><br />Apart from showing not the slightest sign of remorse for her part in the Holocaust, she has the audacity to commit child abuse on a 15 year old child, using him for her selfish ends and then dumping him when she'd had enough.  What he sees in the miserable, unloving, haggard woman is beyond comprehension.  But would fans of this film watch an equally well-made film of the repeated statutory rape of a girl with equal enthusiasm?  Or has Hollywood's gender fascism really blunted the intellects and moral sensibilities of so many?<br /><br />Should we really feel sorry for her excessive sentence for not admitting she couldn't write?  Certainly not.  We should see it as an example of the damaging effects of having an ego so massive, of being so swollen-headed and vain that one would rather get life imprisonment than admit one's failures. Pathetic. (But then again, this could never have happened in reality. Every SS applicant had a mountain of papers and forms to fill in and illiterates then wouldn't have got much further than your average applicant for the police force today.  More Hollywood fantasy.)<br /><br />The woman was lucky she wasn't prosecuted directly after the war when war criminals were still executed, which is what she definitely deserved.  Instead, she got away with life imprisonment, something the 600 poor women she enjoyed burning alive would have done anything for.  Kate Winslet and her young co-star do a good job playing these roles, no question.  But this film is fundamentally, morally flawed, and is not only hated by all Holocaust survivors for good reason.  It's increasingly hated by those who see the perversion of justice that results when we say that murder and child abuse committed by a woman are not as as bad as the identical crimes committed by a man.<br /><br />PS: I hope all those who liked this film are supporting ex-SS guard John Demanjuk. Looking at people's reactions to his story compared with Winslet's is the perfect way of assessing the level of gender fascism in our society. He is a Ukrainian facing life imprisonment for working just 6 months at Sobibor extermination camp. Not only did he work for a much shorter time than Winslet's character, but his country was under occupation and he would never have been in that job if the Germans hadn't invaded his country. Compare him with Winslet's character, who is a German who volunteers to be an SS guard for more money. Why doesn't John Demanjuk get as much support from those who feel sympathy for Winslet? (1) Most importantly, because he's a man. (2) He's old and unattractive. (3) The people assessing him aren't influenced by years of gender fascism and pseudoequality emanating from western feminist organizations that have led people to believe in the inherent evilness of men and goodness of women.r fascism and pseudoequality emanating from western feminist organizations that have led people to believe in the inherent evilness of men and goodness of women.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|Jeeves and Wooster: The Complete Series is a top pick for any who enjoy British mystery and humor, providing a fine collection telling of British aristocrat and bumbler Bernie and Jeeves, his hilarious resourceful valet who keeps him out of trouble. An outstanding presentation of British humor will keep viewers laughing.
0385341008|5.0|We read this in our book group, alongside 84 Charing Cross. This book is much lighter subject matter than we usually read, but paired with 84 Charing Cross, it still left a resounding message of how books can bring people together and make life better. I have read this book several times since then, and I fall in love with Guernsey and the characters more and more each time. It's perfect light reading for adults, and there isn't enough of that out there!
B002FOQY2M|4.0|I purchased this cd after listening to the short 30 sec samples available on Amazon. I'm pretty good at being able to tell whether I will like the entire cd, or not.   I was not disappointed. Fun, is a lot of fun, and puts me in a good mood. I like the use of multiple instruments thrown in with the usual guitar,bass,drums, format, common with many bands.   The songs are catchy, well thought out, and executed by musicians who actually play their instruments.   When I played the cd at my workplace, it was well recieved by most who were listening. However, the angry young cynics ran for the hills with their hands over their ears. Their loss.    Obvious influences would be the Beatles, Queen, Blur,(and as much as I hate to add yet another overused band included as influence)Jellyfish, and perhaps Stackridge?  This is a cd I will share with those I think will be able to appreciate it. Is it you?
B002E01LL6|3.0|I am very happy w/my purchase. I would have liked a better shipping time. Thank you,
B0025KVLT2|5.0|A timeless classic - beautiful songs and melodies -- a very crisp production - my 2nd favorite Beatles album and one of the top ten albums of all time!
B001PR0YDA|5.0|You all know the story, so I'll just skip to what's great about this version.  \\"The Polar Express\\" has become a Christmas classic to me so I really enjoyed Robert Zemeckis' \\"Christmas Carol.\\"  To me, it was simply magical.  I've always enjoyed the Victorian London films such as \\"Gaslight\\" or \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" with the fog, snow, & gaslit streets.  This is really as if you're experiencing the story yourself with Scrooge.  You're transported into the story & to me, that's what makes this film special.  It's the best 3-D movie ever!  This is a must-see in 3-D this holiday season.  Merry Christmas early!  Da' Wolf
B0025KVLTC|5.0|The remastering is fantastic -- very crisp - the vocals and harmony are superb.  The \\"trippiness\\" is a hint at things to come in Sgt. Pepper.  I know that some critics think that Revolver is the Beatles best album; I beg to differ.      The songs are great, but a little weaker than Rubber Soul.  The album does not have the overall \\"theme\\" that Sgt. Pepper does; not the instrumentation and concept.    Pepper's is pure genius.  This would be ranked 3rd by me in terms of best Beatles albums. However, it is still in the top ten of best albums of all time.
B0017HEX76|1.0|Perhaps I wasn't careful enough in reviewing my purchase but the DVD was the Korean version.  Don't remember seeing that explained on the internet before I purchased.
B002Q4TKAY|4.0|I am one of the guys that said when \\"Day and Age\\" was released that the album hadn't been that good in my humble opinion and that they had ended sounding like a pop band a la The Cure back in the 80's with their \\"Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me\\" record. So, I wasn't expecting much from this live record and to be honest The killers wasn't exactly the band I was hoping to see in live shows eventhough I knew I was going to buy the album. For my surprise I was wrong about the band playing live. They really made a great show, the guitarist really knows how to play his tunes as well as the bass player and the drummer (pardon my ignorance if I don't know the guys names). On the other hand, Brandon Flowers knows how to connect with the audience and he does sing pretty damn good (yeah, he might go off key every now and then and maybe he gasps for air too but who wouldn't?).<br /><br />Something tha was obvious for me is that The killers playing live try to reach the heights of bands like U2 or The Cure and that's not something bad at all. They want to be greater and bigger in every song and they want to let the audience know that. I didn't really like the whole \\"Day and Age\\" album released last year (maybe with the exception of the singles but not Spaceman... I still have a problem with that song... but I like much more the live version here) but for sure this live recording was pretty damn good to the point that the band has caught my attention again. Before I leave I must say that the \\"Shadowplay\\" cover from Joy Division is superb!!!! If a band... any band!... comes up with a cover of Joy Division... this band must be heard by everyone.
0307346617|1.0|As with many others here, I am a huge fan of Brooks' \\"Survival Guide\\", and looked forward to reading this book.  I assumed he'd take the same funny over-the-top-serious approach to World War Z, and gladly bought it.  I was very, very wrong.  This book is not funny.  It is serious.  It spends at least as much time talking (mostly incorrectly) about history and politics as it does about zombies.  He has the \\"bad guy\\" nations, like many middle-eastern countries, China, Russia, etc., get pretty thoroughly destroyed by the zombies, while \\"good-guy\\" nations like the US (despite the meddling of that Evil President Bush) survive.  If this were done in a lighter, sillier, or even more action filled fashion, this could work.  Unfortunately, the mash-up of cartoon good-guys win and bad-guys lose with Brooks' apparent need to lecture us on his world-view turns this book into a boring waste of time.  If you don't mind wading through a lot of modern history make believe to get a few admitted good zombie scenes, go ahead and pick this up.  If you consider yourself a student of history, don't read this or you will claw your eyes out before the zombies ever get a chance.     If you've never read the Zombie Survival Guide, don't let this book put you off it.  The Guide is well worth picking up.  World War Z, on the other hand, mixes preachy with absurd, a poor combination if I ever heard one.  If you want to go to the other end of the spectrum of zombie literature, I recommend \\"Zombie Haiku: Good Poetry For Your...Brains\\" by Ryan Mecum.  It's twistedly good fun.
0385504225|5.0|I think this is his best book yet, because it is not so much a rant against older systems of religious control, but more into the positive message of the mystery school type teachings.  Along with, of course, his fame for making it all into a thrilling mystery, which is what turns on alot of people, I guess.   But having been very familiar for a long time with the gnostic, mystery school type teachings and Masonic stuff in particular, I thought he did a very good job of \\"exposing\\" their egalitarian, universal \\"truths\\" quite well,  showing why the stuff was \\"secret\\" at one time - because institutions of control loved to \\"bash\\" this stuff with all the reasons he exemplified with examples in the beginning of the book.   Also very good at taking you thru existing monuments, buildings and murals in Washington D.C. that most people probably never knew existed!!  I'll bet the House of the Temple is gearing up for heavier tourist traffic!!  But heavy if you're not interested in ultimate truths!!!, again unless the mystery of what happens next stuff excites you; I did think the plot of the disenchanted son was psychologically very clever!!!!
B000YAG00A|5.0|i had seen this movie a million time when i was a kid. finally now i got dvd which its worth to buy, stanley kubrick did a fascinating film of this movie. all good characters in it especially vincent donofrio must be winning a award for it.
0307269981|1.0|I haven't even read this book and I won't because the predecessor - \\"The Girl...Tattoo\\" - was truly junk. The author is obviously totally devoid of stylistic talent and the plot/scenes creak and shudder like a sophmore cliche. Barring a true miracle, the author has not improved after his big 'success'. My warning: if you have any level of literary taste at all, don't make my mistake - save your money and time and skip this author!
B002MW50KO|4.0|A must for any Dylan die-hard. Sure, the vocals are gruff, but they make for a unique Christmas album.
B000006044|5.0|I'm usual into more rock music but got this album because it was on Rolling Stone's top albums of all time. It is really hypnotic and great to listen to all the way through.
1423119509|5.0|I loved the series when I got it from the library.  I was looking forward to the set and was going to pick it up from my local Borders, but they never got it in.  I ordered it off of Amazon and not only was it cheaper, but it came fast!  I'm now reading it to the kids at the after school program I work at and they love it!
038073186X|4.0|I enjoyed this book quite a bit! It was well-written, with great characters (judging from the preview, I think that the movie has been well-cast). The plot held unpredictable twists and turns, but the ending was not quite what I was hoping for... I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. Still, the book, overall, was a great read with a real atmosphere.
B002MEW7YY|3.0|An otherwise excellent MET production ruined by the director, Mary Zimmermann's gimmick of introducing a bossy photographer fussily setting up his wedding-shot during the sextet, \\"Chi mi frena in tal momento\\". Obviously, Ms Zimmermann feels that the sextet, one of opera's greatest ensembles, is far too much of a cliche to make an impact on a modern audience, and needs a distraction. She's wrong: a distraction is all it is, and a most annoying one at that - I hated it when I saw it Live in HD, and it's even more irritating on re-viewing. Can one five minutes' worth undermine an entire production? In this case, yes. But on the plus side, Netrebko (not really a \\"Lucia\\" voice) gains in strength as the evening progresses, to finish with a very dramatic mad-scene, and the tenor, Beczala, substituting for an indisposed Villazon, makes us feel we've got the better of the deal.
B001JAFYFG|5.0|I'm giving this 5 stars simply because of the movie. Logan's Run is one of the all-time Sci-Fi classics in my opinion. It tells the story of a civilization where there are no wants or needs, no disease, no jealousy, no anger, no sadness whatsoever. It is upotia. The catch is, and you knew there was one, that you have to die when you're 30. Just about all functions are controlled my a central machine (George Orwell would be proud) with discipline carried out by a police force called Sandmen, which are just the cream of the crop humans. Why does the perfect society need a police force? As you might have guess, some people don't want to die when they're 30, so the run and try to escape the city to a place called sanctuary. And that is the basic premise of the movie.    The story examines many concepts of how people react and behave in such a world. There of course is the Orwellian concept of central control. What is the price of pure, uninterrupted happiness? What will people risk to keep on living? Especially when they literally have nothing to lose. But the main thrust is what happens to a person when they find out that everything that they have ever been taught, everything they have ever believed turns out to be a lie. Can they accept it? Will they keep their beliefs when the truth is staring them straight in the face?    As for the blu-ray, it is a straight copy of the DVD, so there's no other goodies to go along with it. The problem is that there weren't that many goodies on the DVD. The only special feature is a commentary by Michael York (who place the title character), the director and producer. It was very interesting, don't get me wrong, but you could tell that the three had recoreded their commentary separately so there was no interaction between them, which is always nice.
0385341008|4.0|I found I enjoyed this little book more than I thought I might.  I wasn't sure I'd be able to get into the format of \\"letters.\\"  But before long, I was there, after WWII in GB and Guernsey!  I'd love to be able to travel to Guernsey even now and see the island \\"up close and personal!\\"  Lovely little book and quick read.  I would definitely recommend.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|No matter what type of a music lover you might be, this DVD/CD is a must have.  It is much more than the blues, it is a snapshot of life as it was and where some have been.  It is amazingly honest, transparent and emotional.  You could not have created this without real passion, love and committment of all those involved.  This item serves as a memorial tribute to those forefathers of the Blues and those that were the originators of the music as we know it today.  Entertaining, compassionate, engaging and the real deal.  For all ages, genders and anyone that knows life is much more than it appears on the surface.  You can't re-create this folks, as many of the featured people have now passed away.  What a beautiful creation.
B001OQCV24|5.0|Estimated Budget of $500 Million.. The cash shows on the screen-extremely impressive effects throughout. At 158 minues the film really has very few slow points-if any. Go see it NOW!
0618526412|5.0|The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter is a well written detail oriented look at the south as pertains to a deaf mute and his mentally disabled mute friend. It is a book that will choke you up, and keep you hooked. I like to read a book and finish it feeling changed in some way, and this book changes you. There are deep rants concenring communism, or the basic ideals of communism, which in theory are beautiful. Human nature robs communistic ideals of their beauty. The charachters in this book are very strong and interesting, and the way they are all drawn to the mute Mr. Singer, shows that we all want to be listened to. This is a great book that I feel every single person should read, and at the same time, I want to hide it and keep it all for myself.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I have been working out most of my life--2 triathlons, a half marathon, etc--and have had several personal trainers throughout the years.  ALL of the trainers tell you to keep your heart rate high while doing strength training and incorporate combination moves in order to burn the most calories.  I was skeptical that a 20 minute workout at home could do all the things I've usually trained to do in the gym.  This DVD really works!  I started with Level 1 thinking I would need to go straight to Level 2...boy, was I surprised!  Level 1 had me huffing and puffing and sweating!  AND I was sore the next day.  This is a great alternative for a quick morning workout when I know I won't be able to make it to the gym.  For a REAL challenge, I have done Level 1 and 2 back to back as well as Level 2 and 3...those are killer workouts.  If you have a set of heavy weights, have them handy for the chest fly's in Level 1.  Keep in mind, it's really more like 25 minutes (with the warm up and cool down), but still--25 minutes and your done.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Overall this a good hard workout.  The intro, which you can't skip, is annoying on a daily basis.  Who wants to see that every day?  That part wasn't well thought out by the editor.  It seems to be a common complaint.  I also wish it were customizable like the Cardio Max DVD.  Pay attention to form & your own body cues.  Basically, hard breathing means keep on trucking, pain means alter your form (& keep on trucking).  I consider myself to be in at least average condition(working out 3-5X/wk)and this DVD was harder than expected, which is pleasantly surprising.  I was sore.  I've never actually seen Biggest Loser but I now understand why they lose such weight.  I have continued to use the DVD but I'm mixing it up with other workouts now because my knees, although I've been careful, are now making noise when use the stairs =:-O.  I'm glad I bought this DVD & will continue to use it.
B002KSPKRS|3.0|This has a hiss when there's no audio.    This seems to crackle or pop loudly when there's an sound change or break. Examples: plugging the headset cable in and out, press forward skip 30 seconds in Windows Media Center on Xbox 360.    I hear high pitched noise when plugged into the headset and it's more noticeable by raising the headset volume. It may be the controller.    After standing up and have the Xbox headset cable pulled from the X41 headset one time, voice chat doesn't work unless the cable is plugged in tightly. The headset port on the X41 loosened and the cable would fall out a little. It stays plugged in if I don't shake my head violently.

B0029O08WA|5.0|The soundtrack to the Twilight Saga: New Moon is great. If you are a fan of the saga, then you will definitely find that the song choices for this soundtrack are very fitting for the movie. The music is much more sullen than the Twilight soundtrack, but that it to be understood. There are some popular groups with some great music and some new bands that some people have never heard from. From my personal favorite of 'Possiblity' by Lykke Li (one I have never heard from) to the more popular 'Meet me on the Equinox' by Death Cab for Cutie. These songs are wonderful and I believe it truly captures what a fan would be looking for in a soundtrack for the second movie of the Twilight Saga.

0812550706|5.0|Aside from being one of the most accurate descriptions of modern warfare in print, Ender's Game is a compellingly written story with a protagonist you will find hard to forget. Why Orson Scott Card felt the need to defend his classic sci-fi novel on amazon.com, I will never understand. Over 2000 reviewers have given it five stars.  (Not to mention the fact that it won the Hugo and Nebula Awards.) We like your book, Orson! And for very good reasons.<br /><br />The most frequent criticism leveled against this book is that the writing is too plain. In fact, the impact of this book is largely due to the simplicity with which the ideas, thoughts, and events are expressed. This is a book about war, which means that lyrical, poetic writing would have been completely inappropriate. The straightforward prose is perfectly suited to the topic. Moreover, there is absolutely nothing wrong with a no-frills writing style. Far too many authors get caught up in the sound of their own prose. It was a welcome relief to simply be able to read a story without having to stop and admire the cleverness if its author.<br /><br />The other frequently heard criticism is that the characters don't act, think or talk like children. This is indeed true. But, they aren't supposed to. Ender's Game is a vastly extended metaphor about war. The very untypical children who fight the war against the \\"buggers\\" represent the very real children who fought in Vietnam (and in all wars). Your typical soldier goes straight from Senior Prom to bombing raids, and an 18-year-old is not by any stretch of the imagination an adult. Card's point that wars are, in reality, fought by children, is very well taken, so rather than get stuck on a literal reading of this book, reviewers should consider the fact that Card makes his point thoroughly, convincingly and without compromise.<br /><br />Card's unwillingness to compromise in order to demonstrate the moral, ethical and social dilemmas that lie at the heart of warfare is what makes this book great. This is what speculative fiction is supposed to do, and I can only say that in Ender's Game, Orson Scott Card has succeeded where many more \\"realistic\\" authors have failed.great.

B000001ELR|5.0|My how the mighty have fallen. Just a few short years earlier, KISS was on top of the world. But after 3 back-to-back albums that strayed heavily from the tried and true KISS Rock and Roll formula, well, this just did not sit too well with a lot of their longtime fans.<br /><br />That, on top of the departure of drummer Peter Criss, and the lack of involvement from guitarist Ace Frehley, made things look even more bleak for Kiss's future.<br /><br />Enter, Creatures of the Night, a heavy rockin' album unlike anything that KISS had ever done before. A lot of fans have mixed feelings about this album, but I freely admit that I love it madly. Times change, people change, and KISS changed their style yet once again, but this time it was for the better.<br /><br />No more Disco songs, no more mushy Pop songs, just straight ahead hard rock/heavy metal. Even the ballad, I Still Love You, sung with amazing depth by Paul Stanley, had a harder edge to it than other KISS ballads in the past.<br /><br />This album was just the shot in the arm that KISS needed at that time, and it proved without a doubt that KISS was not over as a band, not by a longshot. With the help of drummer Eric Carr, lead guitarist Vinnie Vincent, and Bob Kulick, among others, KISS had triumphantly returned from the dead, loud and proud.<br /><br />Standout tracks are, well, practically all of them, really, from the exciting opener Creatures of the Night, sung by Paul Stanley, to the awesome closer sung by Gene Simmons, War Machine.
B001ILFUDM|4.0|I explored the BD-live feature for the first time last night, and most of the functions require  registration on Disney's site.

B00288KNL8|4.0|What self-respecting kid hasn't, at one time or another, wished for a different set of parents - you know the kind who wouldn't make you brush your teeth or eat your vegetables, and who would let you play in the mud and stay up late at night and have every single thing your greedy little heart could ask for?  Well, Coraline finds just such an alternate universe lurking in the corner of the rundown Victorian home that she and her consistently busy and utterly self-absorbed parents have just moved into - a magical world hidden behind a secret locked door where mice dance, cats talk and duplicate parents cater to a beloved child's every whim and fancy.  But as the old adage says, \\"Be careful what you wish for\\" - and soon Coraline is discovering, much to her dismay, that this \\"perfect\\" world and these \\"perfect\\" parents may not be quite so perfect after all.<br /><br />Based on the book by Neil Gaiman, \\"Coraline\\" is one of the most enchanting and visually arresting films to have come our way in quite some time.  Prime credit for its success goes to writer/director/production designer Henry Selick and his team of 3-D/stop-motion animation wizards who have created a world that is rooted in both reality and fantasy at one and the same time.  The triumph begins with the heroine herself, a feisty, naturally curious, no-nonsense kid whom any viewer, regardless of age, will be immediately drawn to.  As voiced by Dakota Fanning, Coraline is skeptical without being cynical, and her yearning for a mother and father who might actually pay a little attention to her could not be more universal in its appeal.  Like all good fantasies made for kids, \\"Coraline\\" finds its truths in its central character - in a lonely child who has been ripped away from her friends, and whose parents are so intensely focused on their own adult interests that they have no time to enter into the world of childish things that naturally concern her (people can`t even get her name right, since just about everyone insists on addressing her as Caroline).<br /><br />But all is not sweetness-and-light even in the bright and colorful \\"other\\" world that  Coraline visits - not by a long shot.  For the movie taps into many of those primal fears - of abandonment, of being seduced by evil with promises of goodies - that loom large in many of our most cherished folk stories and fairy tales.  Thus, since \\"Coraline\\" does venture into some pretty dark places, it might prove more than a little disturbing for very young audiences.  Older kids, on the other hand, will likely enjoy the creepiness and will surely find themselves rooting on this imaginative and resourceful little girl as she uses her courage and intellect to outwit those who would cause her harm.<br /><br />The animation is first-rate on every level.  The characters, with their sharp angles and spindly protuberances, look at times as if they'd just stepped out of a Tim Burton production - and the somber, nightmarish setting, with its dark skies and gnarly trees, conveys that impression as well (not really much of a surprise, actually, since Selick was the director of Burton`s \\"Nightmare Before Christmas\\").  Yet, \\"Coraline\\" never feels derivative of other movies; it is instead a wholly original and beautifully crafted work in its own right - and one you would be foolish and improvident in the extreme to miss out on.sists on addressing her as Caroline).

0385504225|2.0|This book really wasn't worth the wait or hype. It, quite simply, is a formulaic attempt at writing another \\"Da Vinci Code\\".

1416550542|5.0|This book has it all: intrigue, romance, and mystery. It's undoubtedly one of the best books I've read this year.
0691142165|3.0|I have little to add to previous reviews of book contents.  However, my take away was different than that of prior reviewers.  The book provided less than I expected.  I had hoped for an attempt to relate the various crises in a holistic manner by considering interplay between banking, currency, internal and external political pressures including war, markets and flaws and excesses therein, debt, inflation, greed of the ruling class, competition between societal classes, etc.  I expected to receive the benefit of the authors' experience, wisdom and insight.  I imagine such an effort would have required focus on one or perhaps a few comparators for the present situation.  That was not the purpose.  Instead the book is a vehicle for showcasing an extensive new economic data set developed by the authors of 800 years of economic crises.  One receives a birds-eye statistical analysis of that data.     That is not to say that the work was poorly written or uninformative.  A number of insights were provided and supported through cogent argument and readable graphics.  The text was quite readable though redundant in places.  Good effort was made to provide two reading tracks - one for those who wanted to know details behind the analysis and one for those focused on findings and conclusions.  Important, recurring themes were demonstrable through the data, and considerable useful and interesting information was certainly provided.      Nevertheless, only a few general and cursory allusions were provided to the \\"why and wherefore\\" factors noted above; i.e., context was studiously avoided.  Absent consideration of the larger picture including motivations of significant players, the authors' concluding recommendations for avoiding future crises were produced with blinders and appear real-world unrealistic at best.    This is a readable economics text which provides historical economic data that are likely to be relevant to the course of the present crisis.  Its weakness is thatbeyond statistical delineation of selected historical economic markers of risk (which were mostly intuitive in any case) it does not provide insight into the nature of past, present or future difficulty.  Perhaps my expectations were misguided but I was not prepared for the measured, academic tone of the book with steadfast refusal to venture beyond the central data set.  As such I was disappointed and found the effort sterile and overly long.

I read it quickly, hoping to fall in love with it,, but it was {gasp!} boring, the characters were so-so, and the ending was a huge let down.  As far as the writing style goes (for the teen crowd)- it was better written than LJ Smith's books (more detail, better fleshed out characters, etc.) I liked it about as much as City of Bones (which I also thought was boring and lame, with a bad ending)-- so if you liked  City of Bones, you might like this.

0393061310|2.0|The critiques of Guns, Germs, and Steel  show it is a very controversial book: many reviews, very long, very incisive.    The main idea of the book  ¯  that history on the largest scale is determined by geography and biology  ¯  I have never seen presented so thoroughly. Diamond analyzes suites of plant and animal species available for domestication, and shows how the combinations gave some cultures inestimable advantages over those less endowed, which allowed them to abandon the wandering life-style of the hunter-gatherer, and use the food surplus to support indirect contributors who could build social and political structures, warfare organizations, alphabets, and technologies.  A tremendous headstart over others.    He also shows how the orientation of the continents (Eurasia east-west, across a narrow batch of climates, the Americas and Africa north-south across a wide batch of climates) made it easy for agricultural discoveries to pass between Asia and Europe, but almost impossible for them to be disseminated on the other continents. And of course, it was agricultural advances that made all the others possible. Fascinating idea.    But so many faults.    Diamond combines Europe and Asia into \\"Eurasia\\", which may be acceptable as geography but not as history. The fact is that the Fertile Crescent (source of European culture) and China (Asian culture) are two very separate fonts of civilization, that led in very different directions, and combining them is unrealistic.    Several times he says the last Ice Age ended 13000 years ago. Now an Ice Age takes 100,000 years to build up, as icecaps advance south, and about 50,000 to melt back, and they are still melting.  I don't think any geologist can say to within a millennium or so when the last ended or next will start, but it is clearly simplistic to insist on 13,000 years ago as the cusp between two Ice Ages.  If it were, the Earth would have been detectably cooling over historical time, not warming.    The \\"Germs\\" part of GG&S is another oversimplification. If the settled peoples of the world gave the others animal-derived diseases like smallpox and influenza, the hunter-gatherers gave back anthrax, plague, and siphylis. The fact is that microbe transmission took a tremendous leap, in both directions, after the discovery of navigation, and all peoples were equally affected; but the civilized peoples were in a better position to study and confine disease.  Diamond's text leaves the impression that Europeans deliberately used disease as a weapon, which he doesn't document.    Then there is the circular reasoning about domestication of animal and plant species.  Certainly, the peoples of the crescent had a fortunate suite of plants and animals available to them, and this gave them a headstart (not a new idea), but other peoples had other groups available.  But (Diamond says) the other groups were \\"undomesticable\\". Why undomesticable?  Well, obviously, because they weren't domesticated!  Diamond blames the plants and animals as \\"undomesticable\\", instead of blaming the people who failed to domesticate them. A case in point (which Diamond claims to address but never does) is the bison: the European bison (\\"wizent\\") was domesticated to give our cattle, but North Americans never domesticated the American version.    But the worst of GG&S is the bias. Apparently all historians and anthropologists are racist  -  except, of course, Diamond.  In the nineteenth century, some European thinkers concluded that other races were intellectually inferior to Caucasians, but no one has thought that in the twentieth, which is when almost all of modern anthropology was worked out.  Diamond's racist historians never existed - they are straw men, invented only to be maligned. I was particularly affronted by his view that examiners of intelligence tests, following WW II, \\"tried to show\\" that US blacks were less intelligent than whites. With thousands of test results pouring in over decades, they naturally analyzed them for whatever stats they could get. The tiny, but statistically-significant, difference between blacks and whites was discovered, but quickly attributed to flaws in the test structure, differences in education opportunities, and problems with administering the tests. It is obvious that racial differences in intelligence (if any) are infinitesimal in comparison with the range of differences within any one race. And now, so many people of all backgrounds have been thrown together into the modern work pool that it is quite obvious that anyone can do anything.  There are winners and losers, still, of course, but not because of race.  Everyone has known this for half a century, but Diamond tries to make it racist, to make something offensive out of it.    If Diamond had ignored his predjudices and focussed on his technical material, GG&S would be a better book.
B002NWRMVS|4.0|This new Norah CD is being received as some kind of \\"beefed up\\" version of her music, or a \\"return to rock.\\"  I understand where that perspective is coming from.  The songs are more rock/ roots oriented, but for me, this is not any kind of major departure from her previous stuff.  First, she's still a singer-songwriter, and the observational and confessional style of song she writes (or co-writes) is still very similar to before.  Second, while the tunes often have a more upfront electric guitar (one difference), otherwise they are still largely on the mellow side.  A new song such as \\"I Wouldn't Need You,\\" still has Norah softly crooning the lyrics over a slow tempo, with a relatively gentle backing band.  Not that this is a bad thing!  I would use the word \\"charming\\" to describe the singer and her music, and that's undiminished on The Fall.  Compared to someone else in the roots-rock field like Lucinda Williams, Norah Jones is not someone who's going to bowl you over with her passion.  It's more of a seduction than an \\"in your face\\" approach.  All of that said, I've really enjoyed listening to these new songs, and I think I'll be enjoying them much more in the days to come.

B002TOJOVG|1.0|I'm sure we've all experienced many movies where we said to ourselves, \\"Well, I'll just turn my brain off, sit back and enjoy the thrills (or chills, or silliness).\\"  Heck, a great thing about a lot of movies is being ABLE to do that and just have a childlike good time.  There are many mentally undemanding movies that delight:  THE HANGOVER is the most recent example that springs immediately to my mind.  It stretches credibility, yet is generally so well cast and constructed, and so genial in its carrying on that only a real Scrooge wouldn't crack a smile.  I would also say that CRANK 2, a truly jaw-droppingly unrealistic movie actually works in its quite twisted way because it clearly knows that it has gone way to far in terms of physical believability or even good taste.  (SHOOT `EM UP is an even better example.)  These kinds of films are sometimes guilty pleasures...but they often are the movies that come down from the video shelf over and over again.  I've watched SUPERBAD a few more times than CITIZEN KANE.  Is it a better movie?  Hardly!  Is it more entertaining?  Yep!  And it has heart, too.    Then there is LAW ABIDING CITIZEN, a movie that wants to be serious, intelligent, \\"adult\\" action thriller with a moral message.  In reality, it is a piece of trash that needed to embrace its real self.  Thus, it mostly fails as either kind of movie.    The film opens with us meeting handsome but homespun Gerard Butler as he shares tender moments with his young daughter and lovely wife.  He is an inventor or engineer of some sort, but mostly seems to be a nice guy that you'd expect is nice to his neighbors, goes to church, wears sweaters and is devoted to his family.  A GOOD guy.  Yet in mere moments, he suffers a home invasion that leaves him without a family.  His family is killed  before his eyes in a manner that is so uncomfortable to watch that we frankly never quite shake the squalor.  I realize there's nothing \\"entertaining\\" about a family being killed, but direct F. Gary Gray goes a bit too far.  He doesn't just generate righteous outrage in  us, but an uncomfortable feeling of \\"this movie  has gone too far for a piece of fluff.\\"    The bad guys are caught, and prosecutor Jamie Foxx steps in.  A driven man with an eye on  his next promotion (has there ever been a movie ADA that isn't ambitious and driven to replace his boss?), Foxx eventually plea bargains with the bad guys, much to the unbelieving anger of Butler (understandably).    Years pass, and one of the bad guys gets out of jail.  He is almost immediately kidnapped, tortured and killed by Butler (again, in a manner that borders on films more like SAW and HOSTEL).  And Butler is almost immediately caught an imprisoned.  But now he's not such a teddy bear.  He's a ruthless killer of his own, who apparently has figured out a way to carry out a rather complex revenge scheme, even while in prison.  Foxx must figure out what's going on before Butler has killed his entire team, because he blames the system as much as he blames the killers.    The film contains lots of scenes of verbal cat-and-mouse between Butler and Foxx, and the two do bring a lot of charisma to their scenes together.  But the script isn't particularly intelligent (although the way the film is directed...and  filmed, with lots of gray tones), clearly the creators thought it was smart and taut.    But the killings become more and more elaborate and rococo.  Butler resembles little more than a more handsome and healthy SAW killer...able to spin elaborate murders that are also neat little moral lessons.    We're clearly meant to agonize over what Butler is doing.  The system certainly wronged him...coupling that wrong with what he endured, along with a brilliant engineer's mind, and you apparently have the recipe for a diabolical (but righteous) serial killer.  Foxx mostly glowers and looks angry, and other than a few bursts in his encounters with Butler, his performance is one-note and not very interesting.  NOTHING of  his natural charm comes through...he's created a workaholic tighta** who is also a humorless party-pooper.  So it's actually easier to root for Butler than for him (although Butler's performance is one-note as well...he at least has some manic, if unspecific, energy).    But while 85% of the movie is a fairly uninspired thriller with a few explosions and some gruesome killings...we ARE left to wonder:  how is Butler doing all this from jail?  Does he have help from the outside?  And then, wonder of wonders, the truth is revealed and the movie goes from being just barely okay to jaw-droppingly laughable.  It's a \\"surprise\\" twist that should win awards of audacity (and also for implausibility).  I had to laugh outloud, then I stopped to assure myself the movie was REALLY doing  what I thought it was, and when I ascertained that it indeed WAS...I laughed some more.      How anyone made the final few scenes with a straight face is beyond me.  Had the movie been made with a tone that was more \\"nudge-nudge\\" than deadly serious, it might have come across as just another crazy twist in a wacky revenge fantasia.  Instead, it was the final nail in the coffin of self-seriousness that this film should be buried in.    I can find very little to reason for you to endure this film.  I've done it for you, and you should thank me for the warning!!
B00004XPPC|2.0|Yes I know.  This is an old, classic, best picture flick.<br /><br />It's just too damn slow.  The William Holden character, the American P.O.W., really should have been an interesting character.  He was almost interesting after he escaped, playing around with a girl on the beach...some of the dialogue was trying for some witty, snappy, Casablanca-esque pop...but it just wasn't there.  It just seemed like everyone was writing talking in slow-motion...all the actors were slaves to long-winded dialogue in the script.  I just read that Guinness wanted to play his character with a sense of humour but the director insisted he play it as boring as possible.  Someone needed to bring that fiery, sarcastic character and I feel it should have been Holden.<br /><br />Everything said in the same boring matter-of-fact tone for almost 3 hours...there's no background music to keep things moving along...I ended up dozing off in the middle somewhere.<br /><br />I'd never recommend this to anyone.  And I'll never see it again.  I've read it's supposed to be an anti-war movie.  Seems more of an anti-audience movie to me.  Too dated for modern audiences.
B002LMOCJ0|5.0|Although Kevin Smith is not the most cinamatic film maker, that doesn't mean his films shouldn't be on hi-def. Fortunately, all his films have been given grand treatment on blu-ray (Jersey Girl, a non askewaverse film has not yet showed up on the format) his first film is over-due.<br /><br />First of all, Clerks is a first-rate silly-movie full of some of the best dialogue ever put on the screen - Smith is like a non-violent Tarintino. It's not for everyone, firstly it's a bit dated and second it's not the go for endless laughs sort of film like Superbad or 40 Year Old Vergin that people are now used to.<br /><br />So why put a film shot on cheap cameras, edited in a video store on a table during working hours and shot on Smith's credit-card budget? Because, you're HDTV has 1080 lines of resolution and your DVD has 480. Can Clerks ever look chrystal clear and razor sharp, nope, but can it look just like the best possible print projected on a large screen? Yes! Watching Clerks on DVD on an HDTV is going to introduce jaggeed lines and added distortion to an already grainy film, watching it on blu-ray, you see exactly what is on the original film, just like it looks on the film.<br /><br />Is it worth an upgrade??? Hm, let me see, YES!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|First off, I consider myself a true Trekkie.  Yes, Trekkie.  Trekker, Trekkie, whatever.  I'm not offended by either label.  I've loved the show since I started watching TOS with my Mom back in the '60s.  TOS is still my favorite, always will be.  It was the beginning of this fantastic voyage Gene has taken us on.  About the only series I never really watched was DS9.  I guess there wasn't enough 'boldly going' in it, being it was on a space station.  I'm sure, in time, I'll pick up on watching it.  Of course, Next Gen was my second favorite, but I also enjoyed Enterprise and Voyager.      As I said in the title, this is a new dawn for the Star Trek franchise.  Unfortunately, we all get old, and the only 'boldly going' all the characters in all the other series are doing at this point would to the head.  What has kept this series alive for so long is change.  There's no need to nitpick this movie about how it relates to Star Trek canon.  It's a new arc in the Star Trek universe.  There's nothing wrong with that.  And this movie does a pretty good job at its purpose: bringing back my Trek.  If it gets me more Trek and it is Trek -- which this movie is -- I'm all for it.
B002H3F7F6|5.0|As the first notes unfold, we are transported to a simpler time, a time when long winter nights provided a respite from the otherwise duty-filled activity of the long, daylight hours of summer and fall.  Images of soft, chilly snowflakes falling just beyond a window, an aromatic log burning in the hearth  and the introspective ponderings of what has been and what is yet to be, come to mind.  Sting lights the darkness and warms the chill by the rhythms, tonal textures and layered harmonies that are so beautifully arranged.  This is a quiet, meaningful sojourn with a touch of fancy and mirth!    Sting captures the uniqueness of  Winter's gift and provides a candle that illuminates and warms the soul.

B002QEXN2K|2.0|From the track titles, the album art and simply the title of the entire release, I was curious about 'Battle Studies'. I expected something a bit edgy and different from John Mayer, an artist that never really clicked with me musically but one who seems to have a big personality and ego that doesn't always translate into his music. Alas, the old adage of \\"Don't judge a book by it's cover\\" rang true for this release from Mayer. If you're a long time fan of Mayer and his style, rest assured, this release is for you. The music, the style, the singing is all what we've come to expect from Mayer. If you expected (or hoped) for something different, perhaps a new direction, a bit of his personality that comes through in every aspect of his life and celebrity except his music, you'll be let down by 'Battle Studies'.<br /><br />The Good: There was one song that clicked with me. Yes, just one. \\"Perfectly Lonely\\" was an uptempo, easy-listening, pseudo-rock song that had an attention-grabbing title, lyrics and music that all came together into a really good, entertaining song. The two tracks that followed it, \\"Assassin\\" and \\"Crossroads\\" were not as good but both experimented more with the vocals and instruments to provide a much needed interlude for an otherwise quiet, slow, dull album.<br /><br />The Bad: 'Battle Studies' feels weak. Perhaps this is Mayer's style but the majority of this album was lathargic and uninteresting. Perhaps Mayer puts more effort into playing the guitar than he does singing because on most tracks it sounds as if he's just speaking the words of the music in different tones. There's no passion, emotion or personality in this release or on any of the songs. For the most part, the titles have more action and attitude than the performance given on these tracks. Overall, this album features quiet, soft singing, watered down rock that gives the album more of a lullaby vibe than a rock or even an easy listening vibe.<br /><br />In all, this release is not worth purchasing. It features a host of forgettable songs and performances that probably will please long-term Mayer fans but will be a bit of a turn-off for potential new fans. This is really nothing new in terms of style or music from this artist. For an album that is supposed to take on the topic of heartbreak and love, it sure misses the mark by not conveying feeling, emotion, personality in these tracks - all key ingredients to a successful love song. Avoid this release.<br /><br />Listen To This: \\"Perfectly Lonely\\"res a host of forgettable songs and performances that probably will please long-term Mayer fans but will be a bit of a turn-off for potential new fans.

B002QEXN2K|5.0|John Mayer can always be counted on to write catchy, cerebral and heartfelt songs and his fourth CD doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />From the delicate melancholic ballad \\"All we ever do is say goodbye\\" (with awesome harmonies), the bouncy Country-tinged \\"Half of my heart\\" (with Taylor Swift), the acoustic \\"Who says\\", the Bluesy \\"Perfectly lonely\\", and the edgy and experimental cinematic-sounding \\"Assasin\\" (simply outstanding song), he provides welcome sonic variety.<br /><br />Everything stands out really, from opening cut the upbeat \\"Heartbreak warfare\\" (with quivering guitars and war metaphors for a break up; \\"Clouds of sulfur in the air/Bombs are falling everywhere.\\"), the funky Blues \\"Crossroads\\" (an incredibly groovy Robert Johnson cover),  the sunny but gentle \\"War of my life\\", the swirling sounding ballad \\"Edge of desire\\", the delicate Jazzy \\"Do you know me\\", and the Beatles-esque closing ballad \\"Friends, lovers or nothing\\".<br /><br />Mayer states that \\"The album is called \\"Battle Studies\\" because it incorporates a lot of the lessons, a lot of the observations, and a little bit of advice; Like a handbook, a heartbreak handbook.\\" A beautiful and heartfelt handbook, if you ask me.
B00136NTAI|5.0|Too bad they broke up after 2 blockbuster international albums!!  We all miss Men At Work.
B002PAQETY|5.0|Their last 5 albums have topped the charts in their native UK, and there's nothing to suggest that this, their seventh album, is about to break that winning streak.<br /><br />Kelly Jones and company have found a comfortable niche and produce catchy, edgy songs with enough flourishes/experimentation to make the next CD that much different from the last. The title of their new CD \\"Keep calm and carry on\\" is taken from a World war II propaganda poster and seems to be the guiding principle of their career.<br /><br />\\"She's alright\\" is an Rocker with shades of REM. \\"Innocent\\" is a sunny Rocker with an incredibly cathcy chorus and \\"Oooooh\\" refrain. \\"Beerbottles\\" is a choppy moody Rocker, stark and haunting with sprinklings of jangly guitars, like the soundtrack to some futuristic Western movie.<br /><br />Standouts abound on this disc; the Punk-ish \\"Trouble\\" (\\"I'm in trouble, you're in trouble, deep deep trouble's gonna burst our bubble\\"), the galloping \\"I got your number\\", the woozy Oasis-style ballad \\"Live 'n' love\\", the tender ballad \\"100mph\\" (remniscent of \\"Maybe tomorrow\\" or \\"It means nothing\\"), the gritty \\"Stuck in a rut\\", and closing Coldplay-style piano ballad \\"Show me how\\" (the latter two really showcasing Jones' raspy vocals).<br /><br />Another winner!
B001MW0J2O|1.0|Spacy, repetitive, and non melodic. I can't imagine why NPR gave this a top 50 album.  There's nothing great on any level and i'm a huge fan of weird off the wall indie type bands but this is just not good.     Note* : It appears the lovers of \\"i heard about this band before you\\" even though they're bad types have resorted to ad hom attacks because they can't argue with facts.
B002NWRMVS|5.0|Having broken up with boyfriend and long time musical collaborator Lee Alexander, Norah Jones' fourth CD \\"The Fall\\" finds her working with a new producer Jacquire King, and headed more in an edgier and denser Blues/Rock direction. It's not a dramatic makeover, subtle, but it shows.<br /><br />Opening is \\"Chasing pirates\\", a quivering soft Rock song. Similar is \\"Even though\\". Other upbeat numbers include the pulsing \\"Young blood\\" (with quivering guitars), the incredibly catchy Rocking Blues \\"It's gonna be\\" (which is so KT Tunstall sounding), and the gently galloping Country-tinged \\"Tell yer mama\\".<br /><br />Everything else is smouldering and slow, with standouts including the forlorn sounding \\"Light as a feather\\" (co-written with Ryan Adams), \\"I wouldn't need you\\", the slowly chugging \\"Waiting\\", the seasonal but cold sounding acoustic ballad \\"December\\" (really a break up song), and the Jazzy  piano/acoustic \\"Man of the hour\\" (in which she appears to sing about her ideal man till you realize she's singing about her dog), the lone throwback to her old sound.<br /><br />Her voice is as smooth, breathy and elfin as always and while fans of Norah of old may scratch their heads a wee bit at first, this should win her some new fans, especially those that cheekily nicknamed her Snorah.
B002MW50KO|3.0|It's like a reformed Grinch singing Christmas carols, but he still likes to scare little children. But, I love it. Listening to it in my car, I giggle all the way down the road. It could be considered simply terrible, but one can't deny that it is festive. I'm sure the laughter was not intended by the artist, but with his choice of Christmas classics, it puts me in an extremely happy holiday mood.
B001DWXUWY|5.0|This is a great album.<br />I've heard all of The Gaslight Anthem's songs (from this album and Sink and Swim) and there is not one song that is worse than the others. Every song is written with heart and really sounds sincere.<br /><br />Brain Fallon has an amazing voice.<br /><br />I would suggest that you listen to this cd, but don't compare it to other bands or singers. This is a truly unique band, and it has truly talented members.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|I have two educated friends who saw this movie before I did and advised me not to see it because it was \\"terrible\\".  But I saw it anyway and I thought it was brilliant.  Those two friends are still my friends, but now I know not to take their advice on certain matters.<br /><br />\\"District 9\\" isn't a movie about aliens from outer space, though it does feature them.  It is a movie about xenophobia, Apartheid, corporate greed, and other real-life issues.<br /><br />\\"District 9\\" is a movie directed toward your social conscience and, in the end, your heart.  If you only see it as just another shoot-'em-up, blow-'em-up action film, then you are missing the point.  You may enjoy it for those elements too, but if you enjoy it JUST for those elements, then you probably need to learn a little bit more about the world around you to take this film in its proper social context.<br /><br />The special effects are top-notch, and I look forward to seeing this in either Blu-Ray format or even on regular DVD.<br /><br />******  December 23 addendum *********<br /><br />The Blu-Ray contains many bonus features, but not all of them are easy to see/read.  There are \\"MNU Files\\" on the aliens and the District 9 project, but the font is so small in the detail work that you can't really read them unless you put your face right up to the television.  If my Blu-ray player had a \\"Zoom\\" feature like my regular DVD player then I could manage, but it does not.<br /><br />Also, the subtitles are in white and superimposed on the film image itself.  That makes them hard to read sometimes.  Had they been in yellow they might be easier to read.  In the days before 16:9 TV sets, everyone watching a letterboxed film had black bars at top and bottom of screen, and those were where the subtitles usually were.  Less black bar space with 16:9 sets.
B002QEXN2K|4.0|I've been a fan of John Mayer since Room For Squares and have been impressed with his steady progression since that album. In my opinion, his last album (Continuum) was a huge leap forward for him and really showed off his talent as a musician and songwriter. While this album is definitely not a let down, it also doesn't have the same evolutionary leap that his last album had. Considering that his last album was damn near perfect, it seems hard to criticize this for being too similar in style.     That being said, there does feel like something is missing from this album. There definitely aren't any bad songs; in fact, there are several extremely good songs, such as 'Who Says' (A stoner love song? Awesome!), 'Edge Of Desire' and 'Friends, Lovers Or Nothing'. However, there really aren't any heart-felt songs that match the impact of some of his previous work, such as 'The Heart Of Life', 'Stop This Train', and 'Daughters' (although the last track, 'Friends, Lovers Or Nothing', comes close). There's also a lack of catchy up-beat songs that can compare with songs like 'Waiting On The World To Change', 'Bigger Than My Body', and 'No Such Thing' (although 'Half Of My Heart' comes close).    I've been listening to this album heavily over the last week, so many of the songs that may seem a little weak at first have actually grown on me quite a bit. I think if most people gave it that chance, they would find that the album as a whole works fairly well, it just doesn't stand out like his last album did.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I saw this film in its first week of release in the theaters and with a sizable audience.  The laughs were plentiful (\\"Squirrel!\\") and the entire experience very enjoyable.<br /><br />Problem is, can that experience be duplicated watching it at home on DVD or Blu-Ray?  Mostly, but not entirely.<br /><br />The laughs are still there but not as hearty as you get in a theater full of people watching it for the first time.<br /><br />Visually, \\"Up\\" is stunning - as one expects from Pixar.<br /><br />The 4-disc Blu-Ray combo pack provides so much value-added material that it would be a bargain at twice the price.  Even if you don't have a Blu-Ray player yet, buy the Blu-Ray combo pack version because you get the regular DVD anyway and you will have all that bonus material IN CASE you ever buy a BR player.  Duh.<br /><br />I don't consider this to be Pixar's best movie.  I liked \\"Wall*E\\" and \\"The Incredibles\\" just a bit more.  But \\"Up\\" easily ranks as one of the best movies of 2009 and does the Pixar legacy proud.
9113020730|4.0|With this, the third and final part of the utterly brilliant Millennium trilogy, Larsson brings to a close the compelling story of, what must surely be, one of literature's most compelling heroines, Lisbeth Salander. As said elsewhere, Larsson ties up all of the loose ends clearly visible at the end of the second book and, as such, this is really not a standalone book but a continuation. It is essential reading for Larsson addicts but like all addictions it will never be enough to sate the appetite induced by reading the first of the series. Gobble up this one just like its predecessors - sadly, there ain't plenty more where they came from!<br /><br />Larsson's writing was obviously motivated by powerful emotions reflecting his views on certain social ills but I never, as I have with certain other writers, felt that I was being preached to. The books are moving, exciting, intelligent, compelling and superbly written (and, I imagine, translated) but above all, entertaining. However, they are not perfect!  He does tend to wallop the reader over the head with heavy doses of, what I imagine is supposed to be his version of the 'all men are rapists' mallet, every now and again, and a stronger editor would have excised entirely unnecessary sub-plots; e.g. that involving Berger and her job swap.  Nevertheless, the whole experience of reading all three is so affecting that the structural faults, most obvious in the second in the series, simply don't matter. There are just too few writers of such excellence around who can sustain the interest of their readers over 1700 or so pages and therefore his passing is truly to be mourned.<br /><br />Now I'll wait some time to get my 'fix' and then begin with 'dragon' again.
B001GCUO1Q|3.0|It was definitely entertaining, but not as good as some of the previous X-Men movies.

B002MW50KO|5.0|A classic Christmas album in the spirit of Andy Williams, Bing Crosby and Pat Boone.  I get the feeling it's the one opus Bob figured will be listened to hundreds of years from now.  Bob balanced his \\"spicy\\" voice with beautiful backup singers, ceding verses and choruses to them and then coming back in to finish the songs.  A really cool album to have and listen to every year (or every month!).
B002NWRMVS|5.0|Overall Grade: A<br />Hilights: Chasing Pirates, Young Blood, It's Gonna Be, Man of the Hour<br /><br />Since her major pop debut in 2002, Norah Jones has been fluffing our pillows and stoking the fires with her cozy hearthside tales and heartwarmingly hopeless romanticisms. At a glance one might think that the art for her latest release, \\"The Fall\\", which features our lady in a top hat and a snowy white gown sitting next to a large cuddly canine, would suggest yet another album of dessert wine pop-jazz. This is not the case. Instead, Norah sidesteps the \\"sweet\\" almost completely and heads into a more rock-based sound, for which her voice is perfectly suited. The direction is fresh and the pace is easy to settle into (with a pace set by \\"Chasing Pirates\\"). Though the album lacks a real kick-in-the-pants sort of song, it certainly delivers some of her best work to date. Expect less piano, more guitar, and the sweetest ending Norah could offer. Wonderful!
0882709194|5.0|A wonderful book.  IF you have an open mind and would be willing to change your views, then this is the book for you.  For years we have had mankind's origin shoved down our throats as gospel, but finally someone has taken the time to discus and research the other possibilities too and compare their findings to what we have always been taught.  Their findings are outstandingly clear and it finally MAKES SENSE too.

Rated purely on the disaster scenes, this creates the most magnificent havoc to date.<br /><br />That almost makes up for the bad science and mediocre scripting.

B002KREVCO|5.0|How nice of the guys at AC/DC to finally give us everything we've been missing for all these years! I had been writing these guys letters for years pleading with them to release the rare tracks and B-sides that never made the boat to the U.S. including Killer songs like CARRY ME HOME and COLD HEARTED MAN and ROCK IN PEACE... the band sent me a few nudy pictures from some forth rate aussie girl books and told me to quote \\"get a life clown. Nobody reads these letters.\\"<br /><br />But now, it seems that the band has softened up a bit in regards to all of these hard to find rarities, and it seems that maybe they have read my other letters too. Like the one I sent a few years back, asking about where the post 1990 videos were on the Family Jewels DVD. They have included a \\"disc three\\" for that set here. Totally gotta dig the videos from Stiff Upper Lip, some of their best.  And some nice archived live music to boot, on disc two.<br /><br />Now there is a crazy collectors box, that costs a milion clams, if you're hoity... it comes with an LP of the rarities and a muther flippin amplifier... some of us can only hope to either win that bit off the radio, or happen to see it fall off a truck. But this box for the less fortunate is still nothing to shake your stick at. At under thirty bucks, this has made me feel a total warmth and softness inside my heart. They really do care!
B0024RIMBG|5.0|I have in my possession the Celtic Woman audio CD for awhile, but only recently purchased the DVD. I remember the emotion that came over me listening to the music two years ago while watching the tele, and me literally taken over by their music. The girls sing with all their heart and they are very talented. Songs that particularly struck a chord with me are 'New Grange', 'Granuailes Dance', 'Dulamann', 'Carrickfergus' and 'The Voice'.     I have only a sliver of Ulster-Scot ancestry in me but this album was all that it took to bring it out in a mighty roar or just the soul of someone who knows good music when he hears it.    If you cherish Irish culture as I do and appreciate songs of passion, feet that move to a tune (Mairead the Fiddler could easily be African American with her ability to dance, uninhibited), and the sound of a symphony in perfect rhythm then Celtic Woman is A MUST!    Vinnie Kelly.
B000GPIPSS|5.0|First, my copy of this did not \\"jump around\\" and audio & video were clear as a bell, just perfect. I've not yet watched the Spanish language version, but I'm looking forward to it \\"Buenas tardes, Mina, donde esta Lucy?\\" \\"Lucy, you've got some 'splaining to do\\". Sorry, all of a sudden I thought of the classic TV show, I Bite Lucy.<br />Anyway, the Phillip Glass accompaniment was kind of disconcerting, simply because it is so clear! When I think of watching classic monster films, I think scratchy: scratchy films, scratchy sound, and scratchy upholstery on the couch while I watch KTNT Channel 11 on Saturday night.<br />So far, the extras are just great, and the \\"Universal Horror\\" feature is wonderful, especially the visits with the mayorr of Metropolis, Forrest J. Ackerman. It's  been more than 30 years since I picked up a Famous Monsters Of Filmland magazine, but seeing the artifacts gathered around FJA took me right back, sort of like the opening scenes of [[ASIN:6305080453 Matinee]] did.<br />While I REALLY enjoyed this, I'll probably never watch it again, but it was sure nice to see.

B002NOAF9W|4.0|Up to this point the Rolling Stones releases have been fair to the fans.  The Beatles recent mono remasters and U.S. compact discs can only be purchased in a box set.  The \\"Ya-Ya's\\"  expanded version brings a closure to the 1969 tour.  The quality tracks from the bonus CD would fit nicely between sides A and B of the original album.  \\"Satisfaction\\" is just that!  One of the five best live rock albums just got better.  B.B. King and Ike & Tina Turner are token opening sets.  B.B. only slips briefly playing \\"Why I Sing The Blues\\" too fast for the Stones audience.  Tina Turner is energized, soulful and Black -\\"I've Been Loving You Too Long\\".  Neither act challenges \\"Cook County Jail\\" and \\"What You Hear Is What You Get\\".  The short 26 minute DVD  brings a positive light to the 1969 tour that was lost at Altamont and \\"Gimme Shelter\\" movie.  Cameo appearances though not performing by Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and the Grateful Dead bring us back to special era.  The pricey box set has its worth depending on a listener point of view toward the original \\"Ya-Ya's\\", but I wouldn't upgrade to the album box. This is the youthful Rolling Stones at their live peak.  Luckily we can choose between the regular release and this collection.  On \\"Meet The Beatles\\" which made \\"The Fab Four\\" #1 in the world by AMERICA there is no choice.  That's my definition of a rip off.
0439023483|2.0|My friends read this book and loved it.  So I was really looking forward to it ya' know?  Well, I borrowed it from a friend, began reading it one afternoon, and guess what?  I finished it that same afternoon.  It was very interesting, until the last hundred and fifty pages.  Unfortunately, that's about half the book.      Let's take the main character.  Katniss.  A poor young girl living in a distopic society in the future.  To get food, she hunts in the forest.  With a bow.  Wait!! This is the future!!  Oh, wait, let's set it in the future but not have anything futuristic about it!  Yay!  In the beginning, she hunts with her friend Gale.  She repeatedly expresses that there is no romantic interest there.  In the beginning, she is mildly interesting, but nothing special.  Then, she is chosen for the annual Hunger Games.  The Hunger Games are a gladiatorial fight to the death between 24 12-18 year olds from all the districts of the country.  2 from each district.  Now you're thinking,  hmm, interesting.  That's what I thought.    Next, the male lead, Peeta Mellark.  He is the male from are heroines district to be chosen.  Unfortunately, he is completely unlikable.  He's dull, uninteresting, annoying, self-interested, egoistical, etc.  Unfortunately, he is the romantic interest.  HOW???????    Now, the plot.  Essentially, Katniss is the \\"tribute\\" from her district.  She goes to the arena, trains, etc.  She goes into the arena at the beginning of the games.  She runs away, not partaking in any action.  It gets interesting when Peeta \\"joins\\" a group of so called careers, who trained during their childhood for the games.  Right now, I thought, \\"Yes! Now we don't have to deal with him as a good-guy!\\"  How wrong I was to be.  Katniss runs around the arena, doing nothing, avoiding the others for several days.  Then it is announced that the two chosen from a district can win together.  Katniss, apparently obtaining newfound feelings for Peeta, begins to search for him.  Remember how I described Peeta in the previous paragraph.  She finds him, injured, of course.  In the leg, so there's not a chance of him really dying.  Naturally.  She figures out that if she pretends to have a romantic interest with Peeta, her \\"sponsors\\" will get her food, medicine, etc. by parachute.  Unfortunately, Peeta never figures out this is fake.  Except that eventually, when our protagonists have won (of course, the protagonist never seems to lose in this situation) she actually does develop a real romantic interest for him.  AAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH.      Yeah, it was hailed as \\"original\\" etc.  Really people?  Ever heard of a guy named Steven King?  Nope, guess not.  He wrote \\"The Long Walk\\"  which had essentially the same plot, without the contrived romantic sub-plot that ruins the story.      Overview:  I was sorely disappointed with this book.  I do not recommend it.

0385341008|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It took a little while getting used to the unique storytelling - letters written back and forth from Juliet to her friends on Guernsey, and Juliet to her friends in London, but once you got used to it, the story unfolded in a beautiful way. The World War II stories were really sad and heartbreaking, but the characters all had a redeeming/positive quality about them that kept the story on a nice balance. The ending was also very satisfying. I definitely recommend this book to anyone looking to find a excellent read.

B002RBZ13Q|5.0|I love the Killers! I could not find the blu Ray version in my local stores so I ordered it online and it arrived pretty quick.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|A disclaimer:  I was at the first night at Citi Field, so I watched with memories of that great performance.  I got the deluxe package from Best Buy today and intended on watching the first few songs on DVD.  2 1/2 hours later, I had sat through the whole show and felt like I was back at the concert.  Actually, there was one song that was better on the DVD - \\"I'm Down\\" interspersed footage from both the Beatles at Shea and McCartney at Citi Field.  The DVD must have combined the three nights because Billy Joel is on the DVD (and he only performed the first night) but there are no crowd scenes with umbrellas (it rained during the middle part of the first night).  Paul was greatly moved by being back at the site of the historic Shea concert and it shows in his performance.  Definitely recommended.
B002MW50KO|3.0|When you hear that Bob Dylan is making a Christmas album, you pretty much know what to expect, and this album not only didn't disappoint, but exceeded my expectations. Perhaps a better name for the album would have been \\"Your Crazy Uncle Gets Drunk at the Family Christmas Party and Starts Singing: A Christmas Collection.\\" The tone, arrangements, pronunciations, and everything were so wretched that my stomach hurt from laughing. \\"O Come All Ye Faithful,\\" which includes Dylan singing the first verse in Latin, literally had me in tears.  All I could think while listening to it was, \\"at what point during the recording process did somebody not realize that this is terrible?\\"  This album will undoubtedly bring you great Christmas cheer, and I never expected it to be musically palatable.  Additionally, proceeds are going to charity. Ergo, for a good cause and pure comedic entertainment value, I award it 3 stars. Merry Christmas to all, including the Jewish man who brought us this fabulous holiday treasure!
B002HWUU1I|2.0|I like TSS. I've seen Glen and Marketa in concert and they seem like pretty cool people. Their live performances are incredible. The soundtrack to \\"Once\\" is simply amazing, flawless even.  That's why it's shocking to have heard this album and come away numb and bored. \\"Strict Joy\\" is a real disappointment. There isn't anything on it anywhere nearly as memorable as to be found on \\"Once\\".  I will say that it's not completely unlistenable. It could sound ok as background, ambient music in a coffeehouse, but it's nothing that grabs your attention and has you coming back for more.  I don't know what went wrong with this album, but it surprises me greatly to call it what it mostly is: dull.
0060763280|1.0|This book was weak!!! It's like Stuart Smalley meets Suze Orman...If you are into the whole \\"motivational\\" books..I guess this is ok...I felt like I was watching a Tom Vu commercial....Tap yourself on the head and say \\"I am a MONEY MAGNET!!\\"..and half of the book he is plugging, of course, his seminars....I learned nothing from this book..expect that motivational speakers are rich...........

What a bargain, compared to what you pay at the book store for just 2 hard cover books, I got all five with a great keepsake box.  My son loved the secret compartment in the bottom of the box.  Recieved in the time it said it would!!

B0029XFNA8|5.0|One of the BEST Holiday movies (ever) comes to Blu-ray!!!  Now we have some of the BEST ALL-TIME Holiday Classics coming to Blu-ray.      My short list of the Best of the Best for family enjoyment available in Blu-ray are;  Leading the way is 1.) Miracle on 34th Street (1947), then 2.) A Christmas Story (1983), 3.) A Christmas Carol (1951 and 4.) A Wonderful Life (1946). These are must have movies!!    Miracle on 34th Street has been beautifully remastered in HD (1080p).  The all-star cast are even better in this feature presentation.  (better then the 35mm theater version in 1947).  With the Home theater big screen we can now enjoy these classics as they are met to be seen.    NOTE: Movies prior to 1953 are Standard format 4:3 (1.33:1)Aspect Ratio versus Widescreen 16:9 Aspect Ratio.  Also ONLY \\"A Christmas Story\\" is in COLOR!!!    This Blu-ray version of a Cherished Holiday Family Tradition has such clarity and pure Dolby Digital sound that you experience the movie in a never before felt appreciation.  I can only say WOW!!!!!!!!!    Maureen O'Hara, John Payne, Natalie Wood and Edmund Gwenn playing Kris Kringle (winning a Best Supporting Actor Oscar) are the perfect cast for this Wonderful movie.  Don't miss this Blu-ray version.    Bottomline: ALL THE SAME EXTRAS/SPECIAL FEATURES AS THE STANDARD VERSION (EXCEPT THE COLORIZED VERSION).  In my opinion the original movie presentation personifies the message of the feature and introduces us to story and characters.    I highly recommend this feature for your Holiday Home Theater Library!!!  IMMEDIATELY a family tradition with multiple viewings each year GUARANNTEED!!!    ENJOY!!!!
0316001821|4.0|To be quite honest I had never heard of this book until I saw the trailer linked from Twitter in reference to the moving coming out next month. After watching the trailer I said to myself \\"wow that had to have been a book first\\", a little tiny search on Yahoo brought up a plethora of results and I am happy to say that Sebold's book is the second I purchased on my Sony Pocket Reader. I tore through this book in a day, staying up into the night to finish it. It brought me out of my funk of not reading after having the baby and put me back on track. I am so happy to have read the book before watching the movie.<br /><br />The story follows fourteen year old Susie Salmon from her after life as she deals with her rape and brutal murder. She resents being killed and wishes her murder to be brought to justice. She also wishes to relive her first kiss and have many more, she wishes of course to have grown up. We watch her family crumble under the pressure of having a child murdered, her school friends grow up without her. How everything evolves except for Susie who is stuck just watching waiting for her murder to be captured.<br /><br />This is a lovely story that will keep you on the edge of your seat, and will also make sure you lose some sleep due to the fact you cannot put the book down. Don't watch the film without buying a copy first!
0061719544|5.0|This man is a delight to watch and now I can say a delight to read.  Very honest and heartfelt, especially when it comes to his feelings about becoming a citizen.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|This movie isn't for anyone with bad lungs, because I nearly died laughing while watching this movie! It really takes the spirit and the feel of all the other Austen movies and does what any fan has ever wanted to do and puts you in the story. If your a die-hard that is worried about people messing with the book, don't worry, you can really tell as you watch this movie that the cast and crew are also fans and they have treated the original story with respect and love. I love this movie so much and it will leave you cracking up hours after it's over!
B001OQCV24|4.0|The calendar of the ancient Mayan civilization predicted a great global change to occur on the 21st of December in the year 2012.  Not surprisingly, this very date has been the subject of extreme debate amongst scientists and theologians, as we edge closer to that portentous date now just a little more than three years ahead of us.  And suppose this date was a warning, that the world as we have known it will come to an end?  This is at the center of \\"2012\\", another mega-budget apocalyptic mayhem from director Roland Emmerich, who had given us THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW and INDEPENDENCE DAY.    The fact that this is not the first end-of-the-world film ever made (the theme was explored in sci-fi movies at least as far back as the 1930s, and became more widespread with the proliferation of nuclear weapons during the Cold War) is no deterrent to Emmerich, his cast, or his special effects technicians; they make the most out of a plot that has an extremely large solar storm somehow causing the Earth's geophysical structure to collapse, causing an ever-escalating chain of cataclysms that eventually climax with the Apocalypse.  At the center of it all is a failed sci-fi writer (John Cusack), his wife (Amanda Peet), the scientist (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who predicted the sequence of mega-disasters, and a series of arks being completed to house the last remaining human and animal life after The End.  Despite a few lapses, notably Woody Harrelson doing a rather ridiculous and over-the-top nut job role of a government conspiracy theorist with a Manson-like stare, look, and voice, \\"2012\\" soon puts the emphasis on Cusack, Peet, and their kids, as they try to get on the U.S.-led ark as the world collapses.    To put it mildly, there's no real subtlety present in \\"2012\\" as there was in the earlier 2009 doomsday drama KNOWING, since Emmerich's filmography shows him to be more of the Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay school of destruction filmmaking than anything else.  And as so often happens inmega-budget films like this, the action and the plausibility of the plot are often stretched to the breaking point (as with L.A. and San Francisco both swallowed up whole by the Pacific plate, a pivot point of the NBC-TV miniseries 10.5 and 10.5: APOCALYPSE).  Beyond that, however, and the fact that Emmerich is not another Steven Spielberg, the film nevertheless has solid performances from Cusack, Peet, and Ejiofor, as well as solid turns from Danny Glover (as the last American president), Oliver Platt, and (in a minor cameo role) George Segal.  And, of course, the total obliteration of the world is rendered with frightening impact, borrowing every single CGI trick known to Hollywood, and bits and pieces from every sci-fi/disaster opus made since the heyday of the genre in the 1970s.    In all good honesty, \\"2012\\" is not a masterpiece.  But in terms of providing insane special effects bang for a cost of hundreds of millions, it might as well be.
B0015AARJI|1.0|The duel shock 3 PS3 controller had to be returned. It was greatly flawed. It did not work. It is of the old design. It should be discountinued.
B00026WU4G|4.0|As some reviewers have indicated, this is likely the first album brought up in conversation when people speak of Dylan's 80's work, and for good reason.   It has some really powerful songs (Jokerman, Neighborhood Bully, and Sweetheart Like You, to name a few...).   It also has some less-than riveting stuff.   Some do consider this a perfect album, but most I've encountered give it somewhat mixed reviews.   I agree that song-for-song, there are stronger collections of of Dylan's material out there (Highway 61, Freewheelin', etc.)   That said, I'd still have to single this work out as the most convincing of Bob's electric albums up to that point in his career, just in terms of sheer musical compatibility, and balance between singer, song, and band.   Knopfler and crew play behind Dylan with a sensitivity and an awareness of his style (particularly his singing) that is second to none.   And for Bob's part, he seems to feel right at home in this musical setting, as he rides the band's beat with some of the most graceful (his scruffy timbre notwithstanding) and playful phrasing I've heard him do in a while, singing (and swinging) off that backbeat like he'd worked with these guys all his life.   The way they all seem to breathe together every single second of each song is just beyond belief.   Trust me...if THIS had been his backup band at the 'infamous' Newport fest gig back in the 60's (or a band exactly like this one), he probably would have gotten a much different reception than well...what he actually got.   Certainly before the end of the first song many folks would have settled down, and by the second, everyone would be listening.   Speculation, yes, but...    So forget about whether or not every single song is gonna knock you over the way some of the older classics do.   There are still enough bona-fide gems on here to remind you of why this album is still potent all these years later.   If you're interested in Bob Dylan's electric work, this is an absolute must-have, and if you simply want to make sure you have all of his greatest songs, then you need to include this album as well, for the first three cuts alone rank right up there with his very best.   And there are at least a couple others that come close.
B002NWRMVS|5.0|This is excellent new music from Norah Jones.  I love the cover photo with the dog by Autumn De Wilde.  Jacquire King is the  producer of this record.  He brings in some great musicians to perform on this album like Erykah Badu on keyboards.  Elvis Costello lends his talents playing the guitar. Every track sounds unique and different in tempo and musical arrangement.<br /><br /> My favorite track is \\"Man Of The Hour\\". This is a song about looking for that special someone.  The lyrics are pretty funny. \\"Even Though\\" is my second favorite. I love the drums playing.  \\"Chasing Pirates\\" is a song with great piano playing.  This song is about how the imagination can go wild chasing pirates.  This is a good first single.  \\"Tell Yer Mama\\" is a song that makes guys seem dumb, but I love the sound of this tune.  \\"It's Gonna Be\\" is a gritty sounding track.  I love the sensuality in Norah's voice a lot.  This song is a gem.<br /><br />\\"I Wouldn't Need You\\" is a superb love song.  This is a song about how people need each other. \\"December\\" is a slower song.  This song is very soothing and pretty.  I love the acoustic guitar playing here.  \\"Light As A Feather\\" has a spiritual quality in the lyrics that I like.  \\"Back To Manhantan\\" is the prettiest song about cheating on a loved one I have ever heard.  I love The Fall by Norah Jones.
1582701709|5.0|The huge success of Rhonda Byrnes book \\"The Secret\\" speaks for itself. In reading some of the reviews I must admit it appears that some are simply \\"reactions\\" rather than true reviews. I found Ms Byrnes approach to be remarkably engaging and certainly provokes thought. Her references again and again to \\"Avatars.Teachers, and great Leaders through the ages shows she has painstakenly researched the truths that have had some of the greatest impact in the lives of significant numbers of people. She is not offering her insights or rather her restatement of old truths as a new manuscript of reference to compete with or replace the Bible. To me what she covers in the book are things many of us have discovered in our lives or the lives of others to be true. This is the crux of the matter, if something is true, there is a reason why it is true. If something works it becomes an established principle that repeats itself again and again when the principle is applied. It does not matter who said it or how it was said if it is effectual in it's results then it has special significance. In watching the video and also reading the book, I was impressed with the energy and inspiration that was being expressed. It certainly was not negative energy or blasphemy against God. It was a treatise of encouragement in positive thought, faith, love, and expectation of doing more, experiencing more, achieving more and with an almost childlike faith an obvious confidence that good things will come forth.  Without going into detail the emphasis on the \\"law of attraction\\" proves itself in the lives of people everyday and has done so through the ages. I liked the book and found it beneficial. Does it cover all the points of doctrine or my personal beliefs in ways perhaps I am accustomed to? No but that does not appear to be its purpose. With one broad sweep the book covers some of the most important truths that can bring some of the greatest changes for good in peoples lives. That seems to be the real issue, has it helped anyone? Apparently, it has helped thousands in many different ways. We may have our various religious positions but sometimes some things are presented in ways that differ from our personal approach and yet they may produce enormous beneficial results. To me \\"The Secret\\" is one of those things. No one is asked to leave their church, turn their backs on the Bible or become members of any new kind of cult, they are simply reminded of things that have been known by some through the ages that are powerful when applied in one's life.

B002AR9YPI|5.0|Wow. Saw these guys before ever having listened to them, and loved it. This album is better than I could have hoped for in terms of capturing some of that spirit.  Some tunes are reminiscent of the more gentle moments of Abbey Road, Sun King in particular.  Great going guys...please keep it up!
0064430227|5.0|It's a great, great book! don't hesitate to buy it for kids who are just beginning to read!!
B002MW50KO|4.0|I got this album expecting to laugh hysterically at what I'd be hearing, but boy was I surprised!  The song selection is traditional and well put together.  The backing vocals and orchestrations are delightful.  'Must Be Santa' is an absolute hoot to listen to.  I give production value an A+ on this one.  If you go into listening to this one with the idea of it being the guy you stand next to at any community sing-along, you'll have a great listening experience!  Way to go, Bob!  Thanks for making a great contribution to helping Feeding America!
B00122IYJY|5.0|I can still go back to this album after listening to it for 30 years and hear something new.  Nobody could play guitar like Eddie, nobody could sing like Dave.  Just one word WOW!!  If you're going to get one Van Halen cd in your life, GET THIS ONE!!!!
B002NWRMVS|4.0|Four stars for the nice songs and that amazingly silky voice. This is a beatiful album that will fit right in with Norah Jones' previous cds.    But I must admit that as I listened to songs, I wondered how much better they would sound if Jones had stuck with her old style of instruments and arrangements.     I was determined to listen to this cd with an open mind, but my mind continued to go back to her old style. But any artist must move forward and take chances. That's exactly what Jones has done with this collection.    And this is still better than almost anything you'll purchase for musical entertainment. Sit back and enjoy that amazing voice.
B002T921AC|5.0|My World is a very good cd. Love Justin Bieber, voice, his vocals are great, the two videos, are very nice, when you play, the cd, on your computer. I can see why, the girls, would love, this 15 year old teenager. He looks great. Five star all the way. I bought nine, cd's so far. I've given some cd's away, to women friends, and the first thing, they say is how cute, and good looking, Justin is. The cd also has a poster, of Justin. Great value, a must buy. I believe Justin Bieber, will be a star , for a long time.

B001AVCFJM|5.0|This movie IS Star Trek.<br /><br />The faces and the sets may be new, golly- gee, and all whiz-bang, but the essence remains pure Star Trek.<br /><br />JJ Abrams has breathed new life into an old friend. Yes, there are many new things here, but there is plenty of refrences to all that has come before, especially a scene early on in Spock's life that paod homage to the somewhat unjustly decannonized Animated Series.<br /><br />Kirk's somewhat hinted at rough and tumble attitude in the original tv show is explored much more deeply and extremely here, wich may upset some of us older fans, but I absolutely loved the bar scene with Uhura and the cadet rat pack.<br /><br />I usually don't like the idea of someone tampering with an Icon, especially one that I love as much as Star Trek.<br /><br />But I concede that I must make an exception here.<br /><br />JJ got it right.<br /><br />Let's hope he can keep it up.<br /><br />OPDATE:<br /><br />As statewd above, despite the whiz bang factor, I really like the new Trek universe that Abrams has given us to play in. It is far grittier and much more violent than the old one, wich I will always love, but the possibilities in Abrams ST universe will indeed take us where no one has gone before, If Paramount allows it to grow and flourish.<br /><br />Will the Klingons change yet again?<br /><br />Will the Borg show up, and if they do, will they be even nastier than they were in TNG?<br /><br />Will the Vulcan race survive?<br /><br />Not to mention the Federation itself?<br /><br />Well, if nothing else, it's gonna be one Hell of a ride.
B002KDUDG6|1.0|Not what was expected.  Somewhat boring. May not play another time.  Would not recommend to anyone.
B001AVCFJM|1.0|I love Star Trek and always have. However, this movie was complete garbage. People say how great it was, and how it was going to reinvigorate Trek. Well, you should have been worried when Abrams said he was more of a fan of Star Wars. Because guess what? We got am almost exact 'Clone' of Star Wars Episode IV.<br /><br />Let's see we start off with:<br />1. A amall ship being attacked by a larger ship:<br />Star Wars = Tantive IV vs Star Destroyer<br />Star Trek = USS Kelvin vs Narada<br />2. Which directly leads to a farmboy living with family and dreaming of space:<br />Luke with Owen and Beru<br />Jim and his mother<br />3. Then he meets an older wise man who knew his father and then asks him to join some crazy space mission and visits a bar:<br />Obi-Wan Kenobi<br />Captain Pike<br />4: Then has to go on a rescue mission to save someone on a big ship with that partner he originally hated but ends up becoming really good friends with by the end:<br />Han Solo<br />Spock<br />5: Then they end up destroying the evil large ship that can destroy planets:<br />Death Star<br />Narada<br />6: Then medals are given out at the end in a big ceremony.<br /><br />Wow, original thinking on Abrams part.<br /><br />Plus the way they think that to make Kirk more accessible, he has to come from a single parent home, be a thug that starts barfights, oh, and now the Enterprise is being built in Riverside, Iowa now, which has always been Kirk's home. Kirk always represented the best of humanity, what we strove to be. He was an overachiever often succeeding even in no-win scenarios, but of course it's been replaced now, because apparently it was boring. We have a ship that looks ridiculous, the nacelles look like something off a 50's era car, and the bridge looks like an Apple store.<br /><br />So the only thing Nero cared about was revenge on Spock. Never once considering that he could simply solve the problem and use the Red Matter to destroy the star that would eventually cause Romulus's destruction. How about the fact that with Vulcan destroyed and only 10,000 Vulcan's left, there is an imperative to breed and repopulate. This leaves a very small gene pool, and the only option to prevent stagnation is to mate with humans or other compatable humanoids. In this respect, Spock, who has always been portrayed as the outsider, now becomes the template of hybridization.<br /><br />And now the other problems to be faced. V'ger and the Whale Probe are still heading to Earth in this film, and they never explained why the ships were so much more advanced looking. They should have at least made it so that 23rd century Starfleet somehow got 24th century technology. Abrams blew continuity out of the water as well with all the original crew being on the ship. What? Are they all the same age now? The original timeline had him born in 2245. So in this movie set in 2258, he would have been 13, are you serious? But guess what people, in the new film he's been born four years earlier, which would biologically be impossible, since the sperm that created the original Chekov wouldn't have existed yet.<br /><br />Ridiculous film, bad copy of Star Wars and a disgrace to what has come before.ft, there is an imperative to breed and repopulate.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|I think it is funny that several of the negative reviews begin by saying \\"I'm a long time Star Trek fan...\\"  Well, so am I!  One of the things that made Star Trek great back in the \\"old days\\" was the way it was always cutting edge, and looking for a new approach while living within the set \\"laws of the land\\" of the series.  You know, I don't really need more of the \\"old\\" Star Trek, because I already have plenty.  Those are classics and shall remain so.  I'm ready for something new, and this movie is it! It makes Star Trek cutting edge again.  I'm very excited at the prospect of seeing more from these new actors and found it amusing that the writers created an alternate time-line where none of the old episodes or movies even have to fit in anymore.  Clever!  Sure, it's a quick and easy way to break the mold, but like I say...I've already got plenty of DVD's in the old mold.<br /><br />The actors were all great!  They brought a new energy to the old characters.  Sure, there are a lot of new special effects and razzle-dazzle, but that is a PLUS.  I don't need to watch Klingon destroyers fly in slow motion for 15 minutes (already have that).<br /><br />Basically, there are a few old fans that will pooh-pooh this movie and not even sit through it because of their predetermination to hate it.  Let them.  For every old fan that throws this in the trash, I promise there are two or more new fans taking their place. I've talked to many friends who never cared for Star Trek, but they loved this movie.  I think the reasons why are clear.  It's a lot of fun!  I'd have to say it's the best science fiction movie since \\"Serenity\\" and that is saying a lot.
1591841666|2.0|I'm on page 50 of the book and I'm ready to disagree with Seth. Before I do, I will say this...He is correct on the fact that in every endeavor, the exciting and new feeling with dissipate. When the romance leaves, its up to you to stick it out and fortify your position on what you set out on doing. But its not necessarily a conscious decision.<br /><br />What I disagree with is this...in the book, Seth says that when you're mediocre at something, quit. This is a paradox in itself because if you quit, how are you supposed to get better at it? After getting through as much as I have, I believe that in the concept of \\"the dip\\" Seth is referring to, a genuine love for what you do persists when the dip happens that makes you overcome. Seth confirms this when he talks about his blog taking 5 years to become really big and that he was doing it because he enjoyed what he got out of it, the feeling of having organized his thoughts. Seth became what he is today because even if nobody ever read his blog, he would still be doing it.<br /><br />Seth also keeps alluding to winners and losers like life is a game, it isn't that simple. I don't like how he approached this because it defeats his whole premise on quitting strategically. Who is gonna wanna quit after he just spent 8 pages talking about losers?<br /><br />If you take anything out of this, take this: that in every endeavor, relationship, or project, the dip is inevitable. The dip is there to test your love for the very thing that you are doing because it helps you grow as a person every day. Winners do what they love because they love what they do. If you don't love something now, something will come when you are prepared enough and aware enough.
0547260695|5.0|Opening the cover of any new book comes with a feeling of great anticipation, however, the thought of seeing how Exupery's art would be made into pop-up cut-outs accelerated that feeling into one of almost surreal joy. Fortunately, I wasn't disappointed. The illustrations are beautifully rendered and the quality of the materials are to be appreciated. I especially am grateful that the story is completely unabridged, leaving the words and the feelings to carry on to work their magic for years to come.     I've purchased an additional five copies to give as collectible gifts to others whom I know love this tale of life, love and death. It is certainly a must-have edition for any collector of pop-up books, classic children's tales or philosophical classics. I cannot recommend it highly enough.
B00004SZWD|5.0|This album is a rarity.  I cannot think of another double disc album that has no filler whatsoever.  Also, \\"Love's in Need Of Love Today\\" is one of Stevie's best opening tracks.  The opening line \\"Good morn or evening friends, here's your friendly announcer..\\" perfectly sets up the entire album.  Other standout tracks include \\"Have a Talk With God\\", \\"Sir Duke\\", \\"Pastime Paradise\\", \\"Ngiculela\\", \\"If it's Magic\\", \\"I Wish\\", \\"Isn't She Lovely\\".  Do you notice how many songs I have listed?  The whole album is not only filled with standout tracks, but they are perfectly sequenced and blend in with each other exquisitely.  If you like Stevie Wonder but don't have any of his albums, this is the one to start with. Then, pick up \\"Music Of My Mind\\", \\"Innervisions\\", \\"Talking Book\\", \\"In Square Circle\\". and \\"A Time To Love\\".  These albums represent the best of the best.
B00011KHTM|1.0|I'm on my second adapter.  Returned the first one after using it teaching a class only to discover that the loose fit in the usb port resulted in no signal to the overhead projector, which was essential for my class.  So I got a new one at the Apple store.  And now, I'm in the former Soviet Union teaching another political science course.  And the adapter is just freaking out.  Two days ago, it would send a signal to the projector.  But yesterday?  No.  Today?  Nothing.  The connection is loose at the usb port - a manufacturing flaw.  What am I supposed to do now?  One hopes that there are competitive products out there that do the same thing.

B001GF7WRW|4.0|First off, these headphones are very well made and feel as though they will last quite a long time in spite of the large amounts of plastic used in the construction.  There is only a single cord which is marvelous for tangle-prone people like myself.  Also, the headband encompasses even my large head and I daresay these would be the most comfortable headphones I've owned if it weren't for one problem.      My ears tend to stick out from my head, thus, after long periods of usage, my ears begin to ache and I am forced to take a several-hour break.  Therefore, if at all possible, locate a pair of these headphones and try them on before purchasing.      The only other minor annoyance was the open-backed nature of the headphones.  Of course, this will hardly matter to most, but if you are used to closed-back headphones, the difference is both noticeable and slightly annoying.  Do not buy these headphones should you fall into this category.    In spite of these two caveats, I use these headphones heavily and can easily recommend them to anyone looking for quality.
B00278U1W0|5.0|Being a long time Clapton and Traffic fan, both artists separated and of course, together with Blind Faith, i must say that my expectations where high. This, regarding the quality, the song list, the performance, even the session musicians. I can say that this DVD is a must have because you will hear Clapton's hits, sung by Clapton and Stevie, also Traffic hits, sung by Stevie, joined by Clapton and of course, the Blind Faith songs.<br />I loved the compilation and the songs they chose. Also, a brief introduction to some songs where precise and correct, with respect to Buddy Guy's passing away.<br />The video quality is amazingly good, you can see Eric's sweat or the imperfections in the keyboard players sweater. I did not listen the audio with DTS or something like that, but with Stereo is superb, no need to lower or higher basses and trebles. Precise.<br />Regarding the performance, excellent, Eric's solos are always enjoyable and Stevie's keyboarding is still sweet.<br />I can assure you won't get disappointed in buying this DVD, because it has everything.
B0012QE4Q2|1.0|This movie played with history and the sisters motivations for doing what they did were muddy.  While some of the actors were good (Scarlett Johanssen, Kristin Scott Thomas), the 2 main characters were not very believable.  Hated Eric Bana as Henry VIII.  He had no fire or passion and wasn't arrogant enough.  And I just could not believe Natalie Portman as Anne Boleyn.  On the whole, skip it and watch The Tudors.  Much better and in more depth rendition of same topic.  Also, you could go back in time and rent/buy A Man For All Seasons if you really want to see Henry VIII (Peter O'Toole) and Thomas More (Paul Scofield) go at it.
0312370849|5.0|I was on vacation when I started reading this book; I couldn´t put it down, so I read it in 1 day. The part where Sarah discovers her brother shocked me. I can imagine this novel adapted as a film. Some producer has to look at this possibilty. It would be excellent! I would have gave it another end but it's pretty good. If you do want to read a story which has real history mixed with a little bit of suspense, secrets, power, evil, love, fear, hate, read it. You won't regret it.
B000P12LWY|5.0|For those who missed it on Showtime, this was a really in depth look at the England of the time and the politics of religion.  The costumes were gorgeous the writing was smart and the acting was superb.  I'm a big fan of Jonathan Rys Meyers and he lived up to my expectations here.  He doesn't really look like my preconceived notion of Henry VIII but he more than made up for it by getting the attitude and arrogance just right.  The rest of the cast was also amazing - Anne Boleyn, Cardinal Woolsey, Thomas More, Catherine of Aragon - were all played intelligently and beleivably.  Left me eager to catch up on Season 2 and 3.
0312370849|5.0|Upon recommendations from three friends I ordered this book. So glad I listened to their advise. I found I could not put it down and finished it within three days in between numerous other obligations. Heartfelt story line..disturbing but true. I felt Sarah's pain throughout the book and put myself in her shoes and wondered how I would survive the tragedy she experienced. Needless to say it's a story that touched my heart and although fiction..it easily could have been someones life in the summer of 1942 in Paris!!!
B0000646UN|5.0|I have always been a WW2 enthusiast,but I never knew this battle took place,we were never taught about this battle in school.  All I have to say is,this movie is a must see for anyone who is interested in WW2 history,I don't know how accurate it is,but war is hell.
B001TOD92C|1.0|Vats vith all dis running, jumping, flying and spritzing?    This is alright for a nice Irish boy like Mickey Rourke, but for me you can forget about it altogether.      Listen, I wish Mickey Rourke a lot of luck.  With the one star I'm giving his movie, he should live and be well.  But, personally, and believe me no one asked my opinion, personally, Mickey my boy, the running, the spritzing, the jumping and the flying through the air, without even a trapeze or a trampoline already, what? you need this?  They couldn't have given you a part in a movie where you were maybe a nice Irish priest or, as a stretch, a quiet, thoughtful rabbi?    What, after all, would such a role require?  You sit around, you talk, you have a meal.  If outside cars are chasing, bullets are flying and buildings are exploding, what do you care, you're inside counting the house.      Okay, so maybe not a priest or a rabbi, but next time at least play a guy who wears a suit.  For such a role you'll break not one bone, you'll chip not one tooth, and you'll hurt not one tuchas.  Instead -- you'll sit, you'll talk, you'll do, you'll make.    If you play a businessman, you'll smile, you'll schmooze, you'll sit behind one of those feency-schmeency desks, and you'll rob people blind.      Come lunch time, three martinis, more conniving, then you'll take a spritz in the sauna, you'll strip to the waist, and the girls will go wild.      But Mickola, boychick, all this leaping and yelling, and in tight pants no less.  Let's face it, a spring chicken you're not.  I see here on my Commodore 64 computer that you were born in 1952.  Back  That's so far back, I was dating Sophie Tucker at the time.  Ho boy!  Now there was a wrestler!      But, what? you asked me about her?  Of course not.  What do you care what I did with Sophie Tucker and what she did with me.  (Sigh.)  What we're here for is for one thing and one thing only: to put your career back on track, to get you back on your feet again acting-wise.Yes sir!  With my help we need to find you some peppy-perky part, some part where you're safe, you're unhurt, both feet are on the ground and where nobody in the movie makes a face where it looks like they ate a bad lox.  Okay?  So it's settled?  You'll listen to me?    So now, if I may, let me give you some advice, even though it's true you never asked me, even once. ... Mickola, listen to me now,  I didn't get to be 96-years-old banging my head in the middle of a facockta wrestling ring. ... I didn't get to be 96-years-old pumping iron.  Pumping Sophie Tucker, among others, believe me, that was more than sufficient. ... And while we're on the subject of coronaries, I didn't get to be 96-years-old having a heart attack trying to schtup Marisa Tomei.  (She Jewish?  You could fix me up maybe?)    What, you think I got to be 96-years-old jumping on people like one of The Flying Wallendas?  (God bless him, the father, Abe Wallenda, I knew him.  The s.o.b., he owed me money.  But what the hell, he should land and rest in peace.)     Mickola, make a long story short, so that I can finish already and take a nap; in a few words what it comes down to is this -- SLOW DOWN, MY BOY!  Smell the bagels.  Have a cup coffee.  Eat some dairy.  You want to exercise?  Fine.  Hit a ball, punch a bag, chase a puck.  But, please my boy: jumping, flipping, spinning, flying -- not for you.      Instead, a part that requires extensive and repeated schtupping,  what's the expression nowadays? -- \\"go for it, man!  Yeah, baby!\\"     A part where you play a crooked goniff -- you have my blessings.   After all, in these difficult economic times, kids need role models.  How are they going to know how to hand people the short end of the stick unless they see it in a movie?  ACTING!  That's the ticket!  That's what it takes!    Lemme see, I got it.  How about a remake of \\"Fail Safe\\"?  Huh?  You like it?  Now there's a movie where you're  going to be ... safe.  Without fail.  (Did you see?  Did yousee what I did there?  Fail / safe.)  *Safe.*  This is the operative word.  No jumping, no colliding, no flying through the air like a crazy nut-boy.  All you do, you get on the phone, you make small talk with some Russian, you order out for deli and, before you know it, all the bones you broke in this mishugah wrestling movie -- good as new!           With a nice safe, calm, quiet movie, your career will make a big comeback, your star will skyrocket like if I swallowed a bowl of Viagra already.  (Did you see what I did there?)    Till then, trusting all is well, and let's hope you put a few dollars in the bank,      Your pal,    Yasha \\"The Body\\" Banana

B00008EY9G|5.0|Here is a film--the term \\"movie\\" is not good enough for this product--\\"Identity,\\" which will have 340 reviews after I hit the \\"Publish\\" button and I had not heard of it until I picked it up from the Sale bin at a local wholesale giant. This is film making at its best.<br /><br />Oh, 2003, the year the film came out--also, the year of my retirement, my divorce, new house, trip to Ireland, seminary--no wonder I am not familiar with this film. I was too busy with my own identity. \\"Identity\\" is such an apt title, too, for this film. Initially, I wondered what its meaning might be, but the story is so taut and full of action and never-let-go-roller-coaster-ride into the psyche that one forgets the title. Too much else to consider.<br /><br />First, the story opens somewhat in the middle with important information provided. The viewer may not have any idea what this information means until much later, when it's too late (not that the viewer can do anything to help). Director James Mangold proves his title along with great editors in organizing the various plot elements into a sophisticated, cubist fashion. What seems chop, chop is not at all, but becomes a careful rendering of truth and reality, fantasy and the unreal world of horror where the characters walk and breathe. Identity. What is it? Who has it?<br /><br />Mangold takes the viewer to a brink, but a brink to what? You cannot guess this one. Part of what makes the center hold is the casting. John Cusack creates one of his better roles and convinces us he is this character. Each character and the actor who plays him/her are well-drawn and made flesh by other talented actors-- Amanda Peet, Ray Liotta, Rebecca DeMornay, Alfred Molino.<br /><br />The setting is a motel. The time is night. All the circumstances are morbid and sinister. Who is this man who runs the motel? What's wrong with him? The movie star, tired and aging, continues her demands for more and better. Her chauffeur who is more than he seems has hit, I should say his vehicle hits the wife of a man changing his tire in a relentless storm that has encircled this group of disgruntled, sad people.  After the grotesque murders begin, Peet's character likens their story to \\"And Then There Were None.\\" I would suggest that these people have found themselves in a twisted Lovecraft horror tale.<br /><br />For twisted and horror describe the hidden part of the story.

B001FB4W0C|4.0|I thought the first season was a little moronic and too teenage like.  However, I stuck with the show and kept watching and it is greatly improved.  It is a little scary, but a good bottom story about the brothers and their Dad is worth watching.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|I remember watching this movie as a young lad. As all of Disney's early films, it \\"enchanted\\" me. I purchased this film and watched it again just recently and happily found it just as good (if not better) then I remembered it as a child. This story has very strong moral values about being honest and telling the truth and the consequences we will face if we choose to do whats wrong. With beautiful animation from the \\"golden days\\" of Disney, this classic tale will charm and warm your heart for year's to come!
1590171993|5.0|\\"stoner\\" is a beautifully written poem....... or is brilliantly poetic prose    written in 1965 it is both clean and incisive. the writing brings you into, then out of, the late 19th and early 20th century. it's as if thomas hardy or theodore dreiser had the ear and pen of john williams, for the story is filled with naturalism.    no matter, naturalism today is the new minimalism and the clarity of purpose in \\"stoner\\" makes for a wonderful read.    the story of a prairie family with a son sent to college to learn agricultural improvement techniques quickly becomes the story of a passionate lover of literature. william stoner's love affair with english literature never ceases, although his depressive nature will not allow him any other long term happiness.    inserted into the story is a wonderful discussion of \\"mind and body\\" being one, although they are often at war within a person. there are learned, scholarly discussions woven in as well....medieval and renaissance bards being the early precursors to more modern and even current poets.    \\"stoner\\" is a very quick read....please read it.

B00006FDCD|3.0|Although packed with a star-studded cast, the movie version of Stephen King's \\"It\\" fails to deliver a shutter of the suspense, horror or blood colored drama of the book.

6305736650|5.0|A timeless tale set on the coast of West Africa, the action, love, and suspense cannot be ignored or forgotten.  Two lovers torn apart by a twist of fate years ago in Paris are reunited in Casablanca.  Their meeting is a mess of bad timing, life-altering secrets, and unmistakable passion.  Can they be united forever?  Can love conquer all?  Casablanca is a backdrop where these questions are tested while the lives of many hang in the balance.  A superb performance by both Bogart and Bergman, this classic will last through the ages as one of the best love stories the world has ever known.
B002ELM5HY|5.0|Mark Knopfler is a brilliant songwriter who can evoke a time, a feeling, a memory, or a life as well as anyone. But it's his playing that knocks me out and literally moves me to tears. He is one of the rare musicians recognizable at one note, but there is not the least bit of self-conscious virtuosity. He is neither understated nor overstated, just absolutely spot on, every single note, every single song.

The whole novel people such as the CIA director and the Architect can't believe what will happen if Mal'akh succeeds in his plans and then you get to the end and, I don't know if I speak for everyone, but I was like \\"Really?\\"  The couple twists in the plot were average at best.  The very ending of the book didn't wrap anything up.  The Noetics science had no real coherency with the book.  This book was too concentrated on every single mundane detail about everything that it took away from the story altogether.  Don't feed me details that give nothing to the story.  I waited 5 years for this book to come out and I'm highly disappointed.  The only thing that is worse then this book is when Ron Howard gets his hands on it and screws it up even more while making it into a movie.
0312360258|1.0|\\"Marked\\" follows the progression of Zoey Redbird, a fledgling vampyre in a world (parallel? future?)where vampyres are a fact of life. They're separate from humans, they're dangerous, but they're here, and there's nothing to do about it.<br /><br />Zoey's an interesting heroine. A normal teenage girl, she is reluctantly chosen as a vampyre, which basically means she's separated from her family. Zoey's also quite believable within the parameters of the story.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Zoey is the only likeable part of this book.<br /><br />While the opening sentence is certainly a gripper, the book swiftly falls flat from there. The writing is much too lean, and it seems unskillful; the progression is a little too fast, there aren't any smooth transitions--it's always very jarring, jarring enough to let you know you definitely are reading, and aren't lost in the book--and with the exception of Zoey, nobody's a sympathetic character. In fact, ALL of the sideline characters are incredibly shallow. Neferet is the deepest character after Zoey, and even she's a stereotype.<br /><br />For instance, Aphrodite is so openly self-centered that, from her first or second sentence, I wondered if I was reading a bullying scene written by a 2nd-grader. Most of the writing style is like that, but Aphrodite saying, \\"This place is awesome because of me\\" is so incredibly stupid, even for a villainess, that I almost stopped reading. Aphrodite can easily be a nasty character without throwing it in our faces that like. Having to be so obvious is a mark of bad writing; if the writer has to tell that tidbit, and has no way of showing it for the reader to infer him or herself first, then there's a problem.<br /><br />Also, Zoey's friends are just as unbelievable: one's the hick-stupid country girl, her human best friend is so without depth, so snarky and vapid, that it was boring; and even her love interest is your basic two-dimensional hero template. Excluding one dirty scene early in the novel, he's the boy next door--without anything to his personality or history beyond that. NONE of them have any personality beyond stereotypical high school roles. It's not that fitting the high school roles into this story is bad; in this novel, which has the potential to be funny, it could have been hysterical. But instead it's only ridiculous.<br /><br />The plot is also so insanely juvenile. While you expect high school drama here--it's a vampire boarding school-- you would think the underlying plot would be deeper, or at least not so submerged in adolescent melodrama.<br /><br />I do apologize for the severity here, but for any reader who likes story depth and character development is going to be so disappointed. The story was shallow, a thin plot developed in time to cash in on the vampire craze, an excuse for more adolescent fantasy in relatively clean book-form. I know we all need escapism, but I do think it could be better than this. The writers could have done much better; I don't know why they welshed here.<br /><br />I'd advise you to skip it. Still, take this with a grain of salt; one man's trash, and all that.

0156027321|5.0|Life of Pi, a skillfully written novel by Yann Martel, is an interesting piece of literature that grabs your attention and pulls you along with his original story about the instinct of survival and human nature in the face of death. The character of Pi, the hero, encourages, enlightens, and thrills the senses every step of the way.  In the beginning of Pi's saga, a description of Pi's life with his family is mentioned. He was raised in a zoo, literally. His father owned the Pondicherry Zoo in what was French India. Piscine \\"Pi\\" Molitar Patel was named after a swimming pool in Paris, France. Pi also introduces us to his various religious beliefs and his pious lifestyle. When his family decides to move to Toronto, Canada and sell all of their animals, Pi is uncertain about the changes it will bring into his life. They set out on a ship across the Pacific Ocean. In the midst of a storm, the cargo ship on which they ride, sinks, leaving Pi along in the middle of the ocean with a hyena, a crippled zebra, an orangutan, and a tiger, all on one lifeboat. Soon all of his companions are killed except for the tiger. To survive, our hero must train the tiger to believe that he is the dominant of the two. How Pi manages to survive this journey which takes over 200 days is an amazing accomplishment of the human nature.  This novel is a really good insight into human nature in general. It provides ways in which to look at yourself, not just Pi. As you watch the battle between the elements and Pi's own personal integrity, you are struck with a realizastion of how powerful the circumstances can be on a bedraggled soul. The language of this book is easy enough to read for young readers, yet has many multiple connotations for those who yearn for a mind-probing excursion into the realm of the human mind through fiction. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys a unique and compelling story.  Each person goes through a period in their lives when they make the decision tohang on to life, to love, to believe in God or to forget who they are inside and forsake their love for life, the desire for love, and the longing to fill the gap where God once was. This story portrays the trial of the soul and the struggle of the mind against the worries of this world and the essence of grabbing for that invisible hand that is so much stronger than our own.

B002KDUDG6|5.0|Fantastic. This is one you will play over and over again. My favorite cd in a long time.
B002LITRTO|4.0|The beginning of this book got off to a slow start.  At first I thought it was going to be a book about a bunch of middle schoolers,  but then the story went to present time.  I don't think that this book is for kids.  It's more for older teens,  there is mention of sex among teens as well as alot of underaged smoking and drinking.  I personally liked the book, and would recommend it to older teens.  It's a fun read about four girls trying to cover up secrets from middle school.  Their friend disappeared three years ago and things happen throughout the book that have them suddenly thinking about her, and what could have happened to her.  Each character has their own personality, which I liked.  You start to find out how they grew up and why they are the way they are.  It's funny, it doesn't occur to them that if they were to come clean about what happened when they were kids, they probably wouldn't be in that much trouble.  Especially since they were kids.  Again I liked the book, but parents BEWARE.  The brightly colored covers with the pretty pictures make them appear as though they are marketed to younger teens and kids. But they really aren't.  I would recommend reading it first before handing it to your kid.
0307346617|3.0|This is the apotheosis of escapist fiction.  Almost completely devoid of character development and style, World War Z is nonetheless an entertaining exposition of the effects of a worldwide zombie outbreak.  And no one is better qualified to write such an account than Max Brooks, author of The Zombie Survival Guide.      The novel consists of snippets of interviews with \\"survivors,\\" through which the reader learns how the outbreak began and how humans organized themselves to fight the zombies.  Obviously, reading this book is not an intellectual enterprise, but you have to be impressed by the thought that Brooks has put into the psychological, technological, and economic implications of zombie war.  The zombies themselves are a mystery: Brooks never reveals how they reanimate from the dead or how they \\"work.\\"  Still, he reveals enough icky details about zombie ecology to make them the best-developed \\"character\\" in the book.      Brooks displays great competence within his specialty of zombie fiction, presenting a fully imagined scenario and maintaining enough suspense to keep the reader turning the pages.
B001KVZ6FW|3.0|I never got around to seeing this movie in the theater.  I purchased this movie and watched it at home.  From the commercials it looked like a fun uplifting movie for all ages.  They never gave any indication that the movie was very sad and heart-wrenching. I didn't expect it to be so sad. Not to mention that the villain was a little creepy.  That part may be a little scary for some kids.  The dogs were very anoying and so was the bird. Parents may have some explaining to do during and after this movie (death, cancer, grief, miscarriage, why the villain is shooting at a kid). I'm not saying I didn't like the movie.  I did.  But I think Disney could have marketed it differently. I think parents should view it with their small children.  It's a very sad movie with a happy ending, but the events may be a little to difficult for small children to understand.    The animation was fantastic. But the story left a little to be desired.
B00151QYSU|3.0|I rented this DVD based on the silly commercials I had seen about a guy who could fast-forward or mute through the parts of his life he didn't want to mess with. Looked like a fun family night movie. BOY, was I WRONG about the family part! We sat down with our 10-year-old and found ourselves watching a movie full of hilarious ADULT situations. From the busty nymphomaniac friend whose three divorces resulted from her cheating on her husbands with their brothers, to the series of family dogs shown \\"humping\\" a stuffed duck, to \\"fast-forwarded\\" sex scenes, a light-hearted romp through the main character's actual conception and birth and ensuing comments about the size of his male parts....LOTS of things I really didn't want to have to explain to my grade-schooler. Had it just been my husband and I, we would have watched it to the end. With our child in attendance, however, we turned it off at about the halfway point and popped in a Disney flick. The movie is rated PG-13, but I think should definitely have been rated R. It could have been done without all of the adult situations and been a great family movie about priorities and accountability. The producers, however, chose to make this a raunchy adult romp in line with Caddyshack or Animal House.
0307266303|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone with foot pain, back pain, or knee pain who likes to exercise and or run. Not only is it helpful, but also a really interesting read. I could not put it down. The Copper Canyon Indians are fascinating people,as are all the people who run extreme marathons, and the author tells a good story. I may never run a marathon,but since reconnecting with my (bare) feet, I have no more plantar fasciitis or back pain. My workouts are once again a pleasure.
B000063JDE|5.0|Many people praise films becuase of the impact it has had on their emotions. Many also praise films because of the true meaning that underlies the imagery. Blue Velvet has made a busy man like myself sit and take the time to write a review. This film will open your eyes, change your perspective, and re-evaluate the things you take for granted everyday. I bought this David Lynch tour-de-force on a whim - I had been a fan of Eraserhead for a very long time and this masterpiece completely devoured me from the opening score. The imagery will literally rip your eyes open as the darkly melodic themes float around your visual shock.            First off, kudos to Dennis Hopper on portraying one of the most mind-blowing villians that I have had the pleasure of viewing- Frank Booth. From his shock-inspiring first appearance to his final demise he portrays what truely evil people fight with the most-themselves. His self-doubt is evident throughout the film and his choice of cover is a ruthlessness not seen since my first viewing of Max Cady in Cape Fear. From the way his face contorts when inhaling though his mask to his unstable, rage-driven personality, it is a performance like no other i have ever seen.           Speaking of great performances in this film, I cannot help but include my favorite seven minutes of the entire movie, led by none other than the great Dean Stockwell. His portrayal of \\"Suave Ben\\", Frank's pansexual partner in crime, will haunt your mind for days. I could not believe how disturbing his character was. The man that i had watched in so many Quantum Leap episodes literally blew me away with such a bizarre and terrific semi-cameo appearance. Watch how him and Frank interact in that short sequence- it is blatantly obvious that Frank looks up to Ben and we are only left with our ideas as to what kind of person Frank would admire. Chilling, indeed.          In closing, Blue Velvet will give you an entirely different feeling the next time you listen to Bobby Vinton's song of the same name.      PS- As I had mentioned Eraserhead before, watch for Jack Nance's fiendish little role as Paul, one of Frank's thugs.
0316044695|1.0|If you want to experience a horribly written memoir of a guy who can't seem to conceive of an America that exists outside of right-wing Christian east Texas, by all means read this book.  But if you're looking for a thoughtful discussion of the nature of patriotism, personal sacrifice, the limits of human endurance, and the implications for a democratic nation fighting an asymmetrical war against a very nasty adversary, you can do far better elsewhere.    Hats off to all of our soldiers, no matter what they do, who have sacrificed to keep us safe and free.
B002IYEQR4|4.0|First, kudos to Snyder and WB for announcing before the earlier DVD release of Watchmen that an Ultimate Cut would be released, providing a date, and following up on it.  Anybody that did the research wasn't hurt by a second release of this film.    Onto the product itself: this version of the film is incredibly faithful to the book, and both my girlfriend and I found we preferred it to the Theatrical.  The added material from the director's cut and Tales from the Black Freighter both add to the layers of the film.  What made the original comic book so epic was the multiple layers that the story worked on, and the ultimate cut really showcases as much.  The special features are also great, however that's also where this set is less than perfect.    Including the complete motion comic is a wonderful addition.  However, the digital copy with expiration date is fairly useless, and I would have much rather had a disc that allowed the viewer to select either the theatrical version or the director's cut.  My only other gripe is that \\"Under the Hood,\\" which is included and is a wonderful addition, leaves out some of the best material from the original book and could have been included.  I realize the filmmakers couldn't include everything from the book, but the suicide at the auto-garage with the music playing in the background would have been wonderful to include.
B001LF4IA6|4.0|Bruce Springsteen's Working On A Dream is the follow-up to his 2007 release Magic.  Whereas Magic had dark overtones and a sense of dread, Working On A Dream is a more optimistic album, although sadness does creep in from time to time.  The album's opener is an exercise in sonic bombast, the spaghetti western styled \\"Outlaw Pete\\".  The song is one of the better sounding efforts on the album, but the lyrics are a little over the top.  \\"My Lucky Day\\" is classic Springsteen with a driving guitar base that wouldn't sound out of place on The River or Darkness.  The title track is a homage to President Obama and is so likeable and earnest that you can forgive the silly whistling break in the middle of the song.  \\"Queen of the Supermarket\\" has a nice sound, but may go down as having the worst lyrics to any song in Mr. Springtseen's vast catalog.  \\"What Can Love Do\\" is a solid rocker while \\"The Life\\" evokes memories of the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds with its layered textures.  \\"Good Eye\\" is a strange blues inspired song that finds Mr. Springsteen utilizing a voice distorter that he used on the live version of \\"Reason To Believe\\" on the Magic tour.  While that was extremely effective in concert, it just sounds odd on this song.  He rounds nicely on the lovely \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" which has a pretty shuffling beat.  \\"Life Itself\\" and \\"Kingdom Of Days are two, more or less, by the numbers songs that are good, just not great.  \\"Surprise, Surprise\\" is a straight up Wall of Sound production with a swirling, layered sound scape that explodes out of your speakers.  \\"The Last Carnival\\" is a moving tribute to the late Danny Federici that Mr. Springsteen sings with true feeling.  The album closes with \\"The Wrestler\\" a song Mr. Springsteen wrote for the movie of the same name.  It is a sparse, mostly acoustic number with lyrics that perfectly capture the essence of the film.  It is the best song on the album and one of his best of the decade.

B000RRIAA8|4.0|Boy is the album that introduced the Irish band to the world. The band were basically still teenagers at the time of the release and the album has that sense of urgency and earnestness that one feels at that age. This is the band's chance at the big time and they don't want to let it slip through their hands. \\"I Will Follow\\" is a powerful blast of rock and roll that percolates and pounds. \\"Into The Heart\\" is almost mystical in its delivery and \\"Another Time, Another Place\\" is a ripper. The album has an airy sound in places such as on \\"The Ocean\\", \\"Twilight\\" and \\"The Electric Co.\\" while songs like \\"Stories For Boys\\" and \\"Shadows & Tall Trees\\" have an endearing naivete to them. Boy is chock full of promise and potential and the band proved they were up to the task of reaching and fulfilling that promise and potential over the course of their career.
B002QEXN2K|3.0|I read all the lyrics before listening to this album first.  The lyrics are angry, sad even a little depressing.  From the words I was reading I thought this album would showcase some guitar angst.  For example the song at war with myself has great lyrics, not just great it could be anthem.  The problem is it has a pop like feel good arrangement.  I wish John could have found his inner Pete Townsend, Jimmie Page side to this song.  They would never take serious angst and turmoil lyrics like the ones he wrote and arrange the music so sweetly.  Think about the Who's won't get fooled again energy?  The guitar assault of on Zeppelins Immigrant song?  John can really play the blues and really rock when he wants to why did he hold back on the record?  I know I am being a little hard on him here because there really are some beautiful songs on this album.  I hope when he tours he re-arranges some these songs and plays loud and angry.
B0013LPS8Y|5.0|War is the most overtly political album of U2's career. They touched on political subjects on their first two albums, but on War they take up arms. The album opens with the anthem \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" which finds the band outraged at the situation in Northern Ireland. \\"Seconds\\" is about the nuclear arms race. \\"New Year's Day\\" is an apathetic song about despite all the rhetoric, nothing really changes. It contains a lovely piano and strong Edge solo. \\"Like A Song\\" is another anthem-like song, a declaration for solidarity. \\"Refugee\\" finds Larry Mullin providing a pounding drum beat to a fierce Bono vocals and Adam Clayton bass gives \\"Two Hearts Beat As One\\" it's driving backbone. Despite all the anger, \\"40\\" closes the album on an optimistic note. The song is based on Psalm 40 and the band states that there is chance for peace and understanding all though things are bleak. War broke U2 in America as it was their first top twenty album. They shifted away from making another album this political, but War's spirit still continues to permeate their work. The deluxe edition is easily the weakest of the reissues so far.  It is mostly made up of remixes that don't add anything to the songs.

B002JTHFV2|5.0|The Unforgettable Fire marked a distinct turn in U2's sound. It was the first album to be produced by Daniel Lanois & Brian Eno and the album has a fuller, more ethereal sound as compared to their earlier work, but there is still that sense of rebellion and immediacy. The album's single \\"Pride (In The Name Of Love)\\" is great example of the combination of the sounds. It has a driving beat, but with the Lanois/Eno production, it has a much fuller sound than say a \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", but is no less powerful. \\"A Sort Of A Homecoming\\" is a beautiful, lush song that opens the album while \\"Wire\\" and the title track are pulsating, powerful songs. \\"Bad\\" may well be the best song the band has every done.

The bonus disk has some nice rarities including the four songs that made up the Wide Awake In America EP that features two stunning live performances of \\"A Sort Of Homecoming\\" & \\"Bad\\".

B002R4K6AG|1.0|Bob Dylan: I'm done. I have enjoyed your songs since your first album but couldn't handle the one before this one. And, as for this one, what were you thinking - or smoking? I always liked your voice, but here, you sound like a half-dead frog with laryngitis. I'd be afraid to play this for little kids. It even creeps me out. You have been an American icon, and rightly so, but, I'm done.
B001D2AYCI|2.0|I bought this for the SACD mentioned in the description. However, after receiving it, I found that it does not contain an SACD, but a standard DVD (not even DVD-Audio). I did a little research and discovered that Paranoid was never released on SACD. THE DESCRIPTION IS WRONG - NO SACD. I contacted Amazon about the blatant error, and they responded with \\"...blah blah blah, talk to the seller...\\" They didn't even acknowledge the erroneous description that I brought to their attention. I noticed that another review mentioned that the error was corrected, but as of the time of my purchase, and of this writing, it is still wrong.
B002BSHWUU|1.0|On September 17, 2009 I ordered \\"The Beatles Stereo Box Set\\" because when I ordered it Amazon.com said that it was available.  Shortly after the order was in I was informed that it was out of stock and would not be available until late October ... I was then informed that it wasn't available until early November and when I finally did receive the Box Set one of the CD's was missing.  I've tried to get someone on Amazon's end to get in touch with no one will get in contact with me.  This is the second time that I have been ripped off from this unsympathetic company, the first time was when I ordered the re-mastered version of Eric Clapton's \\"Another Ticket\\" and received the original version.  I will never purchase another item from this company because I've been ripped off twice and no one will do a damn thing about it.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|There are certainly twists in this film I did not expect to see (then again, I don't think anything could have prepared me for the 2nd half).  It is brutal, cruel, sadistic, and yet very real.  We hear about these kinds of things happening, yet rarely have 1st-hand experience (thank goodness for that).  I guess it goes to show that, in the lack of a soundly edified social structure keeping a close eye on one's actions (or better yet, when micro-societies possess the power to recreate their own set of rules), the ideal excuse for releasing the primitive beast inside is rendered.  Could we all be seeking silently for that one instance in which all repercussions are lost, and sadistic impulses redefine our very course of action?  Within the context of a very well encapsulated delusion envisioned by an obviously deranged person, the breath of existence is reduced to satisfying the whims of ignorance.  Now, the most important thing to resonate, no matter how utterly humiliated and physically/psychologically fragmented one becomes, the absurdity of reality will obviously take care of everyone, but one can still muster up the power to have the last laugh, as is evident in this film (without giving anything away, especially since this conclusion is highly subjective).  Anyway, it is a very difficult film to endure, and I think that it allows one to see beyond their own taboos.. but then again, isn't that the primordial objective of watching movies in the first place?

B002SEW5WW|5.0|I wasn't sure OneRepublic could do much better than Dreaming Out Loud, but Waking Up is awesome. I haven't decided if it's BETTER than Dreaming Out Loud, but it was definitely worth the wait. It was a smart move to make \\"All The Right Moves\\" and \\"Good Life\\" their first two singles from this album, as they are probably the best songs on it. However, the beginning of every other song on the album automatically pulls you in; the songs are captivating. The instrumental arrangements are excellent, and it's nice to listen to lyrics that have meaning. Ryan Tedder's vocals are top-notch. Recommended song: \\"Marchin' On\\".<br /><br />*I only write reviews if I am absolutely in love with a product; this album is worth writing a review for.

WOW. I would urge everyone who wants to purchase from Amazon to first check if rldgear sells it. If you want an honest and reliable seller, I would stongly advise going through him. I know I will make it a point to do so.
0061914177|5.0|I have rarely felt the need to review a book or even comment on it after a read. I don't believe I've ever left a review here, which will likely be obvious.<br /><br />In short, I loved the book. I bought a copy locally the week it came out, then ordered another through Amazon to pass along to someone else. It is a very brief read. It could be read anytime a spare hour or two is found.<br /><br />If you aren't familiar with Gary Vaynerchuk, this book does cover his background pretty well. I had heard of Gary about a year ago through a blog or online mention (Tim Ferriss, I believe). I saw a few minutes of his show but wasn't very interested because I don't drink wine, so I didn't care about the topic of wine (like he VERY obviously did). He seemed kind of funny, but I was too busy to watch a show about wine, and didn't think much more about it.<br /><br />A month or so prior to this book being released, I began to hear this \\"wine guy\\" pop up among people I associated with online and in meatspace. I watched a short keynote speech he gave at an event about Web 2.0. In the video, he gave a passionate, cussword-laden speech about the nature of business and changing times. Everything he said was very spot-on.<br /><br />\\"Crush It!\\" is an expansion of his business keynotes, filling in a bit more detail about the how and why of the changing business world.<br /><br />Being in business used to be a lot more difficult when the gatekeepers of the big media outlets were the only game in town (radio, tv and print). The little guy could perhaps compete on a very local level, but it took huge dollars to get seen by the masses in years past. With the largely free tools available to anyone with access to the internet, you can get your brand seen by more and more people every day.<br /><br />This is in no way a \\"Get-Rich-Quick\\" book. The 3 major tenets in the first chapter of the \\"Crush It\\" methodology are:<br /><br />\\"Love your family.<br />Work superhard.<br />Live your passion.\\"<br /><br />Hardly a get-rich-quick strategy unless you skip all the parts where he talks about working until your eyeballs bleed instead of playing video games or watching tv.<br /><br />Several times throughout the book, he talks about the realities of how hard you will have to work to make even a decent living like you may make at your current job. As he says, if you are even 1% unhappy with your job, you should work to change it. He does NOT suggest quitting your job to become a blogger. But if you want to change and do something you love, work your ass off after work until you can get to that place.<br /><br />Hard work and hustle is the theme of the book that he never lets the reader forget. He goes into more detail about starting out for the person who may be completely new to the \\"social media\\" scene. It is not a detailed \\"one size fits all\\" approach to what specifically every person should do for a living. There are several examples of possibilities people could follow that can open eyes, and more than enough to get them started. It's not about selling chachkies and passing that off as a living. It's about working hard, becoming known as an expert in your field and doing something your grandkids will be proud of.<br /><br />Everyone has something they are passionate about. Something we would be doing if we didn't have to be working (that job that makes you unhappy. If you're 100% happy this doesn't apply). There are ways to do what you are passionate about, and make a decent living doing so. You may not get filthy rich doing it, but there are so many ways to make a living, it only makes sense to use the tools we have nowadays. They have made it far simpler to get started than in the past.<br /><br />I've been involved with the tech world since well before there were computers in every household and mobile phones existed only in the movies. The tools that now exist and the eyeballs that are on these platforms Gary discusses are changing the way business is done.<br /><br />It's still a big deal for Gary to get on the Today Show and do a little sniffy-sniff with Matt Lauer, but advertisers are spending more and more money on internet platforms. The numbers of people watching each is changing daily. The little guys without the big dollars the mainstream media channels have available are able to be competitive in this rapidly-changing world. Money follows the attention. More attention is on these internet tools every day.<br /><br />Work your face off, and you can build a business that thrives, doing something you love to do. This book is a good starting place to start getting the ideas flowing.<br /><br />I don't work for Gary, have never met him, and am not being paid to say any of this. I still don't drink wine, but when it comes to business, I agree with him. As busy as he is, he answers emails and twitter comments. If there is anything you find unclear about the book, he tries to answer any questions.att Lauer, but advertisers are spending more and more money on internet platforms.

B002HWRZH0|5.0|The movie is 5 stars. It took me over 4 hours to watch all the special features. JJ knows how to make special features. The picture quality on the Bluray is Jaw dropping clear. I think it looks even better then in the theater.<br /><br />Now for the statue, very, very cool. Solid metal. The ship is brushed finished, the stand is all shiny chrome except for the inside of the badge symbol is more a brushed finish. It's pretty awesome. My only thing, I expected it to be taller, from the pics, it just seemed taller. Not a deal breaker, just shorter then what I had in my mind looking at the pic for 3 months.<br /><br />Oh and the certificate of Authenticity, would have been nice if they were numbered 1 of 5000, they are not.

They have a long way to grow but the ingredients are here for the most part.  Still has too much of the surf guitar sound of early 60's CA rock for me...but is moving towards the Rolling Thunder of 1968-9.  \\"Anthem of the Sun\\" captures Rolling Thunder well for studio...  Live Dead, DP 4, and Fillmore West (1969) IS Rolling Thunder
B002QEXN2K|3.0|Man, Mayer is such a talent both vocally and especially on the guitar. As a guitarist of 14 years I can say he's just that good. This is why it saddens me to say this album is just plain mediocre for him.    There are so many possibilities with this album but it just falls flat. How can you take crossroads, a total classic, and dumb it down like this? The near garage band grunge sound is totally over done. I do love the accompanied guitar solo on top but it's just not enough.    What about the song featuring Taylor Swift? Unless featuring means \\"she sings one chorus line and that's it\\" then yes she is featured. What a waste, honestly.    It feels like the whole album is like this: simply lacking. I absolutely loved \\"Who Says\\" the first few times I heard it. Hmm, why does that song sound familiar? It's because it's almost identical to Stop this Train and even Heart of Life. (I haven't confirmed it but it also sounds like the Beatles Blackbird.)    So, I gave the album a 3 because a 4 is too high and a 5 is reserved for albums like Continuum.
B0000024Y3|4.0|The virtuosity on this cd is beyond dispute, buit I feel it comes at the expense of finer melodic sensibilities often.

Lacks the ebb and flow more mature musicians have.  Still good, historically influential.
B001KVZ6G6|3.0|This is the first Pixar movie that I didn't totally love.  The movie starts out great and appears that it will be a fun and sensitive look into a life lived, goals planned for but postponed and sharing love through it all. Unfortunately I think that about 2/3 the way through the movie the Disney execs walked in and said \\"this is too boring, only old people will appreciate this and our target audience is the 8 year old male. Put more stupidity in and be sure to have lots of bodily fluids, 8 year old males love bodily fluids, I mean look what it does for Dreamworks!\\". So the chance is missed, what could have been a great movie that would be treasured for years ends up just another piece of tripe. THe ironic thing is that no 8 years old will be happy sitting through the first part of the movie and no adult will like the last part of the movie. One can only hope that this is an aberration in an otherwise stellar path for Pixar. One can only dread that the DIsney marketing and audience research experts have taken over Pixar and all we will see going forward is more tripe. (OK, after hearing from folks I upped it from 1 star to 3 stars)

This book should be recommended reading to all teenagers for its educational value in knowledge of Greek gods and myths.
0743497465|4.0|If you have read Dan Brown before you know he is all about the conspiracy, and mystery, and suspense. In Deception Point, you can expect to find all three of these and more. Differently than in The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons, Deception Point does not focus on religion, and yet it is just as controversial and thrilling. Deception Point is a typical piece by Dan Brown, and that is a good thing. The story is filled with twists and turns and mysteries that both the reader and characters have to solve. To be honest, the book is hard to put down. You get sucked into the story and into the characters lives and are itching to know what happens next.<br /> As in Brown's other books, he is so convincing of his story that even though the reader knows that it is fiction, part of you believes that this is possible. NASA as a conspiracy is totally possible, considering not many people know the intricate details of what goes on inside of NASA. Brown provides such information that the reader is almost convinced that NASA is a conspiracy in reality. This has caused controversy with Brown's other books, but it is part of what makes his novels so intriguing. You are never sure what is truth and what is fiction with him, and that's why his writing is so well received by his readers. If only he would continue to produce books such as this, he will be very successful with his future books. Just be warned that if you pick up Deception Point, be ready to not put it down.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|This cd has recieved mixed reviews, but I have to say, it is wonderful.  Her songwriting is impecable and very emotional. It's hard not to hum along. I obviously loved it. And her new cd, \\"This Fall,\\" is equally well crafted. I would recommend both to anyone who likes good music. Anyone.<br /><br />1st rate, damn fine songwriting!<br /><br />-Murray Dunlap
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Pre-Ordered this about a month back thinking it would save me a trip to the store, and that it would arive close to the release date, today.    The DVD didn't even ship until today, the day it was scheduled to be released, and the expected deliver date is 11 days after that.  I have pre-ordered DVDs in the past and they have always been shipped so that I would receive them on or near there release date.    I would not recommend pre-ordering from Amazon.com unless you don't care when you receive the movie.    Wish I would have gone to Target to get it.    Very disapponted in Amazon.      I won't be doing my Chrismas shopping here, I would hate for my gifts to be delivered in January.    Alan

0156027321|4.0|Do not let the image of a young boy and Bengal tiger cause doubt for this captivating tale; the impossible may stand in question, my friends. The Life of Pi was and is truly an unpredictably unique experience as a reader. Yann Martel takes the reader far into the world of instinctual survival, provoking the quest of faith and leaves the story and the reader with one question: to believe or not to believe. . .      Doubtfully will one ever find a character such as Piscine Molitor Patel, a native Indian boy swooned by faith and microcosmic zoo life. Nicknamed Pi, he was not only the second son of Pondicherry's zoo keeper, but also son of God found in Hinduism, Christianity and Islam. At the most pivotal time of his life, Pi's family and a select of zoo residents leave India and set sail for Canada aboard the Tsimtsum, a Japanese cargo ship. The Tsimtsum sinks at an unbelievable rate, leaving Pi as the one surviving castaway in a lifeboat the size of a shuttle bus, accompanied by a hyena, an injured zebra, an orangutan and one impressive Bengal tiger. As his only life force being adrenaline and fear of meeting his death to the sea, or worst, the jaws of a zoo animal, Pi witnesses the up-close gruesome details of predator v. prey. Left with the tiger and his loss of familiar possessions, Pi resolves he must carry on the will to survive. The life of Pi, castaway somewhere in the Pacific Ocean and lonely companion to the majestic tiger, thus unfolds. With knowledge of zoology and driven by the faith in God, Pi experiences the most dreadful imaginable and the most mind-blowing unimaginable.   Martel's words are enough to suffice as a tasty treat--eye candy. The eloquence in his figurative language provides a continuous connection to any theme of the story and underlying messages. These messages, including finding your inner strength to combat fear and setting your experiences free, are easily comprehensible, yet powerful and take attentive thought to absorb. At the end ofeach few chapters or so of reading, I found Martel's words, or messages rather, correlating to any situational life experience. The philosophical relationship he creates between animalistic behaviors, both inhuman and human, and the power of faith is the effervescence of his magic. Upon reaching the end of the story, I was much satisfied. What was questioned in the beginning as something that was unexplainable at first sight was answered by the end. However, a new question arouses: how true are Pi's experiences?   For any one interested in the feat of adventure, to experience inspirational longevity of strength and taste the grace of masterly diction, I would admirably recommend The Life of Pi. For here stands a story that will lead you on a journey to the unimaginable, and as a reader it is up to you to believe his enchanting tale.
0198326769|5.0|I read this book because a local book club was reading it, along with the book that I wrote, \\"What They Could Not Forget: Memoirs of Leo and Wjera Ringel\\". [[ASIN:0615196624 What They Could Not Forget Memoirs of Leo and Wjera Ringel (paperback)]]    The concept of discussing two authors approaching the subject of the Holocaust in two totally different ways, spurred various heartfelt discussions. They were discussions of innocence VS maturity, yet for both, the atrocities were inconceivable.    This book was an easy read, yet incredibly thought provoking. I could hardly put the book down. It grabbed my heart. I also watched the movie and was not disappointed by the book or the movie.     All books are not \\"historical accounts\\", yet the thoughts and discussions brought on by \\"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\\" are just as provoking as those brought on by non-fiction. In this book, it's the innocence and Bruno's family dynamics that are up for discussion, not the historical facts. In various ways, I believe that all families can relate to the dynamics of Bruno's family, in one way or another, to one extreme or another.        Bruno's innocence, cradled in his family VS Schmuel's reality of a brutal, temporary existence thrown in this death camp is as stark as black VS white.    I think this should become a reading staple.

0307716988|3.0|Unfortunately this book only delves a little into Michael's view of his life as an entertainer. It's a pretty simplisticly told summary of how MJ got his start, but it's not an especially exciting or interesting one. I only see the value of this as a collector's item after his death because we don't find out much more about him than we probably already knew. Oh, and the pictures are nice. Would I buy it again? Sorry to say, probably not.

031236198X|5.0|Heard OUR ICEBERG IS MELTING by John Kotter and<br />Holger Rathgeber . . . this is a short, yet insightful fable about<br />a group of penguins faced with a potentially devastating problem.<br /><br />Though I don't usually like animal stories that show what humans<br />are like, for some reason this one struck home . . . I could relate<br />to the characters in the story, Fred, Alice, Louis, Buddy the Professor<br />and NoNo, particularly because they were so similar to individuals<br />I have encountered in my life . . . you'll recognize them as well.<br /><br />You'll also be able to relate the story to change that needs<br />to take place in your company or organization, and how to<br />implement these \\"Eight Step Process of Successful Change\\"<br />that were originally developed by Kotter at the Harvard Business<br />School:<br /><br />Set the Stage<br />1.

This passage, taken from a technology company's \\"About Us\\" section, highlights what Dan and Chip Heath refer to, in their book \\"Made to Stick\\", as \\"the Curse of Knowledge\\".<br /><br />\\"Don't Be Evil\\" is the way Google defines its mission. Southwest? \\"We are THE low-fare airline.\\" Google and Southwest are two complex companies that have been able to reduce their message and self-identity into simple and powerful core messages that help to guide the actions of not only their employees, but also of their consumers.<br /><br />To combat \\"the Curse of Knowledge\\", and provide messages both simple and profound, the Heath brother's suggest that readers use the \\"Six Principles of Sticky Ideas\\" or SUCCESs (Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credentialed, Emotional, and Story). A salesperson, teacher, doctor, researcher, preacher? Doesn't matter. We all stand to gain from making our ideas stickier.<br /><br />In \\"Made to Stick,\\" the Heath's attack corporations, individuals, and other communicators for inundating listeners and readers with messages that fail to resonate. They laud those that adhere to time-tested principles that jive better with the way that the human brain is hardwired.<br /><br />Take for example Subway's famous \\"Jared\\" ad-campaign, and compare it with their preceding campaign, \\"7 subs with 6 grams of fat.\\" The Heath's argue that understanding the \\"Six Principles of Sticky Ideas\\" would have made it easy, ahead of time, to know which of the two campaigns were going to resonate more with audiences.<br /><br />The \\"7 subs with 6 grams of fat\\" is abstract, fails to tell a story, and doesn't target human emotion. Is 6 grams a lot? What does this mean for me? The human brain is not hardwired to remember numbers. But it can remember stories. So to communicate how Subway can be a healthy fast food alternative, Subway decided to tell the story of an obese college student, who decided he needed to lose weight. This college student decided to reduce his diet to two Subway sandwiches per day (a tuna and a veggie sub), and combine this new diet with an increased walking regiment. This student was named Jared. And he lost over 150 pounds!<br /><br />The story of Jared resonates with audiences, because it shows how Subway subs can lead to a healthier life, rather than merely telling audiences. Sticky ideas, after all, are easy to remember.<br /><br />The Heath's principles are nothing revolutionary in the field of rhetoric, PR, or advertising. Like Malcolm Gladwell [[ASIN:0316075841 What the Dog Saw: And Other Adventures]], the Heath's are mostly rewording old social psychology and rhetoric findings into a new, more accessible, popular format. This book has no new ideas. But the co-authors should be lauded for condensing into an easily digestible format the principles they espouse. The accessibility of the ideas in \\"Made to Stick\\" can be a powerful reminder to us all (from the Corporate PR Specialist to the bridesmaid in need of crafting an effective, moving wedding toast) that it is often not what you know that matters, but rather how well you can share what you know. The Heath's reiteration of old principles is a testament to those principles' timelessness.ract, fails to tell a story, and doesn't target human emotion. Is 6 grams a lot? What does this mean for me?

B002MW50KO|1.0|As with cilantro, to some folks it IS the taste of Mexican, to others it tastes like soap, such as it essentially is with Bob Dylan and me.  Having grown up through his whole career, I never caught on to him for as much as I always tried.  I really tried to listen to this Christmas CD.  I just can't get past his voice, phrasing, singing, mouthing, whatever you want to call it.      Dylan ruins Christmas on this effort.  I played it for relatives on Christmas Day and we all had a laugh until it just got too annoying to continue to listen to Dylan massacre these songs.  The age mix of the listeners was from early 20's through late 60's.  The music, backup singers, and arrangements are good, it's Dylan that ruins it all.  To this day, I still do not understand the over emphasized appeal of this guy.  As a lyricist, fine, as a singer or even as a \\"lilting spoken word phraser\\", puleeze!    There are a ton of folks here who gave his CD five stars. ...and I'm a guy who has quite the eclectic mix of music in my collection and will listen to practically anything for a good find!  You enjoy, not for me.  Sorry Bob, not my cup of mulled cider...
0385341008|4.0|\\"Letter writing is the only device for combining solitude with good company.\\" ~Lord Byron<br /><br />This book is about the occupation of the island of Guernsey during World War 2, but more than anything it is about friendship and how suffering can bring people together. The character development is without question the strength of the book. It is full of quirky and congenial people. Really I love reading any book about World War 2; I just find it so fascinating, and this was definitely a different perspective than what I have read before.<br /><br />The writing style was unique in that the book is basically the letters that the characters write to each other. Sadly, my generation may be the last one to have enjoyed receiving a letter in the mail with the advent of the Internet and email. It's just not the same. Letters are much more thought out and personal. That may be why I liked this book so much.<br /><br />If I cared about romance, I might say that it felt like a great build-up for a somewhat disappointing climax, but I don't, so it wasn't a problem ... I recommend it.

0375842209|5.0|\\"Because I could not stop for Death --  He kindly stopped for me --  The Carriage held but just Ourselves --  And Immortality.\\" ~Emily Dickinson    I was somewhat reluctant to read this book. I have read quite a few books about WW2 recently and I find this period to be fascinating but also very depressing. I have to take these books in small doses; however, all the rave reviews finally compelled me to pick it up and boy am I glad I did. This book was without a doubt the best book I have read in a long time. It grabbed me and didn't let me go.    This book is told from a different point of view than what I have read in the past - the struggle of good ordinary people living in Nazi Germany who are helpless to the tragic events that are changing and ruining their lives. The characters in the book are simply unforgettable and what makes this book so powerful. In an interview, Zusak said that this is the first time he has ever missed his characters. I think anyone that reads this book will also miss Liesel, Rudy, Hans, Rosa, and Max.    The writing style of Zusak is quite different in that the narrator is Death. Some reviewers found it off putting but I found it to be unique and enjoyable. The author has a real way with words and figurative language. His use of imagery is powerful. In one interview he was asked about his writing style and he said, \\"I like the idea that every page in every book can have a gem on it. It's probably what I love most about writing - that words can be used in a way that's like a child playing in a sandpit, rearranging things, swapping them around.\\" His response to that question explains why I enjoyed this book so much because I think he succeeded. The amazing thing to me is this book was published when he was just 30. That is incredible to me. I look forward to reading his other books and any other books he writes in the future. He has set the bar very high for me.
0330485385|4.0|In The Lovely Bones, Susie Salmon narrates her story from heaven. In 1973, at age fourteen, she was murdered by a neighbor. Susie talks about how it happened and how her family copes with her death. Her spirit stays around her family, friends and even her murderer. She watches as her loved ones deal with her death. She also follows her murderer as he disposes of her body and continues living his life.<br /><br />I got my copy of The Lovely Bones last year for 25 cents at a library sale that I stumbled upon. Isn't that the way it always is? You find an amazing book when you least expect it. This was an emotional, heartwrenching read. I emersed myself into this book, I could not put it down. I even got teary eyed during certain parts, which is not something I tend to do while reading a book.<br /><br />The storyline was moving and the characters were really well written. I liked the relationship between Susie and her older sister Lindsey, even after death the two sisters are entwined. I also liked Susie's view of her heaven and the way she describes it. She always lingers around her loved ones, never wanting to let them go. I found Susie and her fathers relationship to be very moving. The way her father feels guilt over her death and how he really never gets over it. Some of the passages describing thier relationship were among the most emotional in the book. Especially years after her death when he finally comes to terms with her never coming back home.
0385504225|1.0|I have enjoyed most of Dan Brown's books at some level, both the Digital Fortress and the Robert Langdom ones.  THIS, however, was the biggest waste of time and money I have endured in ages.  A few of the puzzles were interesting and clever.  But the development was excruciating, the characters actions unreasonable and the payoff both predictable and incredibly anti-climactic.  If there were negative stars, this would receive them.

When asking for Archangel Michael's advice, he always cuts straight to the heart of the matter. His advice comes across in the same manner when using these cards. I've given the cards a 5 star rating but I would have rather given 4 1/2 stars simply because I do not enjoy the images on the cards as much as say the Angel Therapy deck. I'm drawn to bolder more colorful & modern images. The images on these cards are a bit 'old school'. All in all, I will be using this deck often to do readings for myself and others. It's an instant favorite.

B002QEXN2K|5.0|I love all John Mayer's albums. When i first listened to Battle Studies i was left wanting that same rocking sound that Continuum had. While listening to the new album i kept waiting for something that sounded like \\"Vultures\\" or \\"Bold as love\\". I gave Battle Studies another listen and this time i focused on the lyrics and the new sounds. I might even like this one more than Continuum. I love the way John Mayer writes songs. So much of his work i can relate to. He is such a clever guy. He can take the most simple concept and put his own little twist to it that makes you think. This guy is simply a genius. If you are a true JM fan pick this album up for sure. And also try to make it out to his up coming tour. Once you see him live you can truly appreciate him.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|Just saw Wicked in Denver, CO at the Buell Theatre.  I chose to see the show based on hearing a few of the songs at a chorus concert, I had not read the book.  Sure, the CD is not like seeing the musical - Duh!  However, this recording is wonderful.  It helps me to remember the terrific time I had at the actual musical.  I think that's the point of soundtracks.  The music takes us back to the experience - and this CD does that for me.  (I believe the performers in the traveling show I saw in Denver did just as good a job with the songs as the folks on this CD.  So, if you're waffling about whether to see the traveling show or not - Just do it, you won't be disappointed.)
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I was looking for a cheap alternative to buying a GPS unit, and having already owned some street map software, this was perfect.  i used this for a few trips and the only problems i had were the fact that my software was not up to date(some addresses were missing and i was lost for about 30 minutes).  This did everything that i had wanted it too, and paired seamlessly with just about every street map software that exists.  I would recommend this to anyone with a laptop looking for a navigational system.

0321525655|4.0|Subtitled, \\"Simple Ideas on Presentation Design and Delivery,\\" the author of this exceptional book is a writer, designer and musician who lives and works in Japan. Drawing upon zen principles throughout the book, each of the three key chapters (Preparation, Design and Delivery) is full of practical insights and examples of the primary principles for enhancing the reader's ability to make their points powerfully and concisely. Multiple topics close with an \\"In Sum\\" page that repeats the key principles of that portion of the book. Beautifully illustrated with scores of examples of both good and bad presentation slides (the book is not really about PowerPoint or Keynote, but the entire presentation process), Reynolds and his contributors provide excellent, practical insights on the entire process.<br /><br />Some key takeaways from the book include:<br />-Seek to realize the maximum effort with the minimum means.<br />-Never start your design on a computer. Presentation software is not designed for the brainstorming necessary. Consider using Post-its on a wall or a storyboard.<br />-There are three documents in a presentation - the slides you show, the notes you use and the handouts you provide after the presentation.<br />-Avoid \\"slideuments\\" - Documents that are masquerading as PowerPoint slides.<br />-Be sure your presentation answers the two main questions: 1. What is your point? 2. Why does it matter?<br />-Practice the six Main Principles in your presentation - Simplicity, Unexpectedness, Concreteness, Credibility, Emotions and Stories (the acronym is SUCCESs).<br />-Regarding design (there are scores of examples in the book), remember the Big Four: Contrast, Repetition, Alignment and Proximity.<br /><br />An incredibly useful (not to mention aesthetically striking) book for anyone who seeks to enhance their presentation skills.<br /><br />To quote Seth Godin (one of the contributors and no slacker in this area himself!), \\"Please don't buy this book! Once people start making better presentations, mine won't look so good. (But if you really want to learn what works and how to do it right, Garr is the man to learn from.)\\"look so good.

0786868724|5.0|I am writing this review through a veil of tears. My sadness is not because the wonderful rabbi in the book  dies. It is because I never got to meet him, hear his wisdom first hand and be moved by his simple life affirming,faith filled life. This book is the next best thing. Mitch Albom has eloquently told the story of what real faith is using two inspirational men, the warmhearted, song singing rabbi and the repentant sinner turned pastor Henry Covington.Though their worlds are quite far apart in every way imaginable, their cores are linked by  a common element called faith. Albom is called on  to write a eulogy at the request of the rabbi. This may seem maudlin and sad but the journey to get to know his estranged childhood rabbi, now in his eighties, is a springboard to a rebirth of spirituality for Albom. He discovers in the simple, family loving  and dedicated rabbi the key to what constitutes faith. He also realizes that the same ingredients are in Henry Covington and the discovery prompts Albom to look at religion and God in a new and inspired way. This book is a requisite for all....... Christian,Muslim Protestant or Jew. In the words of a frail and aging rabbi and the dedicated  life of the pastor we find answers that have plagued scholars for centuries, answers that enlighten , inspire and bring new beauty to what makes us all connected in one human family. Kudos to Albom on a revelational story .

1932100660|5.0|This book has immediate eye-opening impact.  I read 3 chapters the first night and the next morning I was so convinced by the research and evidence presented by Dr. Campbell that I became an instant \\"vegan\\".  Granted I was already a vegetarian but I loved eating my homemade yogurt, milk kefir, and some cheeses.  You may say you have heard it all before (e.g., a diet high in fruits, vegetables and grains is the healthiest way of eating) but Dr. Campbell displays his life time of scientific research and personal experience in such a factual manner that you cannot deny the truth of it and you cannot deny the detrimental effects that eating animal products (including eggs and especially dairy) has on your body.  Dr. Collin's son, Thomas M. Campbell, helps display this information in a wonderfully readable and convincing manner. I was eager to read it from cover to cover (and I highly recommend you do the same to get the full impact).  I originally checked the book out of the library and half way through it I knew I wanted to own it so I purchased 3 copies from Amazon so I could have loaners for friends and family.

1594488916|4.0|Allison Hoover Bartlett's The Man Who Loved Books Too Much is a quick, readable look at the world of book collection. She dips into the history of bibliomania and provides vignettes of other characters, but mostly the book is an account of two men and the author's experiences in getting to know them. Ken Sanders is the owner of a rare book store in Salt Lake City who served for six years as the security chair of the Antiquarian Booksellers' Association. He embraced that role enthusiastically, improved methods for alerting members of the organization to recent thefts during his tenure, and doggedly pursued one particular repeat offender. John Charles Gilkey, like other bibliomaniacs, is obsessed with adding to his collection of rare books, but in his case the books have tended to come free of charge, courtesy of the sorry souls who were unlucky enough to have once handed over their credit cards to Gilkey when he worked at Saks Fifth Avenue. Gilkey methodically collected their numbers and identities and used the cards, months later, to fund hotel stays and book-buying junkets.<br /><br />Bartlett spent a lot of time interviewing both men, and while neither quite comes alive on the page, Gilkey emerges as an interestingly flawed human being, possessed of a curiously selective sense of morality. For him, stealing rare books is illegal, perhaps, but hardly immoral, a means of evening the score against an unfair world that has not made him rich enough to own priceless books without stealing them. His conscience about his misdeeds is clear. Bartlett spends some time with Gilkey's mother and sister as well--more exploration of this dysfunctional family would have made for a  more interesting book. Gilkey's mother, at least, seems to be thoroughly in denial about her son, whom she praises for his outstanding posture.<br /><br />I don't really get the allure of collecting myself--books or anything else. Like the author, I understand that books can carry secondary meanings as physical objects: a book may be loved because of its place in your or someone else's history. But I don't relate to books in the same way that collectors apparently do, desiring to possess particular copies, and so I approach this story as something of an outsider. Bartlett's book is not a hard-hitting investigative piece by any means, and it probably won't offer anything new to readers familiar with book-collecting from their own experience or from other treatments of the subject. But for the non-specialist it's a good light introduction to the topic and to the lives of the two very different men whom the author profiles.<br /><br />-- Debra Hamelphysical objects: a book may be loved because of its place in your or someone else's history.

B002QEXN2K|5.0|This album is excellent. In my opinion, it is very different from Continuum, and that is a good thing. By now, if you are a Mayer fan, you already know he is a great guitar player. With BS, he's not trying to dazzle you with his fretwork. The melodies are beautiful, and the lyrics even better. This may be his best album yet. Very good all the way through. Well done.

0393316041|5.0|I read this Feynmann book many years ago, lost it and have recently purchased it again and re-read it.  I'm pleased to say that the stories in it are just as funny, fascinating and diverting as I found them the first time round, possibly more so. Readers who want to sample Feynmann's humor should check out the story \\"Uncle Sam Doesn't Need You\\", in which he gets rejected from the draft to the military on psychological grounds!  The story on his cod Italian (\\"Latin or Italian?\\") is also very amusing.  The book also gives some insight into Feynmann's scientific mind: take for example the story about how he fixed radios as a kid, the one about his time as a chemist, or the one about his time on a course in cell biology.  Feynmann was an amazingly versatile individual, who was up for practically anything.    The book has a verbatim feel to it, probably because it was transcribed by Robert Leighton from conversations with Feynmann.  Possibly because of this, the language is direct in a rather attractive American way.       For those interested in further Feynmann adventures there is a sequel[[ASIN:0393320928 What Do You Care What Other People Think?: Further Adventures of a Curious Character]].  This also contains something very serious and instructive: an annex on Feynmann's work on the enquiry into the Space Shuttle challenger accident.   A fascinating complement to these books is Alan Alda's essay on the play he put on about Feynmann, covering in particular the difficulty of capturing such a rich personality in a 90 minute play.  This can be found in [[ASIN:0812977521 Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself]]
B0000084J7|2.0|I bought this hoping for some of the excitement bottled in Talk Talk's greatest hits disc. Instead, this is a sparse, minimalist plate of acoustic jazz. Mark Hollis's shimmering voice barely makes it our of the garage on this set. Talk Talk fans' money would be better spent simply mopping up whatever 'Talk' records you don't already have.
B001OQCV24|3.0|So far being Roland Emmerich's poorest disaster movie, 2012 tries very hard to touch your heart, but will mostly just blow your eardrums and make you laugh a few times.   What makes this film fail is the fact that Roland uses the same disaster movie formula once again yet with a different destruction template... it's all been done better before, yet what this film does excel in is giving you blind, dumb and mindless entertainment.   Independence Day was good because it basically introduced the \\"disaster film\\" and had to do with an alien race which people always find interesting. The characters were deep, relatable and actual good recognizable actors. The script was inspiring, giving us a glimpse of what it would be like for all the world's cultures and countries to come together to fight for a cause (with of course the USA being on top, but that's expected). The Day After Tomorrow was good because of again, good characterization and young and vibrant actors. Sure the actual acting was at times subpar, but the quality of the script gave you a feeling of what might actually happy if such an intense storm were to strike the world. There were plenty of characters and each was given their own unique stories and backgrounds, loves, fears, etc.    These two movies succeeded because they were about the characters in the disaster, not simply the disaster itself and the character's running away from it.   In 2012, the disaster is the star of the show, and the pitifully poor casting did nothing to help the stale characterization of the movie. You have your noble protagonist, your \\"comic relief\\" protagonist (John Cusack, who JUUUUUST saves this from being a total casting disaster), your selfish bureaucratic fat guy, yous kids (who of course survive), your female love interests who do nothing but stand there being pretty-faced love interests, and your government extras. There simply weren't enough main characters in this movie, and the ones who are there aren't given enough screen time for any of them to be known or cared for. There really isn't any \\"society\\" character either (as in, barely any news broadcast scenes, scenes of flocks of people trying to avoid disaster, etc), so one doesn't really feel like the disaster is REALLY affecting the entire world.   Sure the special effects are fantastic and thrilling, but how long do those last? 2, 3 minutes? This is a 2 and 1/2 hour movie, and I mostly forget what all of it was filled with.   Emmerich has been doing this so long that I guess he figures doing it half-baked will go unnoticed and the movie will still rake in millions, which it probably will considering the quality of the special effects. But if you're looking for a quality character-based film you'll remember, don't count on it with 2012.
B0025X4P56|4.0|If you're a fan of E then you'll enjoy this album.  Definitly not his best as far as radio songs, though.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|Excellently done mini-series.  If you typically love BBC mini-series productions by Andrew Davies, this will not disappoint.  From the smallest detail in costume and set to the fine acting by all in the production, this was great.  I would recommend to anyone who enjoys Charles Dickens, or Masterpiece Theater or anyone who knows a good story!
B001W79MBI|5.0|It's rare that any piece of Japanese animation has an additional language, and this is the first that I've seen where the additional language was Chinese.  Apart from the beautiful animation, epic fight scenes, and fantastic voice acting, the narrative is wonderful.  It helps to know that the Chinese characters are all Daoist, and that their actions are motivated by their meaning system.  The interaction in between the two main characters is wonderful, and the constant banter between them is a highlight of the film.    Overall, one of the best animated films in my collection.
B00006GFAB|5.0|Yes, it is missing a bunch of tracks, and it isn't exactly the very best of KISS.  However, it's a great album for someone who has never heard KISS before.  It primarily focuses on the pre-solo album years, and then they use an Ace Frehley track, which is followed by a quick synopsis of KISS afterwards.  It goes in chronological order, which is the most logical way to go when doing a compilation album.  This album is missing a few classics, but again, the important ones are there.  Also, it goes past Dynasty.  \\"I Love it Loud,\\" \\"Lick it Up,\\" \\"Forever,\\" and \\"God Gave Rock and Roll To You II\\" are definitely the best choices for post Dynasty tracks, and \\"I Was Made For Lovin' You\\" is the best choice to use if you're going to use just one track from Dynasty.  I've only heard Ace Frehley's solo album of the four, but from what most people have said, his was by far the best.  I feel that putting one of the solo album tracks is great in splitting the album into when the original line-up played, and when they had changed members around (even original members were credited).  They also rejected the few tracks where they used other musicians instead of original members (I think \\"Flaming Youth\\" is the only time when that happened back then), not counting \\"Beth\\" obviously.<br /><br />This is definitely my number one recommendation for a KISS compilation to get, if you get one, but the only other KISS compilation that I've heard is Greatest KISS.  Most people would say Double Platinum or Gold, but from what I understand, Double Platinum uses an alternate version of \\"Strutter,\\" changes the end of \\"Black Diamond,\\" and uses the \\"Rock Bottom\\" introduction for \\"She,\\" and Gold is a two-disc album that ends before Creatures of the Night, so this is probably the best single disc album to get if you want a single-disc KISS compilation.

0618680004|5.0|It's been several months since I read \\"The God Delusion\\" so it's difficult to comment on specific details of the book. For good or bad, I'm going more on my emotional reaction at this point. I'd like to begin by saying that I loved it and had a hard time putting the book down. I found myself agreeing with Dawkins' arguements time after time,(i.e., I am a Darwinist). I found myself getting quite angry at the narrow-minded fundamentalists (e.g., biblical creationists and intelligent design proponents)who delude themselves by believing half-baked pseudo science and then want the fallacious dribble taught as real science to our high school aged kids. I got even more angry as Dawkins offered his littany of human suffering caused directly or indirectly from virulent religious doctrines and the resulting emotional over reaction by zealous believers. Why don't these people see that what they believe is almost totally devoid of objective rational and empirical support? (I say \\"almost\\" because occasionally even a blind pig finds an acorn.) Dawkins is quite right IMHO that one's beliefs should be based on some measure of evidence rather than on faith alone. But why does he gain few if any converts to his cause? Herein lies the rub for me.    Because of my profession as a psychotherapist I know a bit about how people think and why they believe what they believe. This apparent problem of people blindly believing what the rest of us, the more reasonable and rational of us no less, consider misguided or worse is really complicated. As Thomas Kuhn the historian of science put it years ago, \\"All theories are value laden.\\" In other words, our beliefs (personal theories about how the world works)are derived in part by our underlying, often largely unconscious, deeper belief system. And we tend to assume that these underlying beliefs are true and therefore seldom challenge them. So what one person (me) considers to be obviously fallacious pseudo science, another considers to be equallyobviously true science.     Thomas Kuhn put forth this idea in his book \\"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\\" and used it to explain why, for example, the leading western scientific minds of the middle ages firmly believed that the earth was at the center of the solar system. Their observations led to this conclusion quite nicely. But, we today cannot imagine how they could have been so deceived. The problem, as discussed by Kuhn, is that we operate under a different paradigm than they and therefore we cannot interpret the data the way they did. That paradigm is equivilant to the differing underlying belief systems that we have as individuals.     What Dawkins and others who write similar books hope for is what Kuhn calls a \\"paradigm shift\\" to occur in the mind of the reader. The reader becomes convinced by the author that the reader's view is wrong and the author's is correct. This is unlikely to say the least because the reader's very deeply held beliefs will not permit them to see the \\"data\\" the way Dawkins wants them to see it. Almost universally a non believer will see Dawkins' arguements as unsound if not \\"deluded\\" just as Dawkins sees their points of view to be crazy.     Unfortunitely, for those of us who like to see ourselves as more rational than the other guy, we carry the same kind of deep subjective biases as the other guy. Our beliefs are just as \\"value laden\\" as his or hers and may not be held for rational reasons at all. This ultimately leaves little objective ground on which to stand. And it may be that, a hundred years from now, 22nd century scholars will look back at our science and wonder how we could be so blind.    So, in conclusion, read \\"The God Delusion\\" because you already love it or because you already hate it. There is almost no chance that you will change horses in midstream, no matter how good the arguement might be to a believer or bad it might be to a non believer.    Post Script:  I read several other reviews of this book afterwriting this one. I have to agree with several other reviewers, Dawkins comes across as a very angry person in this book. This tone is unfortunite and unnecessary. Prof. Dawkins is an intellectual and academic of the first order and his expertise in his field is unquestioned by his peers. One reviewer commented that he comes across as a \\"fundamentalist athiest\\" and I must admit that I agree with that characterization. His anger seems to take him to a level of intolerance of religion and people of faith that I found personally troubling. Intolerance is one of the hardest things for me to tolerate.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Okay, first I would be remiss if I didn't say: Is Charlie Hunnam fine or what? He absolutely drives this show for me. I want to tune in and see what's up with Jacks and all that sex appeal he's giving off! Jacks is a man's man, who loves fiercly, protects his women, and treasures his dead father's memory. He walks with confidence and is not afraid to say what he thinks, stand up for what he believes in, bring the fight to those who wrong him or those he loves, or even die for the cause. But, he tries to do it smartly, not letting his emotions always control the plan to keep the club alive and steer it into more legitimate business ventures. He's also not afraid to let us see his intimate side that portrays him as a caring and often tender character. One word: Swag! Almost makes me want to go out and find a biker boy to play with!    But, on the serious tip, this show has got EVERYthing! Love, betrayal, fear, bravado, fights, murders, drug deals, blackmail, bribery, revenge, secrets, prison, porn, corrupt police, corrupt politicians, gun running, rich people, gangs, and a healthy dose of the feebies showing up to make things difficult... with all its twists, turns, and surprises, you name it and you'll find it all here! Absolutely one of the best shows I've seen in a long time!     Don't know what took me so long to tune in, but I'm so glad I did. Too bad this first season was so short, but the second season is shaping up just fine. Can't wait to own that one too!    Think the whole \\"motorcycle\\" club thing is not your scene? You'd be surpised by this show as it relates to just about everyone across the color lines.

Not as bluesy/soulful as \\"Continuum\\" but still shows off his chops as a guitar player. I would say he constructed this album with Tom Petty, Fleetwood Mac, and Neil Young in mind.

0385737947|5.0|To be honest, I bought the book for a long plane ride. I thought the cover looked interesting but not very inviting.  I was hooked right away. I had just heard a survivor of a WWII German concentration camp speak a couple of hours before I read this book. In her talk, she mentioned that life in the camps didn't seem to make any sense and that the Germans were barbarians who would do anything and who carried out terrible experiments on humans. The more I read, the more I envisioned this woman as a teenager being lowered into the Glade. I thought of this  woman who survived HELL as a teen their age and came to believe these fictional teens could also meet the challenge of the Glade and the Maze....as long as they had hope. The sense of hope was an important part of the book, especially when kids started getting killed.  I had a number of questions that really didn't get answered but then I found out that this  book is part of a trilogy....that isn't mentioned on the cover. I immediately thought of Sleator's House of Stairs and Running Out of Time by Haddix. Good book. I've already recommended it to 2 eighth graders.

0800177975|4.0|Despite a rapid decline in the weekly soundboard routine Sid remains very loyal to the king of pranks himself, Arnold Schwarzenegger. For years we have been blessed with so many laughs and enjoyment from our bulky headed California governor that we felt the need to get another one of his films in. At this point the pickings are very slim since we pounded away at the Arnold market for a year straight in 07. However we were reminded that Last Action Hero still lies in wait and luckily our friend on-demand just happened to have it available.<br /><br />Our film starts off with young Arnold movie obsessed Danny Madigan as he hangs around at his local movie theater. He's a regular and has befriended the boss from Mrs. Doubtfire who moonlights as the theater owner, who invites Danny to a secret midnight screening of the new Jack Slater movie. Sounds a bit to catch a predator sketchy but the old man checks out and was not just \\"some old guy wanting to perv you out.\\" Somehow the ticket Danny receives is magic and transports him into the back of Arnold caddie. From there he tags along everywhere in a world where the movies are a reality.<br /><br />For us the film was worth of four star rating off the two simple facts that Eclipse is the first face you see on screen and Apache from the immortal [[ASIN:B00069QD74 Death Ring]] makes an appearance. Yeah that's right Apache, awesome. That also lead us to believe Arnold is a big fan of Apache's work since he also had him play the exact same driver role in Predator. Yeah you have no idea what we're talking about but you'll just have to say \\"well I'm not used to that but that's fine.\\" Unfortunately Sid was on the cusp of quite a nerve racking situation thanks to the real life 40 year old virgin and couldn't enjoy Last Action Hero quite as much as we wanted. Despite that the movie was a laugh riot filled with soundboard lines and goofy dialogue. It's one worth checking out for the Arnold enthusiasts out there.
B0017HMF6W|5.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2009 50th Anniversary \\"BLU RAY\\" VERSION ***<br /><br />As you watch the title credits of Hitch's 1959 masterpiece \\"North By Northwest\\" roll up on screen in all their resplendent VistaVision Technicolor - the shiny, cold and aloof glass panelling of a New York skyscraper act as their backdrop.<br /><br />It's a brilliant touch, because combined with Bernard Herrmann's staccato score it ratchets up the tension and also subliminally suggests to the viewer that some poor John Doe is about to get rightly and royally screwed by big business and big Government - or both. And of course, mistaken for a UN diplomat called George Caplin - our hapless hero George Thornhill (played by Cary Grant) - does just that.<br /><br />Then when the credits end and Cary exits the lift with his secretary (Doreen Lang), all suited-n-booted and looking dapper enough to lick - another element kicks in - the picture quality...<br /><br />The print is just BEAUTIFUL - featuring as it does state-of-the art frame-by-frame restoration. In fact, I raved in an Amazon UK Listmania list some 3 years ago about how good the DVD looked - well this BLU RAY is better - and at times just jaw dropping to look at.<br /><br />Icing on the cake is that this 50th Anniversary BLU RAY reissue also adds on some superlative new features which are just as good as the film itself (nearly 3 hours of viewable features).<br /><br />Here's the full list:<br /><br />1. Commentary by Ernest Lehman (Original Script-Writer)<br />2. New 2009 Documentary \\"The Master's Touch: Hitchcock's Signature Style\\" (over 50 minutes - featuring comments from directors Martin Scorsese, Curtis Hanson, Francis Lawrence, Guillermo del Toro and many more)<br />3. Previously seen, but superlative feature-length profile \\"Cary Grant: A Class Apart\\" (over 1 1/2 hours)<br />4. New 2009 feature called \\"North By Northwest: One For The Ages\\" examining the movies innovations and influences<br />5. Feature called \\"The Making Of North By Northwest\\" from 2000 hosted by Eva Marie Saint<br />6. Music Only Audio Track<br />7. Stills Gallery  (black & white stills of the stars and Hitchcock - both on set and on location)<br />8. Theatrical Trailers & TV Spots<br />9. Internet link to Warner Brothers<br /><br />A whole bunch of things combine to make NBN work - a great story by Ernest Lehman, superb night and day locations, immaculate period clothes, the bulbous gas-guzzling cars, the art-deco buildings, the interiors of wealthy homes and the deeply luxurious dining cars of long-distance 1950's trains. And to top all of that, you get genuine old-school Hollywood star power in the form of James Mason, Martin Landau, Leo Carroll and the luminous love interest Eva Marie Saint. And of course the effortlessly suave and charming Cary Grant - arguably the best leading man Tinseltown ever produced. Throw in the tension, wit and camera angles of Hitchcock at the helm - and you're on a winner.<br /><br />But your eyes keep coming back to how this BLU RAY shines. There are so many little scenes that now look sumptuous - Alfred missing the bus just at the end of the opening credits in his famous cameo scene - the garish colors of Fifties New York taxis, the marble of the Plaza hotel lobby as Cary walks through to meet clients in in the bar. Then there's the Townsend home and gardens as the villains motor up the gravel driveway to the front door, the three dapper suits of the boys as they parry in the library room inside (Mason, Landau and Grant) and the clarity of the night scene where they put a drunk Cary in a stolen car and try to drive him off a cliff. Further on there's the color of the fields in the legendary crop-duster scene, hanging off the Mount Rushmore monument by your fingernails - even Eva Saint Marie's beautiful red dress in the hotel room as she stands by the door while Cary showers in the bathroom... I could go on!<br /><br />If I was to point out one genuine downside, it's the focus. Some scenes quite deliberately have Grant and Saint with an almost halo-like shine around them (soft focus to make them look better) and can at times make the print look just a teeny bit soft, but other than that the whole shebang is a joy to behold...<br /><br />Up there with \\"The Italian Job\\", \\"Zulu\\",  \\"Goldfinger\\", \\"Saturday Night, Sunday Morning\\", \\"2001\\" A Space Odyssey\\" and \\"The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\\" in terms of top quality restoration (see my reviews for each) - \\"North By Northwest\\" is a triumph on BLU RAY. And the superb additional extras only make you feel that Warners are to be praised for a job well done...<br /><br />Roll on \\"To Catch A Thief\\" on the BLU RAY format - another beautiful Hitchcock/Grant restoration currently being raved about (the \\"Centennial Collection\\" double DVD set)...ake them look better) and can at times make the print look just a teeny bit soft, but other than that the whole shebang is a joy to behold...    Up there with \\"The Italian Job\\", \\"Zulu\\",  \\"Goldfinger\\", \\"Saturday Night, Sunday Morning\\", \\"2001\\" A Space Odyssey\\" and \\"The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\\" in terms of top quality restoration (see my reviews for each) - \\"North By Northwest\\" is a triumph on BLU RAY.

B0017HMF6W|5.0|My favorite blu-rays are the classics. This one is very high on my list. Looks great. Buy it. We need to encourage the release of the rest of Sir Alfred's work on blu-ray. The only down-side is the fact that some of the supplements are not in high def.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|We missed this show when it was released.  We had heard that it was a fabulous and very accurate portrayal of the events surrounding our founding as a nation.  Our family LOVED it and highly recommend it for family viewing.  There is one \\"love scene\\" between John and Abigail that wouldn't be appropriate for younger children and a couple of surgeries that were graphically portrayed so keep your remote handy to fast forward.      The production values are magnificent, the character development is excellent and overall it made us want to buy the book and read it as well.

0385504225|3.0|Predictable, cliché-characters (even going as far cut-and-pasting Silas with minor tweaking), amateurish mentions of technologies(twitter-this, iPhone that, google this etc.) with even less understanding of computers than CSI (though I shouldn't have been expecting more from the writer of \\"Digital Fortress\\"). I understand this novel is for the masses, but there is no reason to dumb it down that much, if people bother to read a book they are not THAT dumb. I really felt more like I was reading a screenplay than a novel in places, even going as far as telling us what song is playing in the background in a very unnatural way, almost breaking the flow of the narration. And seriously, the Bible? Trying to get in bed with the Catholic Church, after antagonizing them with \\"Angels and Demons\\" and \\"The Da Vinci Code\\"?  Still enjoyable, some intrigue even if you can see what's coming a mile away and nice descriptions without becoming too wordy. Still, the overall feeling is that the author had the making of a movie in mind the whole time, and not the writing of a novel.

B001Q8FRMQ|5.0|This 2009 release from Light in the Attic records is the way to go, but be informed that despite amazon's claim, there are no extra tracks on this release, just the 7 original ones, clocking in at a little under half an hour.

B002QH2NUA|5.0|Somehow at age 67 the iconic and tireless Paul McCartney can still perform long concerts with his incredible voice intact and his energy level remaining frenetic.  It's the rockers on this CD that are utterly captivating. The version of \\"Day Tripper\\" is scorching. The intense \\"I've Got A Feeling\\" sounds timeless. \\"Helter Skelter\\" is sheer psychedelia. \\"I'm Down\\" is still a seminal Beatles' classic. \\"Only Mama Knows\\" is a riveting gem from \\"Memory Almost Full.\\"  The cosmic \\"Highway\\" and \\"Sing The Changes\\" are two of the greatest songs from MACCA'S last Fireman CD, the brilliant \\"Electric Arguments\\". \\"Mrs. Vanderbilt\\" is a welcome live song from Paul's vintage Wings era.    There are also many high quality songs that MACCA has been performing live for years. \\"Jet\\" and \\"Live And Let Die\\" are sterling and explosive. \\"Get Back\\", \\"Lady Madonna\\" and \\"Back In The USSR\\" are great audience pleasers because they fervently rock. A major highlight is Paul performing John and his own vocals on the poignant \\"A Day In The Life.\\" The fantastic concert aptly closes with \\"Sgt. Peppers\\" and \\"The End.\\"    This CD proves that Paul McCartney is one of the paramount live concert performers in musical history. His vocals and instrumental virtuosity are amazing. MACCA resonates live and on stage.    Note: It's imperative for all McCartney fans to have The Fireman \\"Electric Arguments\\" CD. It's arguably his finest CD and it's probably the one that Lennon would appreciate the most.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|John Mayer is known for a certain sound, and it was always predicted on what his albums would sound like.  Battle Studies breaks the mold and is quite experimental.  This record is one of a kind and is the most somber piece of work that he has put out. While listening to this record, it's pretty hard to focus on anything except the music.  It pulls you into John's world and makes you feel every emotion that he feels. It's a indescribable feeling. Although this album has a different vibe then what you would be used to,  Mayer still doesn't lose his ingenuity.    Direct Link:[...]

B002QH2NUA|3.0|How many live albums does Sir Paul intend to put out? Considering that he's past retirement age, he can't have that many left in him, and he certainly doesn't need the money, being one of the wealthiest men in the world. But he's an energetic 67 and clearly enjoys performing: his voice is remarkably strong, the band is tight, and the crowd is enthusiastic.<br /><br />It's a good show, and if I could, I'd give it 3-1/2 stars. While it suits my 50-something tastes (4 stars), there are slow and/or weak spots scattered throughout (3 stars) and the whole production finally strikes me as pointless. If you were there, though, or wish that you could have been, it's well-recorded and well-filmed and serves as a fine souvenir.<br /><br />Citi Field in New York brings back memories of the Fab Four at Shea Stadium, which used to occupy the same grounds, but that was another time and place, and it was long ago (1965) if not so far away. What does Paul bring to 2009? For the most part, this is a trip down nostalgia lane for baby boomers who will never get enough. The show starts out with a rollicking \\"Drive My Car\\" and a roaring \\"Jet,\\" then scatters Beatles songs (\\"Got to Get You into My Life,\\" \\"The Long and Winding Road,\\" \\"Blackbird,\\" \\"Eleanor Rigby\\") through a first half that's mostly Wings and solo output. A few of these are tepid rehashes of lesser songs (\\"Here Today,\\" \\"Dance Tonight,\\" \\"Calico Skies\\"), but others hit the mark, particularly \\"Only Mama Knows\\" and \\"Let Me Roll It.\\" A new song celebrating New York, \\"Sing the Changes,\\" isn't bad, but that's the most I can say for it.<br /><br />The latter half of the show, beginning with \\"Back in the USSR\\" and winding up with a medley of \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" and \\"The End,\\" is virtually all Lennon and McCartney songs. Out of the 33 tracks on DVD and CD, 20 are Beatles hits. Most of them are rockers (\\"I'm Down,\\" \\"I've Got a Feeling,\\" \\"Paperback Writer,\\" \\"Day Tripper,\\" \\"Helter Skelter,\\" \\"Get Back\\") to get the crowd on their feet and demonstrate that Paul still has chops, and these are high points of the show. \\"Something\\" gets both a folksy mandolin treatment and an orchestral version that will surely remind you of the original. \\"Let It Be\\" is similarly faithful, while \\"Lady Madonna\\" is more of a rave-up than the Beatles made it.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are less successful efforts: \\"A Day in the Life\\" devolves into a \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" sing-along, and \\"Hey Jude\\" becomes a ladies-and-gentlemen sing-along. Unfortunately, these just slow down the proceedings. And an encore duet with Billy Joel on \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" will certainly not supplant the Beatles classic. Paul being as old as he is, the obligatory \\"Yesterday\\" bears a certain poignancy, but do we really need to hear him sing it one... more... time...?<br /><br />If you don't have one of Paul's numerous live shows on CD or DVD, or if you're young and need proof that age is just a number, this bargain-priced set will do. But for the most part it's simply unnecessary.

0061689246|4.0|I plowed through this book in the course of one lazy Sunday afternoon.  This is both a plus and a minus in my mind.  I truly enjoy the worlds that Gaiman creates and, with this the third book of his I've read, can consider myself a fan.  Stardust doesn't fail in that regard as I was happily drawn in to the sometimes silly, sometimes scary, world which our hero must inhabit in order to retrieve a fallen star for his true love.<br />Simply put, the biggest problem I had with this book was that I wanted more.  I wanted deeper character stories and more history and a longer plot. I felt like I was only allowed to dip my toes into a cool stream when, after some initial toe dipping, what I really wanted to do was strip naked, dive in, and swim and swim and swim in said cool stream.  But all you get is the toe dip, and that is to be regretted and enjoyed at the same time.
B00127RAJY|5.0|My friend invited me over to her house to try out this workout DVD.  Let's just say after I tried it at her house I couldn't get home to order my own fast enough!      Pros: The 30 Day Shred allows you to work out by yourself or with a group. It's great for anyone, no matter your fitness level. In the video she has 2 other women doing 2 different intensities of the same moves.  I LOVE THIS! It encourages people who aren't fitness buffs to stay engaged and to keep trying.  My friend and I have been doing this video for several months now, 5 days a week.  We can definitely tell a difference in ourselves.  We love the variety and now switch between the levels.   It's a great 30 minute workout that pushes you, but doesn't leave you sore the next day.     Cons:  To be fair I should mention the Cons.   You may be annoyed by the intro, but it's relatively short.  You can't fast forward through it and you do have to watch it every time you start the DVD.  The only other con I can think of is that the DVD doesn't really tell you when to move to the next level.  We just did a level for a couple weeks and then moved onto the next level.      Overall, this DVD is great now matter what level of fitness you are at.  It's easy to follow; it has variety, and intensity.  I recommend it to all my friends and to you.

B002NWRMVS|4.0|I first heard this album when Norah Jones was being interviewed about it on NPR.  I love the new sound she's created and I like that it is totally different than her previous albums.  One of my favorites is \\"Man of the Hour\\" which according to Jones is actually about wanting a dog, not a man.  All in all, great album, great sound, and as always her voice sounds awesome.  With all the horrible, cliche stuff on the radio it's so refreshing to hear something different, something not cookie cutter, so for me this album is great!

B00003CXBH|5.0|The Mission: 9 out of 10: Films about faith often fail. They tend to be preachy dry affairs starring Kirk Cameron as a man who is addicted to online porn, until he finds God and smashes the evil computer with a baseball bat because apparently he has joined the Taliban or something. Most Christain films are designed simply reinforce the prejudices of a limited choir.     Critically acclaimed serious films are also often fairly dry affairs, interested more in being good  rather than being entertaining. They tend to beat a visual and narrative dead horse rather than entertain for the sake of entertaining.    The Mission is a critically acclaimed movie about faith... and I loved it.    I had avoided the film for twenty years as if it was an A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius. It turns out to be a dynamic, action packed affair, starring Robert De Niro, Jeremy Irons and a very young Liam Neelson.     It is a movie about faith. In fact, it is one of the most moving and effect movies about the purpose of faith and redemption I have ever seen. It is also about the historical pact between Spain and Portugal (Treaty of Madrid) and the war on both the natives of the jungle and the powerful Jesuits who protect them.     The movie is told in flashback with a Papal emissary (the excellent Ray McAnally) telling the tale and his tragic role in shaping it. The visuals are often simply amazing and the score by Ennio Morricone is considered one of the best of all time. Some critics felt the war scenes at the end muddled but I feel this reflects on the nature of battle and at the very least, this viewer had no trouble following it.    One side note the film contains a lot of nudity including some rather shocking child nudity. Since the film is rated PG, one must assume the ratings board used the National Geographic rules in their assessment.     There I go praising the film no doubt scaring off viewers that are afraid it will be good. It is, but it is also entertainingwith great action, visuals and top notch actors.

B00000AF95|5.0|I really enjoy these last few albums by KISS. Dare I say it, but, I think that they are just as good, in their own 80's Glam-Rock style, as the material KISS released in the 70's.<br /><br />On this outing, once again the lead gutarist has been changed with the mighty Vinnie Vincent gone, and a new lead guitarist, the great Mark St. John in.<br /><br />Eric Carr continues as the excellent drummer, and of course along with original founders Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley, they all make the magic happen.<br /><br />Standout tracks are, Heaven's On Fire, Burn Bitch Burn, Get All You Can Take, Under The Gun, and Murder In High Heels.
B002MU4NL8|5.0|I didn't expect too much when I first saw this movie, but I was really surprised as to how much fun it was.  Most movies I get I only watch once, but this is one I keep watching because it's a great parody of the original Star Trek, which I loved, and has very interesting characters and is also a real hoot!  One of the most underated flicks of all time.  VERY worth it.
B00000AF98|4.0|While it's not one of my more favorite releases from KISS in the 80's, it's still not bad. It's much more Pop-oriented than the last few KISS entries before it, much more similiar in the vein of their Unmasked album, but this one is much better, in my opinion.<br /><br />Bruce Kulick returns again as lead gutarist and does some mighty fine guitar licks and riffs on here, especially on the Van Halen-sounding No, No, No guitar solo opening.<br /><br />Eric Carr continues as the band's drummer and performs quite well throughout. Paul Stanley really shines on this release though and holds much of the album up by contributing the majority of the vocals. Gene Simmons songs are good too.<br /><br />All in all, it's not a bad album, but, it definitely could have used a little more of an edge to it all in order to make it truly great.<br /><br />Standout tracks are Crazy Nights, No, No, No, When Your Walls Come Down, Reason To Live, and Girl Gone Bad.
B000PY52EU|4.0|BLACK SNAKE MOAN    I remember when this film first came out all I heard about was some big controversy about a black man chaining up a naked white woman. My first thought was who cares I have seen more offensive things on cartoons, I mean come on. So the time went by and I never had the desire to watch this movie, at first. Eventually my brother brought this by and said he had been wanting to see it forever, not because of the stuff sounding the film but because of the great Sam Jackson. I agreed and said if he was in it then it probably would be good, plus I liked the writer/director's last film before this one. So I gave in and sat down to watch the movie and while I never felt offended ever threw out this I was surprised because I had no idea Justin Timberlake was in this.    Rae [Ricci] is a disturbed girl who seems to not be able to overcome a past traumatic event involving sexual abuse and rape. In fact it is so bad that when she goes into her attacks she resorts to the only thing she learned as a little girl, sex with men. So after her man leaves for the military named Ronnie [Timberlake] she immediately goes into these attacks caused by his absence. She goes on to have sex with any and every man that she can when that feeling hits. That all starts to change one night after she is beaten and left for dead by Ronnie's brother later to be found on the road by Lazarus [Jackson].    Lazarus has some problems of his own seeing that his wife has left him for his brother and his blues career is long gone. He is having enough trouble with out Rae when he stumbles upon her, he takes her in and starts to care for her. While in his care she comes in and out of conciseness every time in the middle of one of her episodes. Each time she throws are self at him and continues to do so when she comes out of it, I guess to thank him. It is at this point he sees what is going on and decides to cure her of her sickness, hence the now famous her tied up with a chain scenes. The movie plays out in what really was not all that controversial and actually kinda makes sense in a weird way. Ronnie is coming home and he has problems himself as we learn and Lazarus has a few friends that become involved.    After watching this movie I did not see what the big deal was and can only believe it is because of the way the film was marketed. If the roles were reversed and an old white man had a young sex craved black woman tied up I still don't see any problem as long as the story was the same, but I am sure that would have been just as controversial. I think writer/director Craig Brewer did a good job with this film and took a whole different way than what I was lead to believe this film was. The film was actually a good piece of entertainment which is what films are all about, mostly. The film did have problems like most but over all I enjoyed it, a cool film about very different people helping each other find themselves. Also the shots in this film are excellent with the opening credits as a great example as is the blues music choosen for this, great stuff.    As for performances Samuel L. Jackson as always was good and played the ex blues singer Lazarus well, he seems real dark at times but over the course of his time spent with Rae he becomes who he once was. Christina Ricci just may be the MVP of this production with a wonderfully sick performance. Sick as in the characters problems not a twisted horror movie kinda way, and she even gets topless and has some sex scenes. She goes from a sex crazed victim [love the scene with her mother] to a young woman learning how to deal with her problems. Still I was very surprised at the time I saw this with the performance of singer/actor Justin Timberlake. I have seen him in other things since [each time he has been great] but this was really the first time I can remember seeing him in a role like this. Timberlake impressed me with his performance here and the way he played the character when he returned homeonly to learn of his wife's affairs is great, turns out he has anxiety problems so he is messed up to. The last scene with Ricci and Timberlake is probably my favorite and he really shines in that scene. John Cothran as well is excellent in this as the preacher friend of Lazarus, Michael Raymond-James is great in this as well.    This is not the best movie ever and some may say it is not the best follow up to his Academy award winning \\"Hustle & Flow\\" but I liked it. Sure this film could have used some work but I think most fault lies within the studios marketing of the film. Even the people involved with this film Ricci in particular did not like how it was marketed. If handled correctly and shown for what kind of film it truly is the film would have probably faired better. But hey who am I to say that, I am just a guy behind a keyboard, what do I know?

0143038583|4.0|When the author is explaining the food chain, he's well-informed, specific, and highly entertaining.  Every now and then, he lapses into deeply silly philosophical mode, particularly when he's trying to grapple with the reality of killing animals for food (whether by hunting or in the slaughterhouse), something his pampered urban upbringing has made it nearly impossible for him to do.  So I could have used an editor's services in cutting out about 90% of his repetitive agonizing over whether he can actually bring himself to eat a chicken he helped slaughter or a pig he shot in the woods.  But, boy, when he finally gets out of that rut and goes back to describing the intricacies of the food chain, is he ever wonderful.  The first section, about the prevalence of corn in the industrial food chain, is an eye-opener.  Another section, about Joel Salatin's fascinating experiment in sustainable agriculture in the Shenandoah Valley, is worth the whole book.  Even the hunting-and-gathering section, which suffers most from his tendency to maunder, is stuffed full of goodies about things like mushroom cycles of life.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|I can see people's point about this album not being as bluesy or soulful as Continuum but why does it have to be? I actually prefer the bluesy/soulful John Mayer but come on this is a GREAT album from start to finish!! I really can say that I don't skip over any of the songs! This is just another side of John Mayer and it's great that he's not just a one trick pony! I do agree with a previous review that there isn't a song on here to compete with \\"Stop This Train\\" or Heart Of Life\\" but as a whole this could be his best album yet! His previous three albums had amazing songs, pretty good songs and songs I could care less for but in my opinion this album has nothing but really good songs!! So with not having one bad song it surpasses the other three as a whole! Man if it had a song like \\"Stop This Train\\" there wouldn't be an argument on what album is his best. I've already listened to this album all the way through three times and it's only 1:24 pm on the release day hahaha!!

031604461X|2.0|Okay so I have to add my 2 cents . . .     I'm a 31 year old woman and I loved the first three books.  The story of Edward and Bella's blossoming love in Twilight was wonderful and sucked me right in despite a few flaws in the book.  The heartbreak of New Moon was real and absolutely in character for our stubborn Edward and over dramatic Bella.  The emotional war in Eclipse was understated but fascinating.  And then, I was hugely disappointed with Breaking Dawn.      I will try here to put my finger on why.   SPOILERS TO FOLLOW.    The actual plot of the book and what happens doesn't bother me as much as how the author explains it to us.  I think that I could have dealt with the pointless honeymoon, the horrible birth, the weird baby, Bella's easy transition into vampire life, and the anti-climactic confrontation with the Volturi, if the book had continued to explore Edward and Bella (and even Jacob) in a meaningful way.  As other reviewers have mentioned, it seems like this book was written with the plot driving the characters rather than the characters driving the plot, as with the other books.    So here's what I didn't like:    Bella's embarrassment over her new car was cute but her hatred of the wedding was getting old.  I do understand the fear of attention and her outwardly harsh statements about all the fuss, but internally, between the reader and Bella, there should have been more complex feelings about why she is doing this and feeling this way.  A glimmer of understanding that she is being a bit silly even though she cannot overcome her fear and act according to the social norm.  But she just whines with seemingly no concern for what it does to Edward.    The wedding itself was fine, I'm not bothered by her lack of description.  I was prepared to deal with her mediocre writing skills and fill in with my imagination because, usually, her characters make up for it.  Jacobs showing up was interesting and a dramatic foreshadowing to the drama ends up happening with the sex and baby.    The honeymoon night was terribly disappointing and not because she did not give us a sex scene.  We didn't need to \\"see\\" the sex (the painful details) but this moment between them should have been a reflection of all of the yearning and torture that they had suffered.  It should have been a kind of culmination of everything that they'd been through, but instead it was insulting.  Bella doesn't even remember what happened.  She just knows that her body liked it and that she felt no pain.  It sounds like she blocked it out of her memory because it was frightening.  The author should have given us a poignant summary through Bella's thoughts without describing the act because HOW they made love for the first time is important.  Did Edward start out tender and then lose control slowly?  Did he just snap and throw her on the bed to ravish her with barely restrained violence?  And here's a crazy thought (I know we women like to be taken but. . .) why not have Bella take charge while Edward concentrates on staying in control?  It seems like an awful lot to ask of him to let go and remain in command of himself at the same time.  But no, we get nothing but more of Edward's self-loathing and Bella's irritation that he can't just get over it.  Bella doesn't even try to understand how hard it must have been for him.  But then again, she wasn't even paying attention apparently.    Bella getting pregnant did not bother me.  I have no problem with the liberties that the author took with vampire lore.   All a vampire needs is some way to transfer his essence to the woman so that her body can do the rest.  Strict biology aside, this is not hard to imagine this in the world of fantasy.  What did bother me was the needless torture heaped upon Edward again.  How much does this boy have to suffer anyway?  He already hates himself for bruising Bella during sex even though a little rough sex hardly makes him a monster, but then he has to deal with this horrifying baby killing the woman he just married.  Is it any wonder he went crazy in this book?      And here we come to another problem.  While I enjoyed hearing Jacob's voice, I think that the perspective hurt the characters of Bella and Edward.  I get that Edward did not show his frenzied state to Bella so only Jake could tell us about that but Jake doesn't spend an awful lot of time dwelling on what Ed's going through like Bella would have, so we lose Ed in this section.  Jake tries to tell us that Ed is absolutely insane at this point, which is why Ed suggests offering Jake as a stud, but the depth of his despair is lost on many readers and they think Ed's request is out of character.   I think that readers were expected (rightly or wrongly) to really get into Ed's head by themselves in order to understand his perspective.  Relying solely on Jake's words and thoughts is a mistake but one which author left open for readers to make.    Also, because of Jake's perspective, Bella comes off as crazy.  She coldly disregards everyone's advice because she's suddenly obsessed with protecting the child.  If we had been in Bella's head, perhaps we would have understood her motivations better, but instead she becomes an uncharacteristically brainless b**ch.    The birth was horrifying and the transformation was completely unromantic.  Yes, shattering our idealistic notion of how Edward would change Bella was unforgivable.  I wouldn't have minded her bloody body and the syringe to the heart so much if we had been able to follow Edward around with a bit more tenderness as he bit her again and again, desperately injecting more and more of his venom.  Again Jake's perspective ruined the moment.    Okay, yes, the baby's name is stupid but what gets me is that the child is creepy.  She just takes over.  Everyone obeys her and no one thinks that is strange.  Nessie scares the crap out of me and that ruins the whole effect of the baby.  Besides, neither Bella nor Edward really respond tothe child that well.  They'd much rather be in the bedroom so the child is actually more of an inconvenient distraction until she gets her claws on you and you become mush in her little evil hands [shudder].    Jake imprinting on the baby is therefore disturbing.  I love Quil and Claire and I totally get the platonic nature of imprinting on a child, but Jake just becomes a slave to the evil demon child.  It's not cute, it's just convenient.  Jake should have imprinted or fallen in love with Leah.  They have both been broken by people who they loved who had \\"imprinted\\" on someone else.  They are perfect for one another.  And here's a thought, how about having them actually fall in love with each other rather than being suddenly linked by magic?  Their natural bond (which would have been similar to Bella and Jacob's if Ed had not returned) could have been a touching counter point to everyone else's magical love.  It could have been nearly as beautiful as Bella and Edward's love.  Jake could have been deservingly happy with a love based on mutual respect and understanding.  And they would have bred strong wolf pups, perfect!    I don't have an issue with Bella's gift of self-control.  She was always overly protective of everyone and didn't want anyone to get hurt so being able to control her blood lust is a fitting gift.  However, the protective shield and being able to share her mind with Ed was just too much.  I was already sickened by the all too perfect wrap up of Bella, Edward, and Jake, and then we have to make her a super vampire on top of it all.  Gag!      And then Bella's new vampire life with Edwards is relatively boring so let's have another vampire fight, shall we?  The confrontation with the Volturi was exclusively for tying up loose ends and lacked any drama because I knew that they would just find a way to explain the baby, like Bella wanted to in the first place, and all would be well.  Bella and Edward's dread over them never concerned me.    So, basically, I think that the downfall of the book is that we loose the Bella and Edward that we love.  This is due to forcing of the wrap-up plot which lacked the opportunity for Bella and Edward to emotionally conclude their tale with the reader.  This was then exacerbated by the section from Jacob's perspective that has zero purpose if nothing happens with Leah.  Edward would have been a more appropriate narrator for that section.  He could have just read Jake's mind and told us about the episode with Sam and his breaking the Alpha chains.  We would then have been more emotionally tied to what was happening with Bella and Edward rather that just horrified.  Maybe then we could have come to terms with what actually happens.

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Ok, honestly, i struggle to think of a better picture.<br /><br />this is MORE than a kids movie, it is a complex story about life.<br />it is great for all ages, full of quotes... and tears.<br /><br />it is not a light film, but it is light hearted at times.<br />the message is the best ever.<br /><br />I do not want to give it away, just watch it.<br />let yourself be moved.<br /><br />:)

B000A0GYD2|5.0|After working on the Ron Howard movie 'Apollo 13', Tom Hanks decided to help create this wonderful mini-series about the Apollo moon program. It is a 12 part series that covers many aspects of the Apollo program: from the tragedy of Apollo 1 to the evolution of journalism during Apollo 13. From the committees of Washington, DC to the craters of the moon, this mini-series takes the viewer on an amazing journey.<br /><br />This movie was shot in the 'Apollo 13' fashion in the aspect that this is not a documentary...it is more of a movie.<br /><br />The acting is extremely well done. The music (done by several composers) ties the movie together very well.<br /><br />The rocket launches and the space scenes are a combination of real footage from the Apollo era and realistic computer-generated effects (especially in the first episode directed by Tom Hanks).<br /><br />Amazon recently lowered the price of this mini-series to $14.99. I bought this series about four years ago and it cost me $59.00...and I would gladly pay that again. For $14.99 you get basically a 12 hour movie with a 30 minute documentary on the making of the film. Basically, you are getting an amazing deal.<br /><br />5/5

B000SVZIDA|1.0|The movie was so long and drawn out with nothing but songs. Even the first fifteen minutes had nothing but musicals. My entire family had to shut this movie off and return it for a full refund at our local rental store it was so bad.    If you have a taste for cheesy musicals with a bad story line then this just might be your movie.     The movie felt like it was so drawn out even in the first fifteen minutes of watching it! I would say this was the worst musical movie ever!
B002QH2NUA|2.0|Paul. What the what is this??<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I love any and every Beatles and McCartney tune, but...<br /><br />I don't understand. The auto-tune level on this \\"live\\" album is so strong and overwhelming that it begins to sound like a terrible imitation of Paul and not Paul himself. He does manage to cover a lot of ground with the lengthy setlist, but the over-production becomes nauseating after only a few tracks.<br /><br />This just made me lose a substantial amount of respect for Paul. And made me not want to listen to Beatles music for awhile.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor: before you even begin to think about getting this miserable excuse for a record, go to your local record store and get some Beatles remasters. That is where the good stuff lies.<br /><br />I'll be gracious and give this two stars, only because it's Beatles music.

B002QEXN2K|3.0|There is no doubt in my mind that pop veteran John Mayer can write pleasant pop music and accent it nicely with excellent guitar playing. Battle Studies tries to incorporate a small portion of each, assumedly, to keep his pop and his trio fans both satisfied.<br /><br />Musically, Battle Studies is a small departure from past Mayer recordings. Of course, Mayer experiments with new guitar sounds (\\"Half of My Heart,\\" \\"Crossroads,\\" \\"Edge of Desire\\"), but the basic principle of his writing says the same; focus on simplicity.<br /><br />While many of the tracks are initially acceptable, they are rarely truly completed in their arrangements. Potentially great tracks like \\"Edge of Desire,\\" \\"Perfectly Lonely,\\" and \\"Heartbreak Warfare\\" lack a simple variation at their middle or end points and, consequently, become substantially redundant before they reach their end points. \\"Perfectly Lonely\\" especially banks on repetition to fill out a wide open arrangement, but it isn't nearly effective enough to bring the tune home.<br /><br />Mayer even attempts a Cream/Clapton classic, \\"Crossroads,\\" midway through his newest product. He certainly manages to suck every bit of emotion and human characteristic out of the track. The MIDI-sounding guitar effect is a wreck, and the poppy format is nauseating.<br /><br />And don't even get me started on lead single \\"Who Says.\\" The guitar arrangement is the polar opposite of creative, the lyrics are lazy and meaningless, and the tune is instantly forgettable. It's just plain poor songwriting, and why he chose this specific track for inclusion on Battle Studies (or any album, for that matter) is so far beyond me that I cannot express it to you with actual words.<br /><br />But Battle Studies does have its small victories; these tracks being \\"All We Ever Do Is Say Goodbye,\\" \\"Half of My Heart,\\" \\"Do You Know Me,\\" but the rest of the album is nothing overwhelmingly special on the first listen. Mayer seems to be bent on experimentation, but doesn't seem to want to completely abandon the pop ship he considers a safe haven. For example:<br /><br />\\"Half of My Heart,\\" while a perfect pop song, is a surprisingly obvious ploy from Mayer for extra popularity, thanks to a random appearance by Taylor Swift. Swift's guest \\"vocals\\" are, in part, pointless; and, in part, puzzling. Taylor Swift has nothing exclusive to offer here; her vocal range, creativity, and tone are nothing that a similar (or more talented) vocal artist could have pulled off here, including Mayer himself. Additionally, Swift's voice is never actually heard too clearly during the track, which is where the puzzling part comes into place. In essence, Mayer is using Swift strictly for her current popularity, and this is unnecessary and intolerable for someone like Mayer who should not feel like he has to stoop to such levels to gain a #1 hit radio spot.<br /><br />In conclusion, Mayer manages to make an unbelievably bland record even more generic with haphazard \\"special guests,\\" unpolished attempts at experimentation, and a complete lack of cohesion and progression. What a disappointment. I vote that John Mayer worries less about who says he can't get stoned, and more about making actual music. (5.5/10)ship he considers a safe haven.

So one star for the price, 4 stars for the movie, I just hope the transfer is good in Hidef as the movie if very dark at times.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|The series doesn't exactly follow the text, which reads like a documentary or commentary or diary/journal (which, of course, it was).I read it first in 1981 and reread it after watching the series a month ago.  The series is lively, romantic, character driven, and fun--I fell in love with it.  The book doesn't exactly plod, but the 1800s in the English countryside described by Thompson were far from glamorous.  The series focuses on the second part of the book and Laura's move from Lark Rise to Candelford, whereas the book's main focus is the folk of Lark Rise, basically because Thompson didn't want their way of life to be forgotten in the mad rush to modernize and move on into the industrial age.  If you can't read the text, be sure to watch the series as it attempts to cover the entire gamut from poverty to romance and from folklore to Paris fashion in the England of Laura's youth.  The characters are well drawn, and I don't think you'll soon forget them.  If you're looking for a photocopy of the book, however, you'll not get one.

0316067598|2.0|the story is a compelling one - U.S. Seals go into afghanastan to rid the country of the \\"bad guys\\". The problem is the story is just not well written. The first 100 pages are monotonous, rehashing the same background of what SEAL training is like. Ok, its a tough slog. That could be said in one chapter. The more interesting part of the story is the character's time in afghanastan and that is religated to the way back of the book.    If this had been written by a more talented author/ghost writer this could be an outstanding book. Instead it is only an \\"ok\\" book.
B002QEXN2K|4.0|This album is very soft rock/easy listening and lacks the soulful/blues sound and feeling that Continuum has. It also doesn't rock as much. I don't like it as much as Continuum but can certainly understand that any musician doesn't want to repeat themselves when they make a new album.<br /><br />There are a few songs on Battle Studies that are really very good such as 'Perfectly Lonely'. There are a few that are pretty bland and personally, I hate the song 'Crossroads' and cringe every time I hear it. In my opinion, it doesn't belong on this album.<br /><br />Lyrically and musically Battle Studies doesn't  quite compare to Continuum but it's still quite an enjoyable album by a talented musician.

B002NWRMVS|3.0|I will start introducing that I am a Norah Jones fan, not a hard one, but I do enjoy her music. As soon as \\"The Fall\\" showed up on the top of the lists I was excited and looked forward to it as probably a lot did. Sometimes I think that anticipation is such a bad thing because there is a higher possibility you may get disappointed. And I was not. Kind of.. Now that I have heard the whole album for three times I might have a clue what happened here.<br /><br />I would like to start with the cover of the album. I dare to say that is the best cover of her, kind of magical, like from stories. Does not make any huge difference though. I am glad that Norah Jones chose to title her album \\"The Fall\\". It seems just for her. You know, you could predict that music will be melancholic, jazzy or relaxing. But is it?<br /><br />A lot of people know Norah by the songs \\"Come Away With Me\\", \\"Don't Know Why\\" or \\"Sunrise\\". And why is that? Why these songs? As for me, I think that her key for capturing so many fans' hearts is the greatness of how she controls the melancholy in her music. Her vocal is itself amazing and sometimes it seems that whatever she sang it would be still nice. The piano? It seemed that piano was built for her or she built the piano herself. Nevertheless, I missed That charm in \\"The Fall\\". Not entirely, but..<br /><br />Norah Jones had jazz and pop influences in her music, maybe a little of some other genres, but in this album, I think, plenty of blues-rock and country-like influence could be detected. I do not have anything against country, however, it does not really suit Jones' music. And you know what? If I had to list the best tracks of the album, those would be the most similar to the previous releases. It is kind of weird. On the other hand, this fact shows what her strongest side is.<br /><br />The songs in the album are really uneven. There are some absolutely good songs and some \\"Uh?\\" ones. Perhaps the \\"Uh?\\" thing should go away after more listens, I mean, just to get used to the sound but. You cannot just like it because it is Norah Jones. Would not be fair. I have a disturbing feeling when listening to the most of the songs in this album, that I have already heard them somewhere before. Especially \\"It's Gonna Be\\" (maybe some \\"Fever\\" here. I am not sure) or \\"You've Ruined Me\\". \\"Light As A Feather\\" reminds me of Morcheeba's song \\"Enjoy The Ride\\", a little bit of course. But what the point is that she kind of lost herself. Which is neither good nor bad, yet disappointing.<br /><br />In general, it is a good album. It has its weaknesses and its strengths. I suppose people will like it, fans should get it, and new to Norah Jones people probably would not have that impressions as a fan like me. I am giving it three stars because of the poor tracks and for Something lost that I cannot really explain (I tried though).<br /><br />Key tracks:<br />- Light As A Feather<br />- Waiting<br />- It's Gonna Be<br />- Back To Manhatten<br />- Decembernd but.

B0029LHW4U|5.0|Hope... A new beginning...<br /><br />  Right from the first notes of the new album Alice in Chains let us know this is the right time for the new beginning. And it is clear this is not the AIC that we used to know but it feels quite similar. Both musically and graphically the approach for the new album seems to flow right from where the Tripod was left off. Instead of focusing on either the amplified or the acoustic sound they blend them both into one versatile collection of songs mostly speaking of rebirth and fighting personal demons. Of note is the cover art elaborating on the medical theme already present on Tripod however here it is to serve more of the emotion painted by the ripped out heart. The singles up to now are: Looking in View - about the feeling of being locked up within your own self; Check My Brain - Jerry Cantrell's feelings about moving to L. A.; Your Decision - fighting the fear. Other significant tracks on the album are IMHO When the Sun Rose Again, Private Hell and the haunting Black Gives Way to Blue... for me the beautiful refrain of the song alone justifies this band to have a future long and prosperous career. The only song I dig less is Lesson Learned.<br />  It has been said by many that the new frontman is not so upfront on this album and I tend to agree with that. However as also was mentioned this could be to introduce him to the fans with Jerry serving as a backbone on which William would eventually build his own place to dwell. He does however step up in Last of My Kind and does so quite well. I can't help myself to finish this with the final lyrics:<br /><br />Lay down black gives way to blue<br />Lay down I'll remember you...

B0016HNOXQ|5.0|Review from Melt Magazine - Columbus, OH<br /><br />Anyone who first sampled Portishead's equally sulky and scintillating, espionage influenced trip-hop after 1998 surely had a dream or two crushed under the weight of the trio's ten year hiatus from touring and releasing new material.  Roseland NYC Live, authenticated the bands short but sweet legacy with one of the most prolific, profound and exceedingly produced live performances ever birthed by the human condition.  With Third we find beloved singer Beth Gibbons ditching the hooky choruses that made the first two albums, in favor of a dynamically diminishing delivery that drops the demeanor of the new tracks to a chilling degree of alienation compared to the cool, easier-to-relate-to gloom of earlier work.  The in-house production from Geoff Barrow is equally unhinged offering only a few glimpses of the old formula through a veil of experimental song structure. The sounds themselves bring to mind an image of the trio carrying a laptop into the musky music room of an old English estate that was abandoned in the 1930's and setting up studio amongst rickey organs and warped, rusty and otherwise ruined instruments.  An insolent aspect  of Portishead's unnerving new personality comes across in the albums first single \\"Machine Gun\\", a track that is two minutes of song followed by two minutes of repetitive, ring modulated drum samples.  Those fans expecting a return to form or a jovial resurrection are met by an album that makes an infallible case against the old saying \\"time heals all wounds\\".  Third sounds like ten years worth of suffering in all the right ways.  - Tyler Starkey<br /><br />[...].

B0014I4KIK|3.0|The Welsh pop-soul sensation-on-the-rise Duffy, has caught a major break through to mainstream audiences abroad with her first full length release Rockferry, and for good reason.  The album opens with the Titanic sized grand piano riff of the title track which is immediately followed by Duffy's powerful, soul shaking vox sounding like they are reverberating off the walls an empty music hall.  The track builds to an empowering, climactic reprise chorus that should be enough to entice even the skeptic into letting the disc play out.  From there, the nine other links in this chain seem to be welded with equal precision and gleaming with a fresh coat of chrome.  The success of Rockferry has sparked some controversy within the music business, namely because Duffy's singing style so easily falls on skeptical (or in some cases, envious) ears as a blatant Amy Winehouse rip off.  Singer-songwriter Alison Goldfrapp said \\"while Duffy has a great voice, she was trained to sound essentially like Amy Winehouse as part of a business plan.\\"  British hip hop singer Estelle criticized Duffy for misrepresenting genuine soul music. Duffy partially agreed with the criticism in that she is not trying to \\"define\\" soul music, but disputed the assertion that race should be an issue.  In my opinion the similarity between Duffy and Winehouse is uncanny, and assuming that Winehouse's mega-success played no role in paving the way for another white, female soul star is naive.  However, Rockferry expresses a distinctly different flavor of british girl power that is a cutsie PG version of heartbreak compared to Winehouse's rowdy, alcoholic antics.  Nevertheless the girl's got soul, and Rockferry rocks. - Tyler Starkey<br />[...]

B002JIOQCO|3.0|Vocalist and guitarist, Andrew Stockdale couldn't have picked a more appropriate title for his first release after failing to reconcile the \\"personal and musical differences\\" with the founding rhythm section of the original Wolfmother lineup.  Cosmic Egg, released late last month, bears a name evocative of a future rebirth, grandiose in scale yet trapped in a developmental stage.  I highly doubt Stockdale had this demeaning interpretation when he chose the name in yoga class while holding the 'cosmic egg', a pose akin to fetal position, as [...] recently reported.  While the motives behind the frontman's naming convention are not entirely known, one thing is undoubtedly true about Cosmic Egg. This is a guitar player's record to the utmost degree.<br /><br />Upon initially riffing through the new tracks, the most apparent change in the sound is not surprisingly, coming form the drums.  The punchy, simplified beats sound cleaned-up in contrast to the spastic, biting, true-vinatge sound from the band's debut, allowing for more layers of guitar to fill the sonic space.  The leading single \\"New Moon Rising\\" lives up to Wolfmother's over-comparison to Sabbath and Zeppelin with it's nostalgic, pop-stoner, prog-rockiness and boasts a pretty cool chorus hook that gets a little repetitive partially due to it's failure to engage the listener lyrically.  A few tracks later, \\"Sundial\\" sparks some interest with it's roaring, fuzz-wah riffage running rampant, oh, and there's the keyboard player... one note seriously? Lest we forget, it's all about the guitar people, as even the vocals exist in a hazy pocket behind the guitar amps most of the time, probably for the best, as the lyrics really just take up space.  Space that could have been filled with guitar. A few slower songs and a few more fantasy ballads pass by before our journey through the Cosmic Egg comes to a conclusion.  In the end, it works as a logical step forward, given the circumstances, but as a contribution to the throw-back rock revival, it might come across as a little soft boiled. - Tyler Starkey<br /><br />[...]k rock revival, it might come across as a little soft boiled. - Tyler Starkey    [...]
B002U9JEVA|5.0|Norah Jones has released another strong album with excellent music and a creativity that grabs me by the throat and never lets me go until the very last note! Norah is in outstanding form throughout this album and the music fits perfectly with her vocals. The quality of the sound is faultless and the cover artwork, a portrait by photographer Autumn de Wilde, is very well done.<br /><br />There are so many great numbers on this album; there's not a dud in the bunch. Some especially great numbers include \\"Chasing Pirates\\" which grows more and more on me every time I listen to it; \\"Chasing Pirates\\" is a fine song with which to start the track set and I'm very impressed with Norah's performance. In addition, listen for \\"Young Blood\\" with those awesome guitars; and there's the amazing \\"It's Gonna Be\\" with a sound that has me tapping my foot to the beat without my even realizing it--\\"It's Gonna Be\\" is definitely a highlight of this CD. \\"Tell Yer Mama\\" has a country twist to it that works wonders for this ballad; and Norah delivers this without ever letting go of a single superfluous note. \\"Even Though,\\" \\"Waiting\\" and especially \\"You've Ruined Me\\" are passionate songs that feature Norah effortlessly handling tempo and key changes like a pro--of course, we know it really wasn't all that easy. Norah's talent carries her through.<br /><br />The CD ends with two terrific numbers, the beautiful \\"Man of the Hour\\" (which is about her actually wanting a dog instead of a man) and \\"Can't Stop.\\" These songs are quite memorable and I really like the way they close the album.<br /><br />Norah Jones fans should consider this a must-have for their collections; and this also makes a fine starter CD for anyone just discovering the magical artistry of Norah Jones.
B002LMOCJ0|5.0|I don't think some people really understand blu-rays.  Movies like this that might be \\"lo-def\\" can still look and sound better on Blu-ray simply because the image and sound isn't compressed as it would be on a DVD.<br /><br />If you're interested in upgrading you'll be very pleased with the overall presentation along with a bonus documentary on the making of Jay and Silent Bob.  Smith fans will definitely want to check this out.<br /><br />If you haven't seen Clerks yet you're missing out.  It's one of the best comedies released in the 90's.

0439023483|4.0|Each year twenty-four teens in this futuristic setting in North America are forced to fight to their death in Suzanne Collins' book The Hunger Games. When Katniss younger sister's name gets draw she steps in to take her sister place. Now she must outwit the other twenty-three tributes including Peeta who is from her district. He publicly professes his love for her prior to the games starting. Kaniss is instructed to play along, but she us unaware that Petta is not playing the game. Find out what happens when the Capital changes the rules half way through the game. Will Katniss survive and if so, what are her true feeling for Petta?<br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading about the struggles this young girls faced and about how she relied more on logic that on her emotions to play the game. Suzanne adds just the right twist at the end to make me want to run out and get Catching Fire.

The run down of how much corn or things that ate corn or used to be part of corn are in fast food was very mind opening.

Most importantly, a solid discussion on converting twitter into clients, how to behave, what to say, not to say, how to measure return on investment.  A worthy read for any firm!

B000ION23A|1.0|First, the premise of this film is essentially that what boys need is a good dose of feminism to teach them how to be men. Second, the scene in which Julia Roberts' character stings the pest control man on the genitals was totally inappropriate for children. In fact, it was just downright inappropriate for anyone. But it set the tone for this movie more than any other scene. If you have boys, get them something else.
B000069HJN|2.0|This could have been a nice album but it is obvious that the genius himself, Rodger Hogdson, is missing.  The tracks are simply boring. Some of them starts well, but they never \\"lift off\\" like older Supertramp albums.    The sound is very good though, and the title track is partly exciting.
B001AVCFK6|4.0|The movie is an epic journey that covers 25 years of time.  It starts the day that James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) is born.  Through brief clips, we watch him grow up to become the \\"smartest repeat offender in Iowa.\\"  Meanwhile, we also watch Spock (Zachary Quinto) grow up on Vulcan.  Half Vulcan and half Human, Spock struggles with where he really belongs.<br /><br />Just as Kirk is finishing his academy training, an old nemesis comes back.  Nero (Eric Bana), a Romulan, has been waiting 25 years to finish extracting his revenge.  But just what is his plan?  Can Kirk stop it?  And where will the next member of the Enterprise crew pop up?<br /><br />Even though I've only seen maybe half a dozen of the Original Series movies, I knew enough to know what characters to watch for.  And a few of them pop up in the best places.  I actually had to laugh the first time we saw Scotty (Simon Pegg).  They take some liberties with the characters (or my understanding of them at least), but it worked well for this movie.<br /><br />When I described this movie as an epic journey, I wasn't exaggerating.  It feels much longer than its running time.  That's not a bad thing because I was entertained the entire time.  It starts slowly, establishing the characters of Spock and Kirk, but once the villain reemerges, it grows intense quickly.  And it balances some very serious drama with some truly funny laughs.  The action is great, especially as we near the climax, and the effects bring everything to life.<br /><br />There is not a weak performance in the cast, but that is especially true or our two leads.  I've only ever seen Chris Pine as a romantic lead, but he makes a great action hero.  I'm not even slightly surprised to report that Zachary Quinto absolutely nails Spock.  When he was cast, I couldn't picture a better actor, and that holds true after having seen it.<br /><br />This movie is a reboot of the Star Trek franchise.  I knew that going in, but they way they did it left me with a very sad feeling.  But it was also a great way to go about it, and my friends who are fans don't seem to mind how it was handled.<br /><br />I feel like I've been on a grand journey, and I am curious where they will take Star Trek from here.

0385737947|3.0|A hundred or so teenage boys, their memories wiped, are trapped in the center of a gigantic shifting maze, many miles across.  As the book begins, Thomas arrives in the \\"Glade\\" -- the center of the maze, where they all live.  The next day the first girl ever shows up too.  And everything begins to change.<br /><br />While living in the center of a giant ever-changing maze full of monsters is an extremely odd way to live, the boys have made do.  After two years, they have a ruling council, they grow food, raise animals, and look after any sick or injured.  They also send out trained runners to map the maze every day, in search of an exit, or a pattern, or some clue as to what they're doing here.<br /><br />With the arrival of Thomas and the girl, the Gladers' carefully-crafted order begins to break down.  Now solving and escaping the maze is immediately necessary. Fortunately, Thomas isn't quite like all the other Gladers, and is able to help.<br /><br />The premise is great, and the plot moves well.  There's a lot of action and the tension constantly builds. Unfortunately, the story failed in two important aspects for me.<br /><br />First, the the maze itself is so absurd, the final explanation had better be pretty impressive for the story to hang together.  And at least for me, the explanation was not plausible.  Though, at least there *is* an explanation, which is more than can be said for some stories I've encountered!<br /><br />The second weakness was the characters.  I'd be okay with a somewhat implausible scenario if the characters were likable enough.  But, Thomas is bland and whiny, and his only moments of greatness arise from his forgotten past.  The other boys are mostly hostile and uninteresting. Not, mind you, that I expect deep, sophisticated personalities from amnesiac teenage boys! They were all believable, but they weren't compelling enough to carry the story.  Neither was the new girl very interesting.  Thomas is attracted to her, but again, that's an artifact of his past, not a real live reaction that we get to watch develop.<br /><br />Overall, it was a fun read, and I don't regret the time spent, but I won't look for the sequels.live reaction that we get to watch develop.

0439023483|5.0|Let's pretend for a minute or two that it is the distant future right now, perhaps around 2065 or something like that. The United States of America has been completely destroyed and is now taken over by Panem, a new country divided into districts. Every year comes this big event that is the most watched nationwide (and worldwide) event on TV: The Hunger Games, an event that lasts for a few days and where people have but one objective: to kill each other until they survive. Now wouldn't that be something?<br /><br />I wasn't going to give into the hype, especially since a lot of the time, things get overhyped and when you read them they turn out to be unsatisfactory as best. Even moreso, I was afraid to read it when I saw the praise from Stephenie Meyer on the front over, seeing as she did the same thing with that godawful book \\"City of Bones\\" (It's no surprise, seeing as she wrote one of the most mind-bogglingly awful franchises ever, which would be \\"Twilight\\"). But then again, don't judge a book by it's cover. And upon reading the story, I thought it would be a cheap Battle Royale ripoff, which has a similar plot (people kill each other until one is left alive), but I gave in anyways after a friend strongly recommended it. He was practically glowing when he told me how good it was. \\"Alright, I guess\\", said I.<br /><br />I rented this book from the Library yesterday and managed to finish it all in 4 hours (I'm a bit of a fast reader, I can finish a 300-400 page book in a day depending on how good it is). I must say, not since \\"Q&A\\" has a book had me on the edge of my seat for the duration of it's page length! I wasn't expecting much, but I LOVED it. Finally, in the age of Countless books with overhyped characters like Edward Cullen and Eragon, comes a book with characters that are likeable and a plot that manages to keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time. I'm not lying, I hated having to put this book down since it's SO GOOD!<br /><br />Not a single character here is unlikeable by any means. Every character is likealbe. Katniss and Peeta are fun characters, and I thought the sexual tension between them was hilarious! Primrose, who is Katniss' sister, is a very cute and innocent character. Katniss is, finally a strong female character. SHe is not a Mary Sue, she does not mope and whine about her life and she becomes badass in the last chapters of the book. I can envision Peeta as a handsome and quirky character, he was one of the best things about it. Admit it guys, you were on the edge of the seat for him, hoping he survived! And Rue, boy would I love to have Rue as a friend.<br /><br />This book is definitely not for Children. The violence is infrequent, but when it comes it's very brutal and gory. The final showdown is very intense and well written. The fight scenes are well written, and very brutal- there's quite a bit of action towards the end of the book, which does have you on the edge of your seat. There isn't any swearing too- I'm not a prude, but I thought it was cool how she managed to tell the story without profanity in it.<br /><br />Another thing about this book that was cool was the fact that it was written in Present tense. This seems to make the story more realistic, especially how Collins creates a sense of urgency in the writing. It's almost like you're watching the show itself. She manages to make it like a movie with how exciting it is, and I sure hope a movie of this book comes.<br /><br />In short, this was a surprisingly great book, and my new favortie too.

B000BYRCGU|3.0|I liked this movie a lot. Some parts are predictable, but let's face it, so many movies are. Great views of the islands, blue waters, dolphins, sharks, and PAUL WALKER is in his usually fine form! Don't worry boys, Jessica Alba wears some teeny weeny bikinis for your viewing pleasure. This movie was based on a 1977 film by the same name. The difference involves morphin instead of coke, and a sunken ship rather than a down airplane. Worth your money. Watch it on a night when you are pooped and want an easy watch that will take you by the hand and walk you to the end credits. No brain surgeons required to get the gist of this flick.
0385504225|5.0|I read Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons before reading this one.  Both times, I was so enthralled by the stories that I wanted to pick up the books and read at stop lights!  Every spare second I had, I wanted my face in the books!  When I saw that the Lost Symbol was released, I couldn't wait to read it.  I wanted to see if Dan Brown could captivate me again!       The history, humanity, tragedy, beauty, good vs. evil, twists and turns kept those pages turning!  I tore through the book with voracity and could not rest until I reached the end!  What an exciting, thrilling, enlightening, entertaining, and enjoyable book it was!  Brown forces the reader into somewhat of a quagmire:  tear through the book like I did, satisfying the curiosity that he continually evokes, or slowly savor the story and ponder the many details, delaying the persistent urge to know what happens next!  My only complaint is that it ended!  He did it again!

B002HWRYJE|5.0|This movie is a perfect example of the atmosphere of the original series and I feel that a lot of people are missing out on that. Star Trek wasn't a series that originally prided itself on projected scientific data or theories, nor did it prove to have writing of a Shakespearean quality. Instead, the show was intended to be fun and entertaining.  It doesn't matter if there's a little bit of silliness permeating the movie as the TV series displayed much of the same. The people stating that Star Trek (well, at least TOS) is the ultimate highbrow entertainment should really reconsider what they've been watching all these years and stop viewing with rosy hues of nostalgia!

1433502410|5.0|My encounter with this Bible came after reconnecting with a friend (a seminary student) on Facebook who I hadn't seen in over 15 years. I was delighted to see that he has his own church now in Ohio with webcasts of his sermons. During one of his sermons he pointed out that he preached from the ESV which I was unfamiliar with. Back in the day we both used the NIV. So, since I wanted to follow his sermons each week I bought the ESV Study Bible. The positive reviews here are accurate. It is a great study Bible! I love the MacArthur Study Bible because he is so thorough and his conclusions on difficult verses are hard to argue with. But, I believe the ESV is just as thorough if not more so as, as some here have already mentioned, it gives a more generous helping of alternate viewpoints than the MacArthur Bible. Frankly, I would hate to have to give up either Bible. I like this Bible so much that I am ordering 2 more for some friends. I think it should be in every Christian's library!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|When this film was released a few months ago, it came in the wake of very, very generous reviews.  Toted as one of the best action films of the year, one of the best origin style remakes of the decade and one of the best science fiction films, well, ever, `Star Trek' had mighty big shoes to fill before it ever even graced the theater screen.<br /><br />Guess what?<br /><br />It delivers!<br /><br />With the expansion of Oscar's `Best Picture' category a lot of my friends are anxiously awaiting a Best Picture nomination for the mighty `Star Trek', and while I am nearly positive that will not happen I will guaranty you that this film will grace quite a few critics top ten lists, and rightfully so.  Some have claimed this to be a masterpiece in filmmaking, and while I will not be quick to call it that (I still heavily prefer Nolan's masterpiece `The Dark Knight') I will say that this is the most fun I have had in the theater in years, and what Abrams does here is astonishing, really.<br /><br />I think what makes `Star Trek' work so well is that it accepts the humor that can be found in the idea behind this film without ever falling into camp, but elevating that said humor with a genuinely serious tone, marvelously crafted action sequences, stirring character development and an intelligent plot that actually prods at our thinking capacities.  This film could have easily been nothing more than a hodgepodge of explosions and aliens and steamy chemistry between the slew of `hot young things' gracing the screen.  Instead of giving us a generic, clich&eacute;d take on the series, Abrams and company reinvent it, bringing it up to date and giving us something that longstanding fans will gobble up, but that newly converted followers can also thoroughly enjoy.<br /><br />To be frank, I kind of hate `Star Trek' the television series, and I found the previous films to be rather stupid (don't pelt me please).  But that is the beauty of this film.  Someone like me, who would never bother to watch the TV show even if I was bored and had nothing else to do, can sit back and become completely overtaken by this fantastic film.<br /><br />I don't really see a purpose in going into the plot here, since it is the gradual unveiling that makes this film so intense and gratifying, but in short (and this should be harmless) the film really elaborates on how Kirk became captain of the Starship Enterprise and how his bond with Spock was formed.  It also goes to great lengths to flesh out these two men as peers, enemies and eventual comrades.  Yes, there is dangers looming thanks to the evil Nero and his planet destroying mission, but the heart of this film can be summed up in the relationship between Kirk and Spock.<br /><br />My wife spent the entirety of this film drooling over Chris Pine, who she feels looks like a young Brad Pitt.  While she was drooling I was admiring his spunky take on Kirk.  I am not a fan of William Shatner so I was interested to see how Pine (a relative unknown until this year) would handle the character.  He blew me away.  He was cool and collected with perfect touches of angst and rebellion.  Zachary Quinto is impeccable as Spock, delivering a top-notch performance of a man fighting his own emotions so as to fit in with his people.  There is a ferocious restraint he uses so that one can always sense the toll this is taking on him as a person.  Zoe Saldana is stunning.  Yeah, I don't know what else to say.  She delivers a nice performance, but above all else, she is STUNNING.  Simon Pegg is a complete scene stealer (what else is new) as Scotty.  He's hilarious.

1449512569|5.0|I had to discover G. K. Chesterton all by myself, when I was a teenager --- in the school library.  He had written so many books, on so many interesting topics!  I borrowed four or five and was enthralled by his humor, his clear insight, and his brilliant writing style.<br /><br />Take this book \\"Orthodoxy.\\"  Could there be a more boring title?  Yet, if you dare to open to the first page, you're off on a wild, non-stop ride where Chesterton makes a number of points that seem to me beyond dispute.<br /><br />After all, you would not really expect Chapter One of such a presumably \\"dull\\" book to be about maniacs, but it is.  And Chesterton makes one point over and over again: the people who become insane typically reason too much.  A paranoid psychotic is full of reasons and logical arguments which all seem to make perfect sense, but the lunatic remains, unfortunately, a lunatic.  If I may draw a parallel to today, the people who believe in UFO's (or the Truthers) are all full of logical arguments which they will gladly repeat, and repeat endlessly, forever travelling around the circumference of the tiny circle which imprisons them.<br /><br />On the other hand, men of great imagination seem to be marvellously sane.  Chesterton mentions Shakespeare; a more modern writer might mention Tolkien.  They were both men of stupendous imagination, and they did NOT live within the tiny \\"logical\\" world of their own madness.<br /><br />As chance would have it, I am investigating Kant right now, and everything I have read up to this point tells me that Kant ringingly \\"proved\\" that the outside world exists pretty much as we observe it.<br /><br />This may be a really important point for philosophers, but it is not something which needs argument with the huge majority of people.  You see your girl-friend kissing another guy, and you don't go to Kant for the answer to the question \\"What do I do NOW?\\"  Kant is not precisely an expert on the jealous heart, although he would be sure to remind you that both your girl-friend and the other guy must be treated as \\"ends in themselves.\\"<br /><br />No.  Mankind has always gone to religion to answer the really tough questions about being human, and the orthodox Christian will run right up against the commandment \\"Thou shalt not kill.\\"<br /><br />What Chesterton does, is to put such issues into bold relief.  If you go to an atheist materialist such as I believe Dawkins to be, he may well be a determinist to boot, and feel that it is a waste of time to even speak with you, since *FATE* is the master of all, and there is no *FREE WILL*.  Oddly enough, the man who denies these ideas is quite likely to be a Catholic priest.  And he'll bring up the commandment \\"Thou shalt not kill\\" without apology or even much explanation.<br /><br />Most of this book is a ringing and funny defense of \\"common sense\\" --- and the sense of wonder which existence often brings to us.  After all, even Immanuel Kant had on his tombstone:<br /><br />\\"Two things fill the heart with ever renewed and increasing awe and reverence, the more often and the more steadily we meditate upon them: *the starry firmament above* and *the moral sense within.* \\"<br /><br />You might consider reading this book along with [[ASIN:0465019374 The Devil's Delusion: Atheism and its Scientific Pretensions]].  They are both excellent, funny, and stimulating!<br /><br />A Chesterton quote from \\"Orthodoxy\\" to ponder: \\"It is true that a man (a silly man) might make change itself his obect or ideal.  But as an ideal, change itself becomes unchangeable.  If the change-worshiper wishes to estimate his own progress, he must be sternly loyal to the ideal of change; he must not begin to flirt gaily with the ideal of monotony.  Progress itself cannot progress.\\"<br /><br />To sum up: \\"Orthodoxy\\" is simply a classic.the other guy must be treated as \\"ends in themselves.\\"    No.  Mankind has always gone to religion to answer the really tough questions about being human, and the orthodox Christian will run right up against the commandment \\"Thou shalt not kill.\\"    What Chesterton does, is to put such issues into bold relief.

After all, even Immanuel Kant had on his tombstone:    \\"Two things fill the heart with ever renewed and increasing awe and reverence, the more often and the more steadily we meditate upon them: *the starry firmament above* and *the moral sense within.* \\"    You might consider reading this book along with [[ASIN:0465019374 The Devil's Delusion: Atheism and its Scientific Pretensions]].  They are both excellent, funny, and stimulating!    A Chesterton quote from \\"Orthodoxy\\" to ponder: \\"It is true that a man (a silly man) might make change itself his obect or ideal.  But as an ideal, change itself becomes unchangeable.  If the change-worshiper wishes to estimate his own progress, he must be sternly loyal to the ideal of change; he must not begin to flirt gaily with the ideal of monotony.  Progress itself cannot progress.\\"    To sum up: \\"Orthodoxy\\" is simply a classic.
B000059Z8J|4.0|Watched this a long time ago when I was a kid and thought it was great. It wasn't as good as I remember it from way back then but it's still fun to watch and I enjoyed seeing it again.     On a separate note, I purchased this directly from Amazon and the DVD case was broken on the inside when I got it so the DVD was loose and had a bunch of scratches on it :( Could have been poor handling by the mail service though, I don't know. DVD played okay still but I'm mad about the scratches on a brand new DVD!
B00006CXSS|4.0|Michael Kamen \\"borrowed\\" \\"his\\" main music theme for the Band of Brothers from Beethoven's Symphonie no. 2 in D major. Otherwise a well executed and written series, which I enjoyed watching. Slightly over-hyped maybe. But nevertheless positively boosting heroism, diversity and humanity in men at the same time.
B000RJO57I|3.0|Got this free through a Pepsi promotion. I would not have paid money to get this movie. Not really my kind of comedy, but since it was free, it was fun to watch the first time and I'll likely watch it again down the road sometime. It did have it's funny parts though, and the outtakes were fun to watch.
B002NWRMVS|4.0|Very much like Beck's Sea Change but not nearly as heartbreaking.  Norahs voice is gorgeous however and the live bonus disc sounds rich and without applause (only at the end of each song)  so a nice addition.  Target has the exclusive bonus disc.  Wal Mart dot com has a bonus track, a stripped down version of Young Blood.
B00000I4XR|4.0|Seen this a long time ago when I was a kid and it's still a lot of fun to watch now. Visuals are not that great of course, but the humor is funny and there are lots of interesting \\"fun facts\\" to learn about various parts of the film.
B002WXO6JO|5.0|Well the title says it all: Time. By the title you can imply a lot about the episode, add in a solar flare and a wormhole and you have a plot.    As for the series, not a critic, so I couldn't tell you if this series is worth purchasing or not. Not going to rate the acting, nor the plot nor the setting. If you are a hardcore Stargate fan, SGU might not appeal to you like you might wish it. I've noticed an increase in drama and a decrease in the actual Stargate sci-fi part that I loved of SG-1 and Atlantis. It's still a transition I am willing to make, but check out. The first two episodes, Air pt 1 and Air pt 2, were free when I got them, so if they still are free check them out.
6305428298|3.0|I actually enjoyed the film when I watched it; it was only after reading some of the more critical reviews here that I started to think about it and realize that it didn't entirely work for me.  (Maybe the moral is not to think about films too much, if you just want to enjoy them.)    I think that problem with the film is that it was conceived as a showcase for Jane Horrock's vocal impersonations.  A stage show was built around them, with a story that, according to people who saw it, was much deeper in character development.  Apparently the film's version cut out much of the mother's character, which would make the film more meaningful and believable.     Besides that,I think that the main problem I had with the film was that I didn't much care for the much lauded performance. I did laugh out loud at her \\"Marlene Dietrich\\" but her \\"Judy Garland\\" was sort of creepy and her \\"Marilyn Monroe\\" was pathetic.      So this whole story was constructed around this performance and, at the end of it I had to say \\"Much to do about Nothing.\\"    We find out, at the end, that \\"Little Voice's\\" real name is \\"Laura,\\" hence my reference to \\"Laura Wingfield\\", another pathologically shy heroine with an overbearing cruel mother, in \\"The Glass Menagerie.\\"  Tennesse Williams did it much better!  Laurence Olivier did a star turn as \\"Archie\\" someone, another down-on-his luck British entertainer, in the film, \\"The Entertainer.\\"    Here Michael Caine gives another terrific performance of the same kind of guy.  He almost makes the film worth seeing.    The character of Little Voice is not very believable.  She goes from practically catatonic, rarely speaks, never leaves the house, doesn't make eye contact, etc. to a vibrant happy person helping her new love train his pigeons.  It's a nice thought but really strains credibility.    However, if you just want a feel good film that doesn't make you think too much, this may be just the thing.
B000002LLC|5.0|I first got this when I was 11, and STILL listen to it now (i'm 30). Just to be clear, the songs that this includes from Dick Tracy are (and they are the original songs featured in the movie):     Sooner or Later  More  What Can You Lose?    You may remember that there was a song called \\"Back in Business\\" in the movie, and this was sung by all the dancer/chorus girls but Madonna's version is a totally different song (and more suited for this album.) The song \\"Now i'm Following You\\" is heard in the background of the movie at one point, but not sung by Madonna. (Also, Warren Beatty sings with Madonna on this one.) All of the other songs are original songs inspired by the time era the movie takes place in. I like \\"He's a man,\\" \\"Hanky Panky,\\" and \\"Something to Remember.\\" There are two songs \\"Going Bananas,\\" and \\"Cry Baby,\\" that are fun but may get tiresome if you play them to much. And of course, we all know \\"Vogue.\\" Highly recommended and very underrated!
0316066524|5.0|David Foster Wallace is a genius.  This book rivals all the classics with Wallace's amazing style and language. It may be a big book but it is an amazing read all the way through.  I have never read anything quite as brilliant as this book.
B002VECMA4|2.0|When I discovered a movie was being made about The Men Who Stare at Goats I was excited, until I realized it was a comedic work of fiction.  Thing is, The Men Who Stare at Goats isn't funny.<br /><br />Oh, it's darkly humorous as the author, Jon Ronson, attempts to get to the truth while keeping a straight face.  But it's not funny, and the conclusion Ronson reaches by the end of the book, after tracking the noble origins of a twisted, sadistic form of psychological warfare, is a punch in the face.  So why was it made into a comedy?<br /><br />Fortunately, comedy is too broad a stroke for the movie.  It's actually a gonzo buddy journalism movie, where the actors play everything utterly straight.  The humor is in what isn't said.<br /><br />For example: When Ewan McGregor's journalist character Bob Wilton, he of Obi-Wan fame, asks \\"What's a Jedi?\\" nobody so much as snickers. Unfortunately the audience didn't seem to get it either: only my wife and I were laughing.<br /><br />Wilton is on a mission to prove to his wife that he's more of a man than the one-armed editor who steals her from him.  See?  One armed men are funny!<br /><br />Partnering with Lyn Cassady (George Clooney), a Special Forces psi-ops soldier, the two travel around Iraq on a mysterious mission.  Just about every eccentric Ronson encountered in his book is collapsed into two characters in the film, Cassady and Bill Django (Jeff Bridges), Cassady's mentor.<br /><br />And that's pretty much where The Men Who Stares at Goats loses its way...literally, as the two characters repeatedly get lost in the desert.  Eventually, they end up at a secret base where more than just goat staring takes place.<br /><br />The film is faithful to its source in surprising ways, from the Today show broadcast of Barney music used in torturing prisoners to a picture-for-picture reproduction of the First Earth Battalion manual (here titled the New Earth Army). The problem is that following Ronson/Wilton's journey to its logical conclusion should end with court marshals, public outrage, and an official inquiry.  The strength and weakness of The Men Who Stare at Goats is that it unflinchingly deals with this problem...it's just that the solution is patently ridiculous. The film drives right off the cliff into a wish fulfillment fantasy that saps the strength of the rest of the movie.<br /><br />The film ends with a sucker punch (SPOILER).  Wilton publishes the truth, and instead of outrage, the world just laughs. The moral is that mass media turned the awful true story into a comedy...just like a comedic buddy movie did to a certain book you might have read.<br /><br />Too bleak to be funny, too lighthearted to be serious, The Men Who Stares at Goats ends up as a hot mess of hippy idealism smashed together with modern conspiracy.  It should have been a documentary.c outrage, and an official inquiry.

B001OQCV24|4.0|I Must Say I disagree with a lot of the negative reviews.  I thought this movie served its purpose... The purpose to escape THE REAL BORING WORLD and see something really cool.  This was totally Over the top, yes some of the sequences made me say YEAAAAAA RIGHT but it was cool because I Appreciate the Art Factor, The brilliance in the computer imagery and sequences.. And the fact that you have a moral undertone that says something that is so true about man and what would probably happen if we were to have an end of days. This movie really reflects on how humans treat each other and how an event like this can bring out the worst and the best in us.  This movie was better than I honestly expected, I would have to Say this movie gets props for the best disaster and cgi movie. The acting may not be the greatest but it serves the purpose for the style of movie. I think some people get so caught up in wanting everything to be so serious or have a certain storyline that they forget that movies like this are suppose to be simply an escape from what you may never experience in real life.  They have a lot of disaster movies that had destruction like this, but in my  opinion this was the best that ever did it.  The amount of detail in cgi is simply amazing, My only dissappointment is that they didn't put this movie as a 3D Movie.  I take this movie for what it is.  A Rollercoaster and a fun one to ride at that.
B002HWRZH0|4.0|This movie was great! Can't wait to get the blu-ray to watch it up close in all of it's glory. The casting was perfect and the acting was good. There'll be plenty of extras too to keep me entertained for a while as well. If you want the best Christmas gifts, you gotta get them yourself :-)
B002NULL9E|5.0|Best Buy has the U.S. exclusive on this collection, so don't waste your money on the import. It's the same thing. The 2009 remasters are incredible on this CD. GET IT!
B001GCUNWQ|3.0|This movie is way better in Spanish than in English... My daughter loves these movies so we just have to have it.
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|Jason Mraz is extremely gifted and I really believe he sounds much better live than recorded.  I can never get enough of that voice!!
386521584X|5.0|This collection of photos didn't attract much attention when first published. Some believed race issues were a problem. Don't think so. I graduated from college during this period. The photos then would have been ordinary scenes in black and white during a period when most photos were color.  The collection captures the time nicely. One of the photos is misidentified as to place. Several others have explanations different from my assessment.  It isn't about the narrative and black and white makes the subjects stand out. There is a newspaper stand in one of the photos.  Who is on the cover of Look?
B00006L83N|5.0|I'm very glad I chose this as my first Symphony X album to listen to. Every song is epic and heavy. I will be buying this album for my collection very soon, and it will probably end up being my favourite.
1569242739|5.0|I loooooooooove this book. I'm not much of a sweet eater so when I'd seen their vegan cupcake book I thought this would be a good idea. Though I haven't tried every recipe yet I have to say every one I've tried has been fantastic. I don't know why people freak when they hear something is vegan but yes even those people drool when I mention I've got cupcakes. I've made the margarita, rosewater, peanut butter, chocoate, chocolate with oreo frosting, and vanilla cupcakes to date and I'm always impressed. The ingredients have been easy to find, the instructions easy to follow and the results are yummy! My criteria for a great cookbook!!!
0634022296|5.0|I'm not a professional, and I can't read music. I'm not a great guitarist, either-although I'm a big Beatles fan. But this was the first time I could finally find the right chords for \\"Help!\\", \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", \\"Come Together\\" and many other so-loved hits. I could never imagine that I'd hear my own hands playing \\"Because\\" or even \\"Helter Skelter\\".. It's simple and accurate at the same time. And - the most important of all - it's an easy music book for amateurs, but it's exactly what the title says: the complete Beatles songbook...  Thanks a lot!    P.S. Sorry for my poor English, but I'm just a Greek lady...
0143039504|5.0|I bought this for my wife, and she couldn't put it down until she finished the whole thing.  A must have for any Jane Austen fan.
B000VFGQUC|2.0|Back in the 70's I was a big fan of the many great bands that came out of the UK.  The Who, Bowie, Uriah Heep, Sabbath, and of course Thin Lizzy.  Who can ever forget the killer guitars, Phil's great vocals- did Springsteen copy him, or did he cop Springsteen, lol.  Anyway, this was a great concert to see as recorded from the world famous Rainbow Theater in London England.  I hear that today, the Rainbow is no longer and some church now has taken over the building.<br /><br />I saw Thin Lizzy on the breakthrough \\"Jailbreak\\" tour, and then again on the \\"Bad Reputation\\" tour, when they toured America, so I was looking forward to seeing this dvd.  It opens with Jailbreak and they do a bang up good job to boot.  Philip Lynott's great vocals along with the twin-guitar attack of Brian Robertson and Scott Gorham totally rock.  The drum solo played on a killer double bass Rogers set also rocks.<br /><br />HOWEVER, why did the sound of this dvd sound like it was recorded underwater.  I have a kick ass 6 speaker B&W and Onkyo 150 watt amp.  Why?  The sound on this dvd was muffled and not clear at all.  You can remedy this a bit by turning up the treble, but if so much of this concert was re-dubbed, why is the sound so muddy?<br /><br />So just beware, the sound sucks on this dvd.  Which is a shame, because the performance is great, the video looks good- even the KISS like spinning sign in the background, lol.<br /><br />Worth buying or renting for the true 70's british rock fan.  Just make sure you turn up the treble to 11, as the highs just don't exist on this soundtrack.<br /><br />Long Live British Rock!
