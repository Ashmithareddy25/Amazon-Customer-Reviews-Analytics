B00846REIS|5.0|Great book!  Great read!  Loved the story and the characters.  Definitely would recommend it to others to read.  I can't wait for the last of the trilogy to be released.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I have fallen in love with this book so much so I have read it twice.  The characters are so deep and the author brings out their depth in this book.  The storyline continues from Bard To You.  The sex is so very hot and the passion between the main characters is dynamic.  I loved reading 50 Shades trilogy and this series compares in so many ways and in so many ways it's different.  The story has so much you will not be disappointed.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is a great story complete with action and romance. Percabeth lovers would be happy with this story, seeing as how there are a lot of scenes with just the two of them. The story ends in a dramatic twist and I can't wait for the next book. This is a great book to read for all ages.
0740748475|5.0|All comics should have a collection like this. The product arrived perfectly in my house, and quickly too. I ordered from Brazil, so I was really impressed with the shipping.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|I love love loved this this is my favourite tv show if you like really weird happenings then you must see the fringe series it has everything action packed i truely recommend you to buy this its a series you would watch over and over so you wont be wasting your money on this product.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|Fun and challanging. You can buy in game credits, or earn them for free. So really anyone complaining about in app purchases needs to realize you have to double confirm purchases. And it is not needed for the game.<br /><br />Honestly a lovely cute app that a actually is challenging
B0099G3I96|5.0|I was beginning to think this group would never get back together and put out anymore music.  Don't get me wrong, I've got nothing against Gwen by herself, I just prefer her with the group.  I LOVE this album.  Totally worth the wait! :D
B003G4W49C|5.0|I'm not normally a sci-fi reader, but every so often I'll pick one up that catches my interest and I sure am glad I did that this time. Ender's Game is fantastic. It's a coming of age story with a great mix of humour, poignancy, darkness and hope. At times you forget it even has sci-fi elements.<br /><br />The best thing about it is the characters. It's hard not to get attached to the children in the story. They're so well crafted and are so believable in their struggles. The whole idea of hyper intelligent children being forced to grow up too soon is extremely interesting.<br /><br />I've seen there is a series that tells the same story from Bean's perspective, and I'll certainly be checking that out soon because he was one of my favourite characters.<br /><br />Anyway I can't recommend this book enough, for both sci-fi lovers and fiction lovers in general.
B0090SVDO0|5.0|Playing before a large hometown outdoor crowd, the Doors had to be at the top of their game.  They went over the top on July 5, 1968.  Once Jim Morrison shouts out \\"We Want The World\\" on the very first song the audience knew this is not going to be a greatest hits concert.  Sure they were going give them \\"Light My Fire\\".  In between, the set list had to paced properly so fans in the nose bleed seats wouldn't feel lost.  So on this album the tiresome starts, stops and delays that seem to always be heard on their indoor performances never happen. Finally the whole enchilada of rock, ballads, humor, balenced medleys and pin drop quiet - \\"Texas Radio And The Big Beat\\".  I do like the improved the DVD.  On a regular repeat basis, I'll take the CD.  The music takes a back seat when watching as compared to listening.  Amazing what can happen when the Doors in remixed sound can do when they were having a great night. And yes, they were also very tight in their hungry years as a foursome in musicianship, spoken word, poetry and edge - \\"Hello I Love You\\".  When they finish it off with \\"The End\\", the audience is zapped.  The 71 minutes goes by quickly.  This was a great Doors concert.
0307720950|5.0|Are you interested in the future of small business and manufacturing in the US?  To you want to know what is happening on the cutting edge of design technology?  Do you know what 3-D printing, digital fabrication and the makers?  Then Chris Anderson's introduction titled Makers: The New Industrial Revolution will bring you up short for sure.  Anderson (The Long Tail; Free: How Today's Smartest Businesses Profit by Giving Something for Nothing) is the editor of Wired Magazine who will guide you through the brave new technological world that is pushing us into the future.  He opens with an introduction to the invention revolution and how it is contributing to the new industrial revolution.  He explains how design and manufacturing are changing the face of the economy and  how desktop factories linked to open hardware are driving that revolution.  His description of 3-D printing is worth the price of the book to the unfamiliar.  He clearly introduces computer numerical control, G-code and its importance, and software like CAD and its use.  Those who despair for the US economy and manufacturing there is hope, for Anderson tells how custom batch work can well come home.  Some may find Anderson's approach a bit Pollyannaish, simplistic, or overly optimistic, but there is still much here to  stimulate thinking and inform readers.  This is a good book readily available to the nontechnical type just interested.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I am in love with this game and I have been playing it all the time.......my mom and brothers are starting to get addicted just like me!!!!!!!.......It is cool how you can have all different gagets and jetpacks to use in the game!!!!!
0765316994|4.0|As a Star Trek fan, I have to admit that the title initially pulled me in.  It gave me an instant reference to the subject.  John Scalzi's (Old Man's War; Fuzzy Nation) writing is stellar.  Watch out for the codas, a tear may appear after a fun, upbeat story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this tame is way better then temple run its more for kids but its still fun for terns. I think its way easy to play. the grapghcs are good too.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Batman.  I'm no movie critic nor am i a comic aficionado but in my opinion this is a fantastic movie.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|it's a fun game but seems too easy. I play a lot of hidden object games and like ones that are harder. if 1st time player this is perfect.  fun fun
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This is the first Game of Thrones novel I've read. After watching the first two seasons on HBO I had to find out what happened to all the characters. I couldn't wait for season 3. So I rushed to Amazon to buy this book and I was extremely impressed. By far the best fantasy I've ever read. Hands down.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|A gentle yet entertaining read about a man's walk to post a letter turning into a walk the length of England and a journey of self discovery. I really enjoyed this well-written novel and highly recommend it.
B00913DPW2|5.0|This game is filled with gorgeous settings, tough puzzles, and a spooky atmosphere. It kept me entertained through a full day of sitting inside and waiting for Hurricane Sandy to pass. Some of the puzzles can be of the maddening 'move one lever and all the rest move too' variety, but there is an option to skip many of them if you get too frustrated. Get it while it's free!
B0089IGUKO|5.0|Such an artfully crafted album, they are icons of their time. There is raw emotion and soul  in the lyrics that you rarely see in music these days
0805028846|3.0|Lots of ideas but I was disappointed not to have more examples of real projects.  I would have appreciated templates like the bird on the cover or Santa.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Our whole family really enjoyed this movie. It really makes you think about pigeon holing people without even giving them a chance. Very inspirational.
B008SVFX96|4.0|Great album from a remarkable guitar player. Some of my favorite songs are \\"Every Road Leads Home to You\\", \\"Sugar Daddy\\", and \\"Seven Years Gone\\". I recommend this album if you've liked any of Richie's previous work.
0385344228|4.0|Honestly, writing a review for this book is VERY difficult becuase I do NOT want to spoil it for anyone.  Let's see--if you are in to fairytale or predictable books, pass it up.  If you enjoy great writing that is just the opposite, give this a read.  I really did enjoy it!!  The ONLY reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because I feel that that there could have been a bit more character building for Jacob.  I realize that the narrator is the father so it is all through his eyes, but still, it would have been nice to have seen a confrontation or even a discussion with his son about what happened.  Even if you think your child is innocent, which I would too, I would still have a converstation with him/her about why he/she was being accused.<br /><br />I didn't see the ending coming, which made the book for me :-)
B007KQI1NA|5.0|I have a Panasonic Toughbook with built-in GPS ... bought this for the newer chip and improved accuracy.  It works.  Able to get very acurate GPS signal now, within a few meters I'd guess.  I added a USB extender cable and use this attached to my laptop on my boat, it's much more accurate than the built-in laptop GPS and seems to hold up to the elements just fine.  Good price too.
B00012QM8G|5.0|This movie will move you.  It is a gut wrenching story of not only the Holocaust, but how our money has power.  We have the power to take our money and spend it on ourselves, or we can consciously be more aware of our surroundings and use our money to help others.
B008RZF1UO|4.0|Kamelot comes back with another album with new singer Tommy Karevik.  Tommy is also the lead singer in 7th Wonder.  Being that I loathe Tommy in that band I was expecting a big colossal dirt bomb here.  Tommy writes lyrics on a grade school level while I consider Roy Khan a PH.D. level.  I was not expecting much by way of lyrics.  Tommy shut me up real quick.  I listened to the whole album and lyrics aren't bad. This is a good start with Tommy.  He needs to stop trying to sound like Khan though.  He has big shoes to fill so he needs to have Khan wiped from memory not make us miss him more by imitating him.  They give you what we want here.  Hooks could be a little better.  All in all this is a good album if you are a Kamelot fan. I'm a big Kamelot fan and I'm just being real.  I enjoyed it but they lost one of the things that made them unique.  Lets sit back for the next chapter.  I hope they can only get better from here.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I liked this book.  It was well-written and very poignant.  The story was a bit predictable, but hey, it's a young adult novel.  It is a tear jerker though!
B000SEIDR0|5.0|While I knew some of this information, this book was well written and in depth about the food system in the US. I highly recommend this book to everyone.
B001S86J2Q|5.0|This is my favorite musical of all time. So glad I was able to find it here because I tried looking for it in the stores and wasn't successful, especially at a reasonable price! :) Give 'em hell Rydell! :)
B008673ZAQ|4.0|If u read the first book then u will enjoy this second book. It's very good. Many surprises that I wish can mention on here but I don't want to spoil it for the others. I do wish Sylvia would write more about Gideon's past but maybe that's what she has in store for us when the third book comes out! Yes folks a third book! Love it!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|It kept me spellbound.  The characters were all so interesting. It made me want to be on the family's side. It gave me such strong feelings.
B00913DPW2|5.0|its now free and its such a great game.But when I was downloading it it has so much detail that it took forever! THE GRAPHICS ARE SCARY AND AWESOME!!!
B005UBNKWO|5.0|This CPU is excellent! It can be easily overclock at 4Ghz...and more!<br />If you need a good CPU, this is a good choice!<br />My recommendation!

B000SEHJGQ|3.0|This book is about Hanks early years and his miserable upbringing.<br />This brings a new light to Hank but you find out he is even more unlikeable in his youth.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I have no complaints!<br /><br />I Love the product! With a flip of a button you go into surround sound.<br />2 hour full charging time for 10 hour battery life, alert for low battery, and able to use when charging.<br />fun voice morphing, light weight comfortable head piece, the fact that its wireless is awesome,<br />easy access volume control on ear as well as mute button too and or flip up mic to mute. Not only does the mic flip up out of way when needed, it bends in as well.
B007FIY3VW|5.0|the shallow people who stated the app opens documents incorrectly, you should know that only three document types are supported. theese are as follows:<br />Exensions of .docx .pptx .xlsx<br />one person said xlsx did not work, it was probably in a non supported font.
0345803493|5.0|Must be a fan of this book, but it's great, love it!<br />Can't wait to read book 2 & 3
B000OIZUW6|5.0|This book contains information which ALL a Americans should learn and understand.This one man created his own legend in World War I, and earned a fortune following the war. His knowledge of intelligence gathering and its uses was, in a very large part,responsible for helping the allies to defeat Hitler's fascism. As one of many Canadians, his help in providing training for U.S. intelligence gathering and use, led to the O.S.S., and C.I.A.. The United States, and indeed the world,owes this man an enormous thank you! It is of considerable note that over 20,000 Canadian women and men were a part of the JOINT American/British intelligence operation operating out of New York city, with much of the field training taking place near Toronto.

B008OOYALE|3.0|Runs smoother on iPod constantly force closes on Android and # of goals are slim in comparison to iPod. Both versions should be worked on and updated equally. I play on both of my devices and the differences are a nuisance and unfair. For instance on the iPod  it runs smoothly  but the prices to clear foliage ad to feed the new white dragons is ridiculous. On my Droid Bionic I get nothing but force closes and issues yet the prices for the same things are more reasonable. If you are going to offer an application on multiple operation systems it should bee updated and set up equally top be fair.<br /><br />I am very unhappy with customer service, I purchased a gold package and it did not download into the game. I've  written on three occasions and get an automated response to wait 1-2 business days, uninstall and reinstall and them write back if gold still doors not download that's was a week shop I've sent my receipt 3 times now. That's would NEVER happen on iPod.<br /><br />Also this is a free game with the option for in app purchases which I have purchased gold on a few occasions to assist with game play but I will say the program needs to put a safety feature into effect to prevent unintentional purchases. For example  &quot;are you sure button&quot; once you have clicked purchase something. I have made numerous unintentional purchases and customer service will not even consider reimbursing or restitution. Which is bad for business.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I must admit that I purchased this novel based largely on the hype surrounding it. That, and the fact that I wanted an \\"easy\\" read. On the second point, it definitely delivered. I am a man, but I would like to think that I am in touch with my feminine side. Sadly, androgyny alone couldn't turn the words of this novel into anything I would consider prose. The one redeeming quality I could name (... the reason why I gave this work two stars and not one) is that it gave a unique perspective into the mind of a 21st-century woman. Having said this, I now understand the appeal that daytime soap operas have to the fairer sex. If this is what the modern-day literary consumer is lauding as a must have, then I am in mourning at the death of appreciation for the written word. If you want romance, try Gabriel Garcia Marquez. If you want shock value, try Nabokov or DH Lawrence. If you just feel compelled to explore the world of BDSM, give the Marquis de Sade a go. Any one of these writers would be able to give Ms James a lesson or two in how to write eloquently, without the need to over-use adjectives and employ cliched metaphors. All in all, I am left very much underwhelmed. Luckily for Ms James, 40 million people might disagree with me.<br /><br />ADDENDUM: It seems that the redeeming quality I so desperately sought was, in fact, false. I have therefore downgraded my initial assessment accordingly. In my own defence, I really wanted to find a raison d'etre for this book but, as I noted, I am a man, and like so many others of my sex, I too would love to know a little more about how women tick.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Although this is a great movie..... The 3d was not well done. I have over 25 3d blu rays and so far only two make me dizzy and just does not look right! This one and the darkest hour. They need to get whoever did the 3d on marvel movies to do it on this movie. Should have just bought the 2d blu ray instead...

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Enjoyed this book along with the previous 2 books of the series. Author has a talented imagination that gives to  enjoyable reading.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have quite a few solitaire games but this is the best. I guess I can stop searching. I like that you can replay a game that is winnable if you didnt win, I like the whole setup and numerous options that are given. Try this one out!
1932735410|5.0|Good well written book. Information has been presented in a very structured way. I studied for the PMP certification. Not difficult to follow. Questions at the end of each chapter are very helpful. But I will recommend spending time on PMBOK guide, understand input, output and tools for each process. Especially focus on Tools and outputs. Once you complete PMBOK then focus on problems in this book. .
B0088LU3P0|5.0|Fantastic season finale. Can't wait for next year. Feels like real people with real issues and real emotions. Great acting, especially Jon Hamm & tv-wife Megan.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|It's so much repeating the old stuff, a few new things. If you got extra time, read it just to finish the trilogy. Very poor written. It seems that author is running out of words and keeps repeating his old sentences over and over.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It took me a couple.of days to read the Wool Omnibus.  It is a most perfect scifi/fantasy read.  I will wait impatiently for the next installment.

B005IZLPMY|5.0|Great movie! Can't go wrong with Blue-ray, DVD, & Digital Copy! 3 for the price of 1. Watch it on your PS3/Blue-ray player. On your DVD player. Or on your computer/ ipad, iPhone, ect.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|For all the die hard HIMYM fans, you have to get the latest DVD season release. All the hilarity you have come to love, plus a few bonus features to make it sweeter! Don't be the blitz and miss out on something awesome - get it!!
0316228532|2.0|I had high expectations that this book would have a better and more interesting story line. However- I just never felt \\"drawn\\" in. I expected a better story line than this book provided. I don't see this being a best seller.
B00943SQCI|5.0|I love the movie, the story, and everything about it.I also love the ability to choose how to watch it either with my Kindle or my computer.
B007SAKU14|5.0|While most people would probably pick the iconic Parklife as the peak of Blur's career, I believe that The Great Escape (TGE) is their masterpiece. While at the time its artistic value was partially obscured by the Oasis vs Blur nonsense, if you listen to it again you will re-discover one of the best albums of all time. Now the focus has shifted from the then singles, wonderful as they were (Country House, Universal, Stereotypes, Charmless Man) to two of Blur's best songs: Best Days, and the amazing He Thought of Cars. Epic in their simplicity, uniting in their feeling of isolation, triumphant in their self-deprecation. And everything else here is almost equally strong!<br /><br />An amazing album, the peak of a great band, and a wonderful reissue in this 2-CD box. The extras are extras: all the b-sides of their singles, some nice postcards and photos. They are an excuse to get this CD again, but let's face it you will only listen to the second CD a couple of times. But the first CD, the proper release of TGE is more than worth the price of re-admission. Get it again, and love it again.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Being 35, I feel that I am a little out of the demographic age range for Taylor's \\"expected\\" audience.  I feel that her songwriting allows women of different age brackets to relate to her experiences; it is surprisingly comforting to know that someone else has had the same things happen while in romantic relationships.<br /><br />My favorite album prior to this one was \\"Fearless.\\"  It was a mix of happy-go-lucky to mysterious, to sad tunes and I feel that \\"Red\\" mimics that tone, but with an angry twist!  Her passion is evident and I greatly admire how she wears her heart on her sleeve with no apparent hesitation.<br /><br />Although some of the high notes are a little sharp, her songwriting is what brings me back to her albums time and time again.  Over the years, I have listened to many artists and tracks but I find that hers are the only ones that I can listen to, over and over again.<br /><br />Definitely recommended, no matter what age you are!  :)
B009POCFTG|5.0|Few films contain such a palpable mix of dark comedy and brutality as William Friedkin's Killer Joe. The film reunites Friedkin with writer Tracy Letts, who last worked together on 2006's Bug. That film was a memorable little oddity that polarized audiences. If you have the stomach for it, Killer Joe is the superior film. For Friedkin, whose career was built on successes he had decades ago, it's a roaring comeback. For the star Matthew McConaughey, it's a career renaissance. In the last year, after serving time as the go-to guy for romantic comedies, McConaughey has begun taking on more daring roles and this is his most daring yet. It's also his best performance.<br /><br />Most of Killer Joe takes place in a trailer park somewhere in Texas, home of the Smiths, a family of rednecks for whom the word `philistine' was almost certainly invented. Chris Smith (Emile Hirsch) is a drug dealer whose mother has stolen his stash and left him desperately in debt to some guys who will kill him unless he comes up with $6000. Learning of his mother's $50,000 life insurance policy for which his sister Dottie (Juno Temple) is the beneficiary, Chris approaches his father Ansel (Thomas Haden Church) about the prospect of having his mother killed. Not only would this solve Chris' problem, but it could lead to a big payday for Dottie, Ansel and his current wife Sharla (Gina Gershon). The person to do it is Joe Cooper (McConaughey), a Dallas detective who moonlights as a hitman. After they meet with Joe, he demands $25,000 in advance that Chris and Ansel are unable to provide. But Joe is willing to negotiate and will accept a retainer; Dottie.<br /><br />There's no telling who is working against each other in the Smiths family. Although they lack any semblance of sagacity, their ignorance spawns both humor and horror. There's a sardonic glee in the way their story unfolds; we never know the length of stupidity they're capable of. The only redeeming character is Dottie, who seems mentally slower than her family (quite a feat), yet innocently more aware.<br /><br />Letts' script is an adaption of his own play yet, unlike many stage adaptations, there's never a sense that this was made for the stage. One reason is Friedkin's fearless direction and the other is Caleb Deschanel's unflinching cinematography. Killer Joe was initially rated NC-17 (eventually surrendered) and it's hard to recall a film that so deserves it. This is a violent, bloody, misogynistic, and often sadistic film that basks in its lurid tendency to push the envelope. However, there's much more to Killer Joe than mere shock value. It's self-aware and crackles with great dialogue and memorable performances from everyone involved. It jumps right into the plot but slow burns with quiet intensity before erupting into total chaos, fueled mostly by McConaughey's menacing and frightening performance.<br /><br />Before becoming a romantic-comedy heartthrob McConaughey appeared in Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation and for all that film's shortcomings, he did an exceptional job playing crazy. Even with that performance on his resumé, who could've foretold McConaughey could deliver such a memorable performance that allows him to exploit his natural charisma and charm to play completely against type and make Joe Cooper's ferocity and stark brutality all the more shocking? The performance is so unconventional and horrifying that it won't lead him to an Oscar, but few will argue what an Oscar-caliber performance this is. The other stand-out is Church, playing a character so stupid it takes the right kind of actor to keep it from bubbling over the top. Church's comically silly facial hair and his gift for deadpan make Ansel the comic relief of the film, but he keeps the character from seeming contrived or false within the film's context. He's a gifted actor who never fails to please and surprise.<br /><br />The conclusion of Killer Joe features a long scene involving McConaughey, Church, Gershon, and a chicken leg that stands out as one of the most nail-bitingly intense scenes of any film this year. It's hard to anticipate a scene more startling or suspenseful. Here McConaughey reaches deep into his acting range to show the depths of Killer Joe's (both the movie and character) depravity; this is the moment where he totally sheds the rom-com image. If the Academy were more willing to award edgy, brave performances, this moment would almost certainly win him an Oscar. It's a scene that bristles with energy and no matter how chaotic and shocking it becomes, you can't look away.<br /><br />Killer Joe is a film that gets in your head and stays there. It's a shocking and powerful film that makes a devastating impact. It's certainly entertaining, but make no mistake, it's not for the faint of heart and will disgust and revolt many an audience member. It's one of the most disturbing films of 2012. It's also one of the best.<br /><br />GRADE: A-
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app my teacher lets me use it and it is very beneficial and it helps me a lot I usually don't like math, but I like this app. :3
0375842209|1.0|I agree with all the rest of the one star reviews. Because it was chosen as a book for my book club to read, I tried it and after 200 pages or so, decided not to finish it. I thought the writing was aimed for the young adult, unsophisticated readers...about an 8th grade level, and for those of the population who are not very familiar with WW2. I just don't see all the hype...I've read so many novels that are superior and far more interesting. This is a book that someone who likes the Harry Potter series may enjoy...I guess. I like more realistic writing with more depth. I hope our next book club selection is better!
B009KHDT0C|1.0|The previews for this movie were comedic however there was nothing funny about this morbid tale.  Would not recommend nor watch again.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|excellent quality dvd and shipped faster than what was estimated!  Definetely worth the while and also a great movie too! If you havent seen it or dont own it get it now!!
1936608898|5.0|We have been eating \\"Paleo\\" for 2 years, but I still find this book a great read and refresher on why we eat the way we do. I have purchased it for friends and family as well. It's science-y but easy to read. Broken up nicely so that you don't have to read cover to cover. Not preachy, just good hard facts with a little bit of humor. If I could I'd walk around with a button of the book that says \\"if you care about your health, read this book.\\"

B005LW5J9O|5.0|This was an excellently written telling of the story of a philosophical poem by Lucretius, its forsaking, refinding, and the influence the Epicurean poem had on the development of the Renaissance and modernity.  The level of scholarship and detail in this book is impressive and Greenblatt paints a vivid and thrilling picture of a philosophical alternative to many mainstream views and puts this picture into both a modern and historical context.  Truly masterful!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|very fun!  just difficult enough to keep me interested.  I like how it builds you into the harder levels.  very easy in the beginning.  highly recommend if you like brainteasers and a bit of a challenge.

1455527475|5.0|In \\"Why I Left Goldman Sachs,\\" Greg Smith tells an honest account of his life while at the firm. He shares his own unique experience beginning from the earliest days at the firm as an intern and leads the reader through personal anecdotes that shed light on his decision to ultimately leave Goldman Sachs.<br /><br />Not only will a reader gain a new understanding for the inner-workings and conflicts of interest on Wall Street, but they'll also learn a lot about the man and motivation behind decisions. Greg Smith shares a great deal about his upbringing, basic principles, moral/ethical beliefs, and  general perceptions of Wall Street. Smith does a good job of communicating his thoughts clearly (which I think is especially hard given the complexity of the industry).<br /><br />The book is also entertaining; Smith will often drop an allusion to TV sitcoms like \\"Who's the Boss\\" or \\"Miami Vice\\" which keeps the tone light-hearted and relatable.<br /><br />After reading the book, you'll recognize that Smith is a man who has strong character, stands up for what he believes in, and wants to work on correcting a broken system that impacts all of us.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|The first two books of Suzanne Collins' trilogy - Hunger Games and Catching Fire - were some of my favorite reading in a long while.  Mockingjay - the third book in the trilogy - I had issues with.  But to get back to HUNGER GAMES, the movie - great adaptation of the novel, one of the best adaptations I've seen.<br /><br />Was every detail there?  No.  Not possible in a movie that runs 142 minutes.  But the details that were there were true to the book.<br /><br />Panem (the parts we see) and the Capitol are portrayed very well.  I felt like I was really seeing the poverty-stricken districts, such as District #12, where the main characters (Katniss and Peeta) come from.  And the contrast between the districts and the luxurious Capitol is striking, just as in the book.<br /><br />Casting was spot on.  Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen is perfect in the role.  Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark is great, although I thought he was a bit more macho in the movie than the novel version.  Liam Hemsworth as Gale Hawthorne does a good job, although we don't see him much in this part one movie. I didn't think I was going to like Woody Harrelson as Haymitch Abernathy but he surprised me and I thought he did a spectacular job.<br /><br />Tyranny, oppression, the haves and the have-nots - all are seen in this movie of a dystopian future. Do yourself a favor and watch it.<br /><br />NOTE:  This is a movie about a death match between 24 young participants.  So, yes, there is violence in this movie.  Be forewarned and reconsider allowing younger children to see it.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|This is one amazing album. Stone Sour has done it again with probably their best one yet. Just do yourself a favor and spend the money and get this one. Worth it for sure
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I am so happy with this app. It's ability to be used and accessed from multiple devices is awesome. If I have my Kindle Fire, it's there, or if I only have a phone I see all my work. Our whole ministry team uses this app, and we are currently the 9th fastest growing church in America... if our pastor recommends it, you can believe it's good! =)
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I bought the movies for my 10 year old daughter. She had already finished reading the book series. The DVD arrived sooner than I had expected. This movie has become my daughter's favorite now. She has watched it again and again, alone and with friends. It's a great price for the value and use!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this game.All you have to do is play mini games and work your way up until you  get to finish all the games. I rate it a 5 star game!
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I found Linkin Park late in life - in my forties,to be exact. My first CD was Minutes to Midnight and I enjoyed it thoroughly, much to the chagrin of my then-teenage son. Living Things is their latest installment - and I haven't missed any yet! They seem to be moving away from the rap and more into rock, and I can say that I find the changes in their style through the years enjoyable. I played this album on my daily commute for a week solid after I first bought it - and since then I play it straight through at least once a month and never fail to sing along when any track comes up on the Shuffle setting on my iPhone. Love it!
B008MM9630|5.0|In the English language, the word like has a very flexible range of uses, ranging from conventional to non-standard. It can be used as a noun, verb, adverb, adjective, preposition, particle, conjunction, hedge, interjection, and quotative.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game ever. I say that you should get the game. Why?Because it gets you so entertain that you leave your parents alone.That's is why you should get this game.  Ashley Todd
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game been playing it on my phone but am disappointed that I have to start over cant sign in and bring my score over.
143911000X|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my brother-in-law because he was a fan of How I Met Your Mother.  When I got the book I read a good chunk of it before wrapping it for him.  At the restaurant that we celebrated his birthday, after he opened all his presents he went back and grabbed the book and read it, sharing most of the pages with my sister.  It is a quick, but entertaining read, and a good gift for any HIMYM fan!  As my sister said, my brother-in-law is not really a reader, but he read the book in one day :-)  Definitely recommended
B008XBCJ34|2.0|I bought the original theatrical release blu-ray, then the 5 disc extended set..<br />I don't care about the extras because I already have them on the set, but now, after buying a new 3DTV and Blu-Ray player just for this, it's not the extended version?<br />Sorry Fox.. Perhaps in a few more years, when you release the good version.<br /><br />Also about comments regarding things \\"coming out of the screen\\"  That's not supposed to happen with this film.. It's designed to appear as if you're looking though a window at the world in the movie, not having it come into your room..  Stuff jumping out of the screen at you is a sign of bad 3D..
B003E8P9G0|4.0|This is a heart pumping book for adventure lovers out there. Loved his determination to...well read the book to find out what I'm talking about

B00138KE2C|5.0|If you want to get a softer side of Dave's musical genius, don't miss this one. Several greats treated creatively for the intimate setting, yet unmistakably foo. Get it and you won't regret it.
B0087HT36U|4.0|I like this one alot on the pc and iOS.  Really hoping that the devs decide to update this version soon.
B009KHCT94|4.0|Like others have said, this isn't an academy award winner. It is however a lot of fun. It made us laugh...that's all we asked from it!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The first book of Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy I did not care for, but the other two, I really liked and it had nothing to do with the kinky sex; it had an actual story line. I love their email dialog; it was so cute to see their interaction. The story of what made him tick, was excting, I couldn't wait to continue reading. First book took me forever to read; I give it 3 stars, books two & three, I give them each five stars.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|This is an opportunistic film, based on a weak script, bad casting and mediocre directing. The director counts on (extraordinary) visual effects to bail him out almost as if blinding the viewer by cool tricks would mask the many internal inconsistencies within the plot. I was unable to relate to any of the actors, which was intensely dissatisfying -  the movie lacked, for the lack of a better word, humaneness. The characters were unidimensional, without an inner life as well as unconvincing (especially the scientists). When the best act is provided by the robot well then the director has a problem.  I count this one as a \\"miss\\".
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I TITLED THIS FEARLESS BECAUSE TAYLOR STEPPED OUT OF HER SAFELY ZONE AND WHILE SHE DIDN'T HIT A HOME RUN THIS CD DID NOT FALL FLAT EITHER, FAR FROM IT. Definitely, I will begin by saying Fearless and Speak Now are far better cd's than Red.  But that being said, we are still talking about a remarkable artist and Red is still a true accomplishment. At first, I was flipping frantically from song to song wondering where did Taylor go?!  But after my initial breakdown I listened carefully to this cd and I give it five stars on its on merit apart from anything else.  I think the best cd's like Fearless and Speak Now are the type that you don't need to get used to; that you know from the first second you hear it, it's amazing.  With Red, every listen gets better; songs are discovered that are even brilliant.  I think Sad Beautiful Tragic is one of the best and most haunting love songs I ever heard.  I love The Lucky One and it's insurmountable message not so much for famous people like Taylor Swift who has kept a level head all her life but more like Kurt Cobain or Janis Joplin or in recent times Britney Spears or Amy Winehouse.  Sometimes the lucky ones are those that break away from a fame that is destroying them.  Anyway, I look forward to finding new depths every time I listen to this CD over again; and I also look forward to Taylor's next CD which I hope will return back to her roots.
1423140605|5.0|The book was as expected awesome. There were so many twists and turns, that it was like being on a rollercoaster. Except no nausea. I can't wait to see the next. It will definitely be a huge hit not to mention best seller.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Just like real life! Push those coins down the shoot of time! More fun than a boat load of monkeys.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Marvel had a lot of foresight to slowly build up each character in their own respective movie and it pays off here, in an amazing comic book movie experience.  Funny moments, great action, and all around a joy to watch.  Looking forward to Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Too bad DC and Warner Brothers can't get their act together and produce the same high quality films for their superheros.(minus the Batman movies, and possibly even Man of Steel).
B008C1O8CA|2.0|I am a huge Green Day fan so I have been waiting a while for the release date. I waited to write this review hoping this album would grow on me. It has not. Green Day has evolved since 1039 and Kerplunk, but this album doesn't do them justice. I hope the next 2 are better. I will still go see them, in fact I already got my tickets, but I will be waiting for them to play their older stuff.
B00992CF6W|5.0|ok what I'm thinking like others is that minecraft is awesome but its missing somethings if you like creating stuff awesome get it but you guy's got to put in the red stone dust. the bucket. and the minecart and you guys would get way more downloads.<br />p.s. I play on the amazon kindle fire
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This the second in the series and to me the most enjoyable.  I could not put it down.  Great reading.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|Not a great movie and certainly not a good 3d movie either. Green Hornet wasn't that great of a movie but an excellent 3d movie.
B008OOYALE|1.0|This game is designed to drain your wallet!! It has everything you need to have fun if you are willing to spend AT LEAST $100 a month. The economy is ridiculously upside down requiring the player to spend hundreds of thousands of &quot;coins&quot; to expand slightly. When it comes to making new dragons you will get the same &quot;offspring&quot; 99/100 times with time delays varying from 1 hour to 2 days. It is painfully obvious that the game is less about having fun &amp; more about trying to get the player to spend real money.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I liked the book things they fight over is real life.  You don't get that in most books or Tv.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I bouht this DVD for my neice and I have to admit that I realy liked this movie too. We both watched the full movie and neither of us wanted it to end. If you are into Disney animation movies than you need to view this one too.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|This is a good movie if you are old enough to appreciate it. I would say you would need to be *AT LEAST* 50 years old to truly get it.
B0052SF6CM|4.0|Scottish performer/songwriter/producer Calvin Harris' new Dance music CD reads like a greatest hits CD. 6 of the tracks on the album have made the top 2 in the UK; \\"Bounce\\" (featuring Kelis), \\"Feel So Close\\" (featuring Harris' more confident-sounding vocals), the Trance \\"Let's Go\\" (featuring Ne-Yo who sounds great on the track), \\"We'll Be Coming Back\\" (featuring Example), the worldwide smash \\"We Found Love\\" (featuring Rihanna), and the sublime \\"Sweet Nothing\\" (featuring Florence Welch of The Machine fame), the latter two hit number 1. All are catchy and guaranteed to get you moving on the dance floor, while managing some sonic variety unlike say David Guetta tracks.<br /><br />The Dub Step \\"Iron\\" features Nicky Romero, \\"I Need Your Love\\" features Ellie Goulding and appeared as a bonus track on her \\"Halcyon\\" CD), the ravey \\"Drinking From The Bottle\\" features Dizzee rascal (who name checking icons Cyndi Lauper and Blondie, jokes about Kim Kardashian, and declares \\"Forget about tomorrow... tonight, we're drinking from the bottle!\\"), the skeletal \\"Here 2 China\\" features Dillon Francis and Dizzee Rascal (and some earth quaking bass and beats), and \\"Thinking About You\\" features Ayah Marar (and some stabbing synths). The other songs are brief instrumentals with whiffs of Daft Punk, with the slow paced dreamy \\"Green Valley\\", and the upbeat pair of \\"School\\" and \\"Awooga\\" standouts.<br /><br />With lyrics rarely straying from love, or having a good time, this one is aimed squarely at the dance floor with fists pumping in the air.
B00913DPW2|2.0|I appreciate difficult games however not telling people what to do or even hint at it is just silly and a waste of time. I don't mind having to figure out how to accomplish a task but to have to sit there and figure out what the task even is, is ridiculous. Really thought tbis would be a good game but once again I get the hint of a bunch of fake 5 star reviews. Glad it was free.
B00884GR0W|5.0|I love this game!my brow first recommended it to me and I didn't really want to spend $5 but it was definitely worth it. Ive never played Minecraft but from what Ive heard you have to constantly eat and drink and you pay $20 I think every month. with block story, you pay one price, $5, don't have to eat and drink constantly to stay alive, and there are constantly updates that (that dont cost anything extra)make the game better and better. Another good thing is you don't need wifi wifi to play which really helps if you don't working Internet access at your house. Also, with the grammer thing, does it really matter? I mean really. Did you buy the game to get a spelling lesson or to just take some boredness out of your life? Anyway all of us do it at some pointnin emails or texts so it doesn't really matter. Overall its a great game and definitely not a waste of money.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|I received the USB phonograph player in great time. And it has been meeting my expectations ever since.  Learning to use the recording software has been more of a challenge but it is working as well
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great basic calculator app. Exactly what you would expect. Perfect for everyday applcations as long as you're not in need of any advanced functions.
B009CF3P7E|4.0|I would have given this 5 stars as I did enjoy watching it. But really?!? Pipes and I beams in a starship? Did the special effects budget run a little low or what?
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm totally addicted to this game. I cant walk away from it. I'm such a temple run nerd. Best game ever invented.

B009KHBDUU|3.0|Campy, cute movie made from old soap opera. Enjoyable to watch. Funny one-liners. Having grown up eatching the original I enjoyed watching the movie but wouldn't buy the DVD. Once was enough.
B0063B2BNE|5.0|This series was easy to watch  (no interruption).  Enjoyed the new plot!  Was able to catch up on the series without purchasing the DVD.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Don't ever start this game if you are not committed to becoming an AB addict! It was recommended to me, so I thought I would see what all the hype was about. I saw. VERY fun! The ads are bothersome, but don't really affect game play. Enjoy!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome I love it the best game ever is this and maybe the second best is mine craft
B006AX6ONI|5.0|I enjoyed the insights into creating a business that Mark Cuban provides in this book.  I did not want to stop reading it and that says something about its content and the style of writing used.  Good as an interesting autobiographical work and also as a reference for business people to learn and apply.  I especially liked the candid manor in which Mark discussed his early years couch surfing and finding his way in the world.  5 stars is a big endorsement but you can be clear that I enjoyed reading this book immensely.
1439152799|4.0|I am a Kate Morton fan. I have read and enjoyed all of her book and especially LOVED The Forgotten Garden. To me, this book fell a little short. The first third of the book was very slow and nothing really happened. I know she was trying to create a background for the story but it was too long and with too many unnecessary details. The second third is where the events and the story starts to take shape and the last third was very enjoyable with lots of details and twists. The last third is what made me give the book 4 stars.<br /><br />The following MIGHT contain SPOILERS for some:<br /><br />The book reminded me of [[ASIN:B004H8GLXQ The Thirteenth Tale: A Novel]]. It has similar themes and plots. Some of the shared themes: twins and their relationships - fires - Old woman telling a story - young publisher/writer gets answers to the mystery - mystery related to a certain book/story. The last parts of the book had even the similar creepiness.<br /><br />End of Spoilers<br /><br />The twist at the end was not that shocking to me. At least not like the shocking twists in [[ASIN:1416550550 The Forgotten Garden: A Novel]] and [[ASIN:1416550534 The House at Riverton: A Novel]]. The twists in those books blew me away. Here, not so much!<br /><br />Over all, I enjoyed reading the novel and would tell readers who were put off by this book to not give up on her other books. They are worth reading!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This is a good game, taking the match three formula and going a bit further. However, there is no &quot;payoff&quot; at the end, which is disappointing.
B004T4LUPW|4.0|Calengoo has been very helpful to me and has succeeded where other apps have not. The main thing that I like about this particular app is that you have the ability to customize a reminder for yourself.
0316227706|5.0|We love animals, and my daughter has 2 dogs, so this will be a gift for her. She's going to love it just as I did leafing thru the pages. The author/photographer caught some unbelievably funny pictures. If you love dogs, you will love this!
B0094KF4WG|4.0|Interesting to read the inside story of the attack. Any misconceptions created in press reports are dealt with and you are left with the impression that it was an extremely well planned and executed mission
B007THA4FI|1.0|Were it not for the author's name, I doubt that it would have been published in the USA.  I am forcing myself to finish it; but I don't know why.  The book is a \\"soap opera\\" of the dullest sort.  Maybe it will appeal to some females who like such things.<br /><br />It is a dreary story about mostly dreary and unloveable characters, involved in  dreary small town politics in a dreary English town.  The nearest thing to a hero is dead almost immediately (a dreary natural death); and the rest of the tome is devoted to the fall-out from that death.<br /><br />The \\"Harry Potter Septology\\" demonstrated Ms. Rowling's magnificent talent, \\"CV\\" is a heartbreaking, disillusioning hack.  I bought the book on her name and my adoration for her demonstrated talent.  In the future I will want to see a sample first, alas!
B000P0J0A6|5.0|We really enjoyed the movie. We watched it over an over. I bought a set for my grandson Logan. For Christmas. Can't wait to give it to him
B003L77G8I|5.0|Great set of videos.  I am enjoying the slowly, so that the enjoyment lasts for as long as possible.  Good joy and much entertainment.  Thanks
0385535147|2.0|I stopped reading John Grisham two books back because his books became shallow and predictable. I bought this book because it was discounted and I wanted an easy read for a rainy afternoon. It is an easy read. The plot is predictable, the characters are shallow, and the ending unremarkable. I skipped parts of the middle. The 1st third was the most interesting. I thought that the main character would redeem himself and do something wonderful for his son or other inmates, but no he simply walks away. He is not a stand up character, so not particularly relate-able. The author does explain that this book is pure fiction so the reader is supposed to suspend disbelief at unrealistic events. The whole FBI story was unrealistic. I kept waiting for them to screw the main character to the wall which is more their modis operendi but not in this story. If you want a quick read that doesn't engage you emotionally or intellectually and you can get this book cheap, then read it. It is my last Grisham book cheap or not. So many better stories to read.
159420411X|4.0|This is a well-written book about the challenges associated with making predictions. But nearly all the ideas in it were ones I was already familiar with.<br /><br />I agree with nearly everything the book says. But I'll mention two small disagreements.<br /><br />He claims that 0 and 100 percent are probabilities. Many Bayesians dispute that. He has a logically consistent interpretation and doesn't claim it's ever sane to believe something with probability 0 or 100 percent, so I'm not sure the difference matters, but rejecting the idea that those can represent probabilities seems at least like a simpler way of avoiding mistakes.<br /><br />When pointing out the weak correlation between calorie consumption and obesity, he says he doesn't know of an \\"obesity skeptics\\" community that would be comparable to the global warming skeptics. In fact there are people (e.g. Dave Asprey) who deny that excess calories cause obesity (with better tests than the global warming skeptics).<br /><br />It would make sense to read this book instead of alternatives such as Moneyball and Tetlock's Expert Political Judgment, but if you've been reading books in this area already this one won't seem important.
B00913DPW2|2.0|On my Droid bionic, the music was choppy and eventually just got annoying. Once I was through the front door, it locked up &amp; wouldn't let me back out of the hallway. Up to that point, I was enjoying the well-made interface and smooth flow of finding clues. I hope it doesn't keep locking up... :-(
B006LSZECO|5.0|You won't believe this story that gets crazier and crazier as you turn each page!  And you won't be able to put it down until the end and even then you won't want to!

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Definitely the best of hidden object games I have seen come down to mobile from BFG. Looking forward to the sequel.
B007R108WA|1.0|Not worth your time commitment. It is a movie that tries to do what the protagonist's final product tries to do - beguile your senses into believing that you're actually feeling something, when all you're actually experiencing is malodorous murder.
0762439009|4.0|My boyfriend's favorite movie is The Big Lebowski, and this was a great gift for him. He still uses the mousepad all the time, and the mug is great. He doesn't put patches on anything, but it was cute that it was included. Overall, a great gift someone who loves the movie!!

B008673ZAQ|4.0|I won my copy of this book, and I had never read anything by this author.  Well, that is about to change.  I really liked this book.  Gideon and Eva are wonderful characters and I really want to see how their relationship evolves.  Wow, and the smoking hot sex scenes, so much better than Fifty Shades.  I highly recommend this book.  Cannot await for the next one.
B008B0QH5S|5.0|Another disc totally different from all the others.  That's what I love about these guys. They're never afraid to do something new and different. That they have survived and thrived for 2 decades, speaks volumes for their work.
1401216676|4.0|Just as Batman: Year One is considered to be the 'official' origin of Batman, The Killing Joke has become the definitive origin of the Joker. Cited as one of the influential novels read by the late Heath Ledger as inspiration for his role as the Joker in The Dark Knight this is a pretty solid story.<br /><br />The writing as you would probably expect is brilliant and did nothing short of solidify Alan Moore's place in comic book history.The art is great and very recognized as archetype Brian Bolland. The short novel is very dark and twisted, things you will never forget, and created one event in DC history that changed the Bat-universe forever.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read! Great choice!<br />You will love! Hunger games really rock!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|amazing the best game I have ever played<br />I love. it. bla. bla. bla. bla bla bla bla bla bla
B002N5N4M6|5.0|What can I say. Best comedy on T.V. in a long time. Sheldon's straight faced zings....all of it. They must have fun shooting those scenes.  They chose the perfect cast for the parts, even the girlfriends they have since added are right for their parts.
B008LY9AWG|4.0|I'm a big Harry Bosch fan. Those novels are complex and enthralling. it was fun to read something entirely different from Mr. Connelly. These were short, hard-hitting stories that smacked me around a little bit with their abruptness. Right when I knew what was coming in one of them...I didn't!
B008BM9L72|2.0|The books are really badly written, especially the first one- 'Fifty shades of Grey'. The storyline is weak and the sex scenes are not erotic at all. I would definitely not recommend anyone wasting their money on these books as I unfortunately did.
B0088EDMMS|5.0|The first time I saw Hocus Pocus,  I was just a little kid (maybe five or six) and my sister and I saw it somewhere.  We watched a VHS copy, because I grew up in the Dark Ages, and loved the movie.  There was music, adventure, a talking cat, and all sorts of craziness.  But then, I didn't know the movie's name.  I didn't know anyone else who'd seen it.  I thought my sister and I had dreamed it up and it didn't actually exist.  Then we saw it at my cousin's house.  It existed.<br /><br />I absolutely, unequivocally love this movie.  I'm glad that it's found a cult audience despite bombing in theaters.  And yes, it has stood the test of time.  I recently showed it to my niece and nephew and they enjoyed it.  My niece, who is almost five, rarely sits still for an entire episode of Spongebob Squarepants, which is only twenty-five minutes long and her favorite television show.  Hocus Pocus held her spellbound for an hour and a half.  (Okay, her attention did waver a little until the witches showed up.)  After she made sure to tell me how much she liked it.<br /><br />Hocus Pocus isn't your standard Disney film.  For one thing, most Disney films don't make multiple jokes about a teenage boy's virginity.  (Parents, don't worry.  They went over my head and my sister's when we were kids, and recently they went over my niece's head.)  There's even a scene, watching as an adult, that I realized was a G-rated version of masturbation.  And the Sanderson sisters are much scarier than most Disney villains.  Hocus Pocus opens with the death of a young child and another tortured before being cursed.  But that's part of what makes Hocus Pocus so much fun.  It trusts it's audience.  It's more funny than scary, but there's a real sense of darkness that sells the scary parts.<br /><br />Plus, the cast is fantastic.  Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy are pitch perfect as the Sanderson sisters.  Bette is menacing, vain, and gets to exhibit her amazing pipes.  Sarah Jessica Parker is sexy, daffy, and absently vicious.  Kathy Najimy's face is a wonder to behold.  Omri Katz was familiar to me from Eerie, Indiana, one of my favorite childhood TV shows.  He anchors the child actors, which included the cute-but-not-too-cute Thora Birch.  And I still can't believe Thackery Binx (Sean Murray) is the guy from NCIS.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this Halloween classic yet, watch it.  Buy it for your kids.  (Or your sibling's kids, whatever.)  Watch it on Halloween.  You can use it to start off a scary movie night, or as a break between two intense films.  For the kids, pair it with films like The Nightmare Before Christmas or Coraline.  I know lots of people watch it with Halloweentown.  You really can't go wrong as long as you watch it.ica Parker is sexy, daffy, and absently vicious.  Kathy Najimy's face is a wonder to behold.

B006GLLREU|5.0|Just one of the most innovative, creative television shows I have ever seen. I would recommend watching this with the lovely significant other of your choice:)
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is not as good as pc but for a kindle fire its amazing the graphics are suprisingly alike as the pc i would reccomend that you buy it.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I love the Walking Dead! This season is good so far! I like the characters and this season, The Governor, seems very interesting.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Let me just say I don't watch a lot of movies any more, so when I do I want to be entertained. This movie will do it for you!  Lots of action, good comic moments, and good (not great) 3D.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend this movie for an afternoon diversion.  Would be good to show off your surround system and your subwoofer.<br /><br />I'd watch it again, and I have.  For me, that's saying a lot!
B0091THDOM|4.0|Product works as advertised, I would recommend this item to anyone who wants something small to fit their pockets.<br />Also holds 2-3 cards.
0307463745|4.0|I wonder why we distort common sense, create a whole set of processes (which is needed in some form in big organizations) and again revert to common sense and praise these as greatest inventions. The book is a set of things smart and agile people do. I can see these as documenting how things are done in a generation and for reference in future. Other than that, most of the things are common sense and reaffirms that it does work.
B004GYNPL2|5.0|I used msecure on my ipod touch before my smartphone. I tried some other programs on the Droid phone that were lame. I bought this version for my phone and love it. Its easy to use, has every catagory you could want.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|its so awesome I played it on my other phone and it was so cool it looks hard but it is really not hard.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is great and addicting. I play it as I'm trying to fall asleep normally I'm up for an extra hour.
B008I34ZFW|5.0|I watched it 5 times already and also loaned it out to friends. Don't take it politically serious if it makes fun of your favorite politicians. It makes fun of everybody in politics around the world.<br />They also make fun of the Hitler parodies on You Tube.<br />You have to laugh at the technology involved in the movie. It goes from one extreme to another.
B001KVZ6HK|1.0|My rating has nothing to do with the movie itself, which everyone has seen and everyone knows is excellent. My issue is with the format of this crappy 4-disc set.<br /><br />I bought this set because my brother has a blueray player, my parents have a regular tv and dvd, and I have an 11\\" Macbook air. I figured I could give them the discs and use the digital version myself. Well, lo and behold, rather than making the digital copy a simple online download - they chose the moronic course of sending the digital copy ON A DVD. Why the hell would I want a digital copy if I had a DVD drive??<br /><br />We had to network our computers in order for me to watch the copy on mine - and still, I have yet to download the movie successfully. Still trying.<br /><br />But perhaps WORST OF ALL, THE DELETED SCENES ARE ONLY AVAILABLE ON THE BLU-RAY DISC. This makes me so angry!!! Would it have been so hard to include them on any of the other versions??? As I don't have a blu-ray player, I have no access to these deleted scenes, even though I paid good damn money for this fancy 4-disc set. :-(<br /><br />ETA: CLEARLY, Marvel fanboys keep down-voting this review because I gave the movie a low score. Guys: nothing is going to bring down this movie's rating! Please only downvote my review if you found it unhelpful for deciding whether to purchase this product!! I take pride in my reviews. :-)
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this app! I am a night shift worker and this is about my most used app! Definitely worth downloading. It allows you to set the timer and you can create combinations of sounds that you love and fade each one in or out! Great App, very useful!
B00913DPW2|1.0|This game is so dumb and so boring! If I had paid $1.99 I would have been really mad! Do NOT waste your time!
B007SGM084|5.0|Purchase the trilogy and prepare to not want to put it down until your done. After reading the reviews posted I wasn't initially going to read these books but my sister encouraged me to and I am VERY glad she did. Once I started the first book I didn't want to stop reading. While I understand peoples comments about how \\"sexual\\" the book is and that it was an easy read I have to say that it is a bigger story than just the sex and BDSM features, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good page turning story that includes many ups and downs making each page turn that much more interesting.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This is a great game for the Kindle Fire, however there is a problem with in app purchasing. I purchased coins and the coin doubler but neither was registered by the game. Luckily Amazon refunded my money. I won't make any more purchases until the developer fixes this. I caution anyone from purchasing anything.
B007TK77QE|5.0|I loved it! I thought it was vastly entertaining and a smashing commentary on modern society. A very sharp mind at work here with so very much to say. I'll certainly be watching to see what else she does in the future. I do not understand the highly critical and negative reviews, which inevitably raise the HP series in comparison. Rowling is an talented writer and I think it is fantastic to see her pushing the perceived boundaries. In some ways it reminds me of Bob Dylan going electric way back in the mid 1960's, when some people went ape because he was expressing himself outside of the public perceived boundaries of his previous (folk music) genre. Do people really expect Rowling to write HP and similar the rest of her life? That would be a shame as I think this effort was really top notch.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|another outstanding book!!! The only downfall is the long wait for the next book. My entire family from young to old enjoy this series.
B003JTHWPA|5.0|I am sorry it took me so long to discover Carson Mccullers. She is oblviously one one of the best prose writers of the last century. I am looking forward to reading many of her other works. Seems everyone just needs somebody to listen, even the deaf.<br />vikki
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Could not stop watching until the last episode. Love instant video!! You can watch anywhere, anytime! No waiting for the DVD to come in the mail and you can't beat the price.
1118232658|5.0|Erik Qualman got famous for writing one of the pivotal books on Social Media called Socialnomics. His updated version is every bit as good as the original edition, which was a huge hit.<br /><br />Usually, updates are the same book with new statistics, but it looks as though Qualman went in and revamped quite a bit of the book.<br /><br />If you're looking for a well-written, inspirational book, this has everything that you're looking for. It's got some theory, but is mostly filled with practical information that can be applied pretty quickly to just about any business.<br /><br />Good book by a good author. Worth checking out.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is totally addictive that once you play you cant stop for all of the people who like to test their reflexes this is your game
B007EDYN36|3.0|I am halfway through and I have to agree with those reviews that criticize Peter for being a spoiled child in his 60s.<br /><br />While the book certainly has its entertainment value, mostly well written, with few mistakes and wrong word order here and there, Peter just overall summarizes himself as a walking contradiction of a man.<br /><br />Constantly picks on Paul's sexuality, accuses him several times of being unsure about his orientation, yet admits he and Ace used to grab each other's junk \\"in a friendly way, not sexually.\\" Right. A few pages later, he goes right ahead and suggests Ace once performed oral sex on him (!). But that's okay, because \\"Ace was crazy, ha ha.\\"<br /><br />Then he proceeds to tell his friend Ace just might have the worst voice in the world.<br /><br />He goes so far as to say, at some point, that Gene and Paul were the business minds in Kiss, while he and Ace were the \\"wild and crazy musically creative guys.\\" That's a joke at best, right, Peter?<br /><br />That's right. He has the audacity to say that \\"in his best days, Paul couldn't outsing\\" him, which is why they wouldn't let him sing so much in the albums... I mean, come on!<br /><br />He complains that Gene and Paul were hypocritical because they didn't do drugs when everybody else around them did them, as if to imply that he would like them better if they were stoned out of their minds all the time crashing cars inside parking lots with guns and dope in the trunk and what not.<br /><br />He admits he had sex with more girls he can remember, in circumstances that were degrading to those women, yet it is Gene who is a filthy pig, not him. Why? Because he (Peter) kept his religion and called his mom a lot to complain that he was \\"losing his mind\\" or something dumb like that. Says girls asked Gene to keep his makeup on during sex because \\"he wouldn't want to have sex with Gene without his makeup either.\\" Come on, Peter. Gene may be far from looking like Brad Pitt, but do you really see yourself as God's gift to women? Ha! Not now, certainly not then!<br /><br />What this book did (or rather, is doing) for me as a Kiss fan and a family man who has a job and values it, is confirm that walking the line pays off, and that behaving like a brat throwing tantrums because \\"the world is against me and does not recognize my unquestionable talent\\" does NOT pay off. In fact, it made me like Gene even more (I always liked Paul no matter what, but Gene had been getting on my nerves with all the merchandise and that).<br /><br />Peter, I love you for your work in Kiss, especially in the 70s, but as a person you disappointed me tremendously. You're a bona fide loser and your book is a manual to me of how NOT to be and what NOT to do. And it sure made me laugh here and there, too, although not for the reasons you intended, I'm sure.<br /><br />Thanks for the ride, Catman!e yourself as God's gift to women? Ha!

B009VA1FN6|5.0|this is an excellent well written story that has you gripped from the very start to the very finish, one of the best this year.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put it down...I read all three books in this series in 4 days!  I originally read it to see if it was appropriate for my 10 year old daughter...glad I did - well worth my time!  For and me!
B0090O07RS|5.0|It can be summed up very easily: stunning remix and remastering (on the audio side); beautiful HD scanning and restoration of the 16mm film (on the video side); and the bonus extras are all very interesting, entertaining, and look/sound great.  The Blu-ray even comes with A BOOK! Yeah. Not a huge book, but a little booklet with story, credits, etc. Well worth the money, and an absolute necessity for anyone's Doors collection.
1930485182|5.0|This book is informative and does what it says. It gives poses for common ailments during the monthly cycle of a woman. I love the simple drawings and all of the modifications the author gives. The yoga poses are not in common terms such as \\"downward dog\\" but instead use sanskrit. I actually love this because it forces me to really learn ALL of the pose names. I LOVE this book and will use it time and time again.
B00933ZG9A|5.0|Great acting. Timely, interesting and eerily current story. There is depth here. I can't wait until I can stay season 2.

B00846REIS|4.0|This is a great read. I loved 50 shades so I thought id try this series, not as racy as 50 but I enjoyed it and will get the next one
B008NB0SQO|1.0|It has been confirmed from actual copies of the 2012 Blu-ray release that Disney has yet again chosen to release only their cut, theatrical version of the film. There is no option in this release to view ANY version of the film that includes the song \\"When Love is Gone\\" that is so important to the plot development. While Disney is to be commended for bringing an HD version of this wonderful film to market, this review awards them the lowest possible rating of one star for displaying their utter disdain for the film's fans by failing to also offer the Original version of this film as created and preferred by Director Brian Henson.
B007SGM084|5.0|The book was recommended by a friend, and it has a warm beginning of a young heroine that the reader can identify and empathize. It starts with the heroine's common struggles of her daily life. It does seem to have some fire, from the very start, and picks the reader up immediately and pulls you right into the young woman's life. Enjoy!<br />.

B000OZ0NXA|5.0|All Jack Reacher novels are gripping; you can't put them down and go about your daily work. Jack is so intelligent, so admirable, and so clear about taking out the bad guys. Hurray! You don't have to see a killer sitting in prison and the public paying ten million dollars for his defense. Take the guy out! You are saving lives in the future that you know he will take out. I don't need to know anything about a Jack Reacher book before I read it: I know it will be magnificent. Lee Childs is one of the most gifted writers I know.

B009NQKPUW|5.0|I really loved this movie. We went and saw it in IMAX 3-D and have officially decided that we could not have chosen a better movie to watch with these special effects. It was twisted and fasinating all at the same time. Love it!

B009682E6A|5.0|Powerful and deeply moving. Their most mature album yet (not that any of their other albums were immature at all). The tones to be found in between the two guitars with headphones on are astounding. A must buy for anyone interested in a deep connection with the collective consciousness.

B005LAIGWS|2.0|Who is it that had the \\"brilliant\\" idea to make Nicolas Cage a superhero?  God, what a casting FLOP!!!! A washed up 50 year old actor, who looks more like 60, with caked on make up and a hair piece is the perfect guy for a hero, right?  NOT!  He looks tired, old and un-interested.  He does not add to the film at all.  Not that it matters too much, because the script is bad, the acting is bad, the special effects are so so.  The actions scenes are decent though.  On Blu-Ray, this movie is a lot easier to stomach than the big screen.  Here you can FF to the good parts and ignore the bad.  Still, you have way too much of Nicolas Cage and not enough of the Ghost Rider.  A similar problem with the first movie.  When I pay money to see a film called the Ghost Rider, I want to see the Ghost Rider, not Nicolas Cage!!!!  The might have just as well called the movie \\"Johnny Blaze, w/cameo's of the Ghost Rider\\". If you must see this film, then Blu-Ray is certainly the way to go.
B00006ADFL|5.0|HEAVENLY CREATURES is a true story about two teenage school girls who become friends in early 1950s New Zealand. Now, doesnt that sound sweet. Well its not! Its actually the exact opposite of sweet. It was ...what is the word I am looking for...oh yes, homicidal. Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme called each other Heavenly Creatures. They shunned the outside world and created a complex and elaborate fantasy world that they shared. Pauline, (Melanie Lynskey), who narrates the film, comes from a lower class family. She feels alienated from both her family and her schoolmates and walks around in a sullen daze until the day she meets Juliet, (Kate Winslet), an upper class girl who outwardly is beautiful and self assured but inwardly alone and ignored by her busy upperly mobile parents. The two compliment each other. They both feel superior to the lives they pretend to lead in humdrum Christchurch, N.Z.. They share a passion for Mario Lanza and the stars of Hollywood. Jackson does a superb job in inviting the audience into the fantasy world of these young girls and the cinematography depicting this world helps us to understand how seductive and enticing this form of escapism truly was to these two. The performances by both Lynskey and Winslet are top notch and along with the great direction by Jackson and creative storyline makes this film a haunting but unique view into the lives of two young, intelligent but insane teenage girls.
0307960471|4.0|Harry returns to his former home of Oslo to deal with a big problem. His former love, Rakel, has got a big one on her hands. Her son, Oleg, has been arrested. And charged with murder.<br /><br />This is the boy that Harry considers his son. As per usual, everything is not quite as it seems. As soon as Harry starts digging around, people get edgy - and people get killed.<br /><br />Harry is not that intimidated by anyone, however, and that includes top dog drug dealers.<br /><br />A big cliff hanger ending distinguishes this book from the other Nesbo books. This one has a very raw feel to it, yet also hopeful, as we see Rakel and Harry have not lost their love for one another. Harry's identity is wrapped up in his view of himself as a policeman, and that will factor in to Oleg's fate.

0399157565|5.0|It is like coming home. The newest Patricia Cornwell effort reminds us of the strong and formidable woman Kay Scarpetta was, and going through life crisis after crisis in the last few books, she is once again who we knew and loved. Kay has her swagger back. I, for one, loved the mistakes she made, and the weaknesses in her armor. It made her more human and more real as a character, along with her dysfunctional \\"family\\". None of us are perfect, and when a writer like Cornwell can suspend reality and bring us into her world of forensics and the bad side of human nature, so much so we can smell the decay and feel the dirt beneath our feet, she has accomplished all she wanted and more. Through Kay we experience the dive into the water and the difficulty of retrieving a body encased in a puzzling way, we touch an ancient relic of the sea, and feel all the emotions so many of us ignore or are too proud to admit. We can follow in each characters footsteps, and it was a special joy to walk in places I have been in Boston, making the newest adventure even more real. Thank you Patricia Cornwell for another great read, and a fitting tribute for a 20th novel.  It is time to start again at the beginning, and read all 20 Kay Scarpetta novels and relive what has made Patricia Cornwell the number one crime novelist.

B00913DPW2|3.0|The graffics are awesome and the music is chilling and you crave to dig deeper and deeper in the house and sheds but I finally had to give up. It got way too challanging going from one room to the next and there was too much info to memorize. a walkthrough I tried showed the person taking notes on their iphone app because solutions to puzzles remained on walls and the game comments that you should &quot;take a mental note of this&quot;. if you are into games like this then its an awesome game but I'm into those quicker hidden quests with less time consuming logic puzzles.
0385363141|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was more balanced. And it shows what believing in real love can do. I also liked that Anastasia was willing to join some of the old Christian part way.

1416550550|5.0|Kate Morton's novel, set in Australia and England, tells the tale of a century-long mystery, and of five generations of women.  The author evokes powerful imagery which enables the reader to capture the sights and sounds of the places she describes.  The characters, while not all loveable, are well developed.  The novel successfully alternates between settings and eras, often giving subtle precursors of events to follow. Some may guess at the ending, but there are enough surprises along the way to pique the reader's interest.

B00785P2QC|4.0|entertaining game keeps your attention makes it hard to put down your tablet.  hard to earn investor points but its a challenge
B008EQIEWS|5.0|Although \\"Clash of the Titans was fantastic I have to say that Wrath of the Titans was not quite as well done. Don't get me wrong it was absolutely amazing but I think they put to much into people remembering what happend in \\"Clash of the Titans\\".  That being said though the acting and the special affects where phenomenal. I was more than impressed especially because I usually have low expectations for sequels. I highly recommend watching the first one before this but nonetheless it is a good movie.

B0098460O4|5.0|Jonathan and Charlotte's Together is an awesome album! I've been awed since the first time I heard them sing on BGT's audition, and have been following them ever since. These two 17 yr olds are absolutely amazing. Jonathan's Tenor is spot on emotionally moving! and Charlotte's beautiful voice is the perfect compliment to him. Not only are they both incredibly talented, they are extremely well grounded and sweet! I love them, I love this album, even my husband, who does not like this genre of music (he's an 80's hair band type) has said this album will blow you away and that you wont be disappointed in it! The surging interest in the Classical/Opera/Pop mix fits them, and now is their time! I've listened to this album every single day since I got it (have had it about 3 weeks now, ordered it from AmazonUK), and I never tire of it...my fav songs are Vero Amore (Your Song), Canto Della Terra, Forse (Unintended - see this on UTube) and Il Mondo E Nostro (Rule the World), but seriously, I LOVE LOVE LOVE the entire album, and I've been telling everyone to get a copy! BRAVO! Bellisimo! This is fantastic :)

B00338QENI|4.0|I found the book to be quite interesting in revealing the life of Henrietta Lacks.  The book revealed the human side of a life had been forgotten<br />but her cells were immortalized.  I had always wondered about the HeLok Cells and how  they had received their name and the amazing ability of<br />these cells.  Great research and writing.
B0027MJU00|1.0|Shock and sensationalism at its best. Did Flynn think, \\"I will write the most disgusting, revolting, repulsive characters possible without redeeming qualities and lots of peole will buy it.\\"  There are lots of rednecks around where I live, but, gosh, they are nowhere near as nasty as hers.<br />Now, I really  enjoyed \\"Gone Girl\\"!

159562015X|3.0|This was a fine purchase, but not much in the book beyond Now Discover Your Strengths.  Since the book included an assessment code, it was worth the expense.

0802473156|5.0|I truly believe many relationships could be changed for the better if everyone was required to read and complete the assessment in this book.  Understanding what speaks loudly helps us to express in a way that is most valuable.

B008YZXYY2|3.0|As I have found to be the case with almost every double album I have purchased in recent memory, the second release is always widely regarded as the better half. Why this is, I'm not sure. Perhaps artists save their juciest material for the finale, or maybe there is just something more exciting about hearing the conclusion than the introduction. Whatever the reason may be, Stone Sour's House of Gold & Bones Pt. 1 is no exception. Frontman Corey Taylor boldly predicted last January that this two part concept album could only be described as \\"Pink Floyd's [[ASIN:B000006TRV The Wall]] meets Alice in Chains' [[ASIN:B0000028M7 Dirt]] on steroids.\\" If only it were so.<br /><br />There are only two similarities between House of Gold & Bones Pt. 1 and The Wall: First, House of Gold & Bones Pt. 1 contains a two-part song (could there be a third part on disc 2?)titled \\"The Travelers\\"; second, there will ultimately be a 2nd disc in House of Gold & Bones Part 2. Thematically, the two \\"epics\\" are vastly different. Where The Wall explores a myriad of issues relating to its central character, House of Gold & Bones Pt. 1 acts only as a slightly more focused effort than Stone Sour's previous albums, all of which, in some form or another, speak to the same topics as this album (think: anger, burnout, love, getting-a-grasp-on-one's-own-emotions, etc.). As for resembling Dirt, I am not buying into that at all. As one of my all time favorite albums, I can state with confidence that any similarity between Dirt and House of Gold and Bones Pt. 1 ends at Corey Taylor's comparison. Stone Sour's latest effort does not even begin to capture the frustration, pain, and emotion that Dirt so successfully encapsulated in 1992.<br /><br />Lofty expectations aside (and to be quite honest, I did not put HoG&B Pt. 1 into my stereo expecting to be blown away), HoG&B Pt. 1 still disappoints. If you loved Stone Sour before this release, you will likely still love them after hearing it; if you hated Stone Sour before, you will still hate them now. There are no major surprises on HoG&B Pt. 1. We get a couple heavy rockers in \\"Gone Sovereign\\" and \\"RU486,\\" a natural single and incredibly catchy track in \\"Absolute Zero,\\" a couple mellow acoustic tracks in \\"The Travellers Pt. 1\\" and \\"Taciturn,\\" and a handful of other tracks chalk-full of the type of material fans have come to expect from Stone Sour. There certainly is nothing ground-breaking here.<br /><br />Interestingly, Stone Sour does utilize some strings (\\"Tired\\") on their latest release. Perhaps the track that comes closest to living up to Taylor's prediction of wonder and awe, \\"Tired\\" is immediately distinguishable from its contemporaries by its slow but powerful buildup as well as the inclusion of said strings in the background. Also returning with a purpose are the piano and keyboards (\\"RU486\\"; \\"Taciturn\\"; \\"Influence of a Drowsy God\\"; \\"The Travellers Pt. 2\\") seen sparingly on their previous two releases, [[ASIN:B000G8NXBY Come Whatever May]] and [[ASIN:B00415R59O Audio Secrecy (Special Edition)]], keeping things just fresh enough to entice the listener. Fortunately, there also is not a huge dropoff in bass quality. Although I am not sure if former bassist Shawn Economaki left the band prior to or after the material for this album was written, Rachel Bolan (of Skid Row fame) fills his boots as the resident studio artist on HoG&B Pt. 1 quite well. Pleasantly, and as I have come to expect from Stone Sour, the production on this album is also top-notch.<br /><br />In the end, Taylor's lofty expectations for this double release are just that- lofty expectations. While there is certainly much to enjoy on House of Gold & Bones Pt. 1, specifically the ultra-catchy single, \\"Absolute Zero,\\" its successor, \\"A Rumor of Skin,\\" and the musically formidable middle tracks \\"Tired\\" and \\"RU486,\\" there is also nothing ground-breaking, nor is there anything unexpected. Stone Sour follows a winning formula that we have all heard on previous releases. Bad idea? Not at all. Exciting? Not really. Will it win over any new fans? Unlikely. Because Stone Sour sticks to its guns on this disc, a handful of tracks end up being real sleepers (\\"My Name is Allen\\" is the worst Stone Sour track to date). The bottom line is this: if you are already a fan of Stone Sour, then you know what to expect out of House of Gold & Bones Pt. 1. Personally, I was expecting something edgier than what I got, but I am still enjoying this latest Stone Sour release. I hold out hope that Part 2 will fill my appetite, but Part 1 certainly left something to be desired.evious releases. Bad idea? Not at all. Exciting? Not really. Will it win over any new fans?

B0083GQ2A0|5.0|\\"The Grey\\" follows a group of oil company workers at a pumping station in North Alaska, described by Ottway (Liam Neeson) as hell, occupied by \\"men unfit for mankind.\\"  These men seem to be looking for a job with good pay, no matter what the risks.  In the beginning of the film you see the men sleeping and drinking in their free time, oblivious to the outside world.<br /><br />A small group of men including Ottway, board a small airplane on leave from work.  During their turbulent flight, the plane manages to crash and leave the small ragtag group of individuals in who knows where.  Most of the men are killed quickly during the crash or die soon afterwards, but seven members of the group stay alive.  They have hope that they will be discovered, however, with the snow rapidly covering their crash sight, their hope quickly turns into desperation.  When one of the seven men decides to take a leak, ravenous wolves quickly pounce on him.  This becomes the setup for the rest of the film.  The thought that they not only have to deal with the elements, but also feral wolves, has to be demoralizing.<br /><br />The frantic journey these men endure is brought to life by terrific acting, mostly because of Liam Neeson, but the rest of the actors due well with bringing their roles to life.  What I enjoyed the most out of the whole film was the director's (Joe Carnahan) dedication to focusing on the individual, not just the overall group.  Each man felt like he had something to live for.  Although none of the characters are as developed as Ottway, you get a sense that these men had lives outside of Alaska.<br /><br />The ending may be seen as underdeveloped in many eyes, but I honestly liked the open ending.  It left you with room to wonder.<br /><br />I give this film 5 out of 5 stars.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so awesome that it is like Indiana Jones.So get it now or else I will say Minecraft is better.

0425221806|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, although at times I found myself skimming past the parts that didn't include Einstein...I think that was because I was so in love with him! This is really a great read, I literally had tears in my eyes at the end of the book because I was so happy in the way that it ended!
B000ELJBAA|4.0|During an interview for VH1's \\"Legends\\" program, when asked about Pink Floyd's blockbuster \\"The Wall,\\" David Gilmour said \\"It slightly lacks soul for me.\\"<br />And indeed Gilmour had been at odds with founding bassist and then-lead songwriter Roger Waters over the direction of the band's music, live performances, album cover art, temperature of the frozen yogurt machine in Eel Pie Studios, and just about anything else band members can dispute. The Floyd output under Waters' authority had been increasingly dark, but a solo album, Gilmour's second, allowed the heralded guitarist to breathe a bit easier.<br />\\"About Face\\" is certainly more musical than Floyd's most recent album, \\"The Final Cut\\" - but, despite being a brilliant album, even the sound of the frozen yogurt machine shorting out had been more musical than that record. \\"About Face\\" finds Gilmour loosening up, and crafting some impressive pieces, free from Roger Waters' glare. Though the album is definitely dated in places, notably the driving, technologically heavy opener 'Until We Sleep,' \\"About Face\\" finds some of the \\"soul\\" that Floyd's recent work had been lacking, notably in the invigorating, horn-boasting 'Blue Light,' the distinctly 1984 pop-friendly 'Love On the Air,' the gorgeous 'Near the End,' the very un-Floydian 'Cruise,' and the ferocious 'All Lovers Are Deranged.' The ballad 'Out of the Blue' and the commentary on the death of John Lennon, 'Murder,' foreshadow some of the sounds and themes the reunited Pink Floyd would later explore under Gilmour's watch.<br />Released just a month apart from Roger Waters' solo effort \\"The Pros & Cons of Hitchhiking,\\" David Gilmour had obviously fared better than his erstwhile bandmate at branching out creatively. \\"About Face\\" would be the guitarist's final solo album until the hit \\"On an Island\\" in 2006, but it stood up well during those twenty-plus years, a solid album that reflects a musician's creative desires, personally and professionally.
B0072GPQNG|2.0|I watched this movie because it was directed by Spielberg. Alas, his involvement wasn't enough to salvage it. The plot was extremely implausible, from one end to another - that a poor farmer would pay so much for the horse and bid against his landlord, that a thoroughbred would be able to plow rough ground, that the horse would survive 4 years overseas during one of the world's worst wars, that it would be reunited with the lad that had raised it, that it would be bought by a French farmer who had heard it was for sale, that British and German soldiers in 'No Man's Land' cooperated to free the horse after entanglement in barbed wire, etc. And I didn't appreciate the long, drawn-out war scenes either.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This is an enjoyable read,that leaves you wanting more....Ha Ha no pun intended..50 shades of Grey is a modern day Love Story that is enticing and inoffensive, that is of course my opinion.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great book.  I am very sad for it to end and I cannot wait for the next one!  I will be counting the days.....
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Excellent adventure,love story,with a twist of excitement for the &#34;inner goddess&#34; in all of us. Some &#34; the closed minded&#34; may find aspects of this read offensive. That's ok; different strokes for different folks. I found this trilogy exciting and am disappointed that I have finished it. I am left with a longing to indulge in another read as gripping as this, tho it will be hard to match. To E.L. James ....well done woman, and Thank You!
B005UDD1R6|4.0|Its free and it works.  What more can you ask.  Its not perfect, but its better than the Vplayer and I use it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|E.L.James does it again. This book does not disappoint, easy to read and leaves the reader wanting more. A real page turner, with twists and turns that delight and frighten as well as tap into &#34; every girls dream of a Knight in Shining armor&#34; fairy tale romance.
B006ZNRD06|1.0|I was not impressed with this player and uninstalled it.  I found the Avia player to be much better.  Since both are free, use whichever suits you.

B003AYMZO2|2.0|I payed over $20 for season 3 of breaking bad. I could have paid 7.99 for seasons 1,2,3,and 4 on NETFLIX. Plus, the video quality and buffering time was ridiculous. Blame it on my Internet, but Netflix, Pandora, my laptop, and the playstation can all download and receive info twice as fast as Amazon.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is the end to an amazing series in which the author presents us with amazing characters whom we want to get to know better and better. Great book, truly recommend the whole series, specially for psychology lovers.
B0098460O4|5.0|[[ASIN:B009TZ7WDK Together]]<br />This album is in a class all its own.  I have never in my life heard a voice like Jonathan's, and the pairing of his powerful, incomparably rich operatic singing with Charlotte's sweet, lovely pop voice in classical Italian is spellbinding. If you have any hesitation at all, go to Youtube and listen to all three of Jonathan and Charlotte's BGT performances--their audition, the semifinal, and the final--and when you pick yourself up off the floor, click your way right back here.  Beautiful!!!!
B000WCDBKM|4.0|The product came to me in perfect condition, I like this movie because Roman Polanski<br />put out a diferent kind of Johnny Depp´s acting that reflects a misterious and cautious person that fits perfectly to the plot of this movie
B004S49YEM|5.0|I first saw the movie version of this on TV many years ago. I was recently looking for something to read on a long flight and came across the Kindle version of this book. Good choice. Follett's prose is economical and easy to read yet full of detail. I knew the story but still enjoyed the development of the plot line.<br /><br />The characters are well developed and Die Nadel is not simply portrayed as a one dimensional baddie but Follett gives him some humanity. His brief fling with the heroine, Lucy, nearly proves his undoing. When Lucy uncovers the truth about her lover, she too faces a difficult choice. In the end, both Lucy and Die Nadel do what they have to do.<br /><br />A satisfying read and a story that can be easily re-read.
B004P1JDJO|5.0|This book is great!! Such an interesting concept about what motivates people not only in the corporate world but also in everyday life!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Saw Joel McHale tweet about how great this book was, so I thought I'd check it out. I was not disappointed. There are characters, even bit players, to care about and a truly different story. There's a tease at the end of the Omnibus edition that there may be more to come. Hope it's true!
B009KHDT0C|1.0|I really wanted to like this movie but I couldn't. Unfortunately, the comedy leaves much to be desired. Rent if you must, but I certainly wouldn't waste my money on a purchase.
B008JAG2AA|5.0|IDK why ppl chewed the cast out for doing another american pie movie because each one featuring the original cast was hilarious; and definitely a some of the most memorable comedies in history. I bumped it up from four to five for a somewhat shallow reason, which I won't disclose as to not spoil it for you ;) you'll see

B008HT4FUW|5.0|This series is outstanding and I am so glad I purchased the blu-ray UK Version and cannot wait for season 3 to be available.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The Mark of Athena is a real page turner. Every time I finish one of the books in this series I can't wait for the next one.  Rick Riordan just can't turn 'em out fast enough for me! Start with the Lost Hero and read this series in order.  When you get to the Mark of Athena, pay attention to the detail of this book. It will not disappoint.
B0048WQDIE|1.0|I think the character in the book was mean spirited and had no regard for anyone's pain but his own. Don't like being around people like that in real life much less reading about them.

1451695195|5.0|I've been studying Quantum Physics/Mechanics for some time now, and this story is right on with what I know about science, the Universe and spirituality. A very important book in my opinion; with a long list at the end of other recommended books to continue your research if you so choose. Also, I highly recommend this book to anyone who has suffered a great loss; This will put your mind and soul at ease. I guarantee you that the skeptics about this story are ignorant about Quantum Physics. FYI - Quantum Physics is \\"Science.\\"

B000056VJ7|5.0|Phil Spector could've produced this album it has that much production value.  One of the most popular and appealing albums ever made.  Meat Loaf is way over the top, but that's the joy of it all.  The best 3 songs are Paradise by the Dashboard Light, Two Out of Three Ain't Bad and You Took the Words Right Out of My Mouth.  There have been more important albums in rock history, but there aren't that many that are more pleasing to listen to, especially if you like big productions.
B0002IQMKM|5.0|Great CD complication from the Talking Heads, spans their career hitting all of their best music.  A must have for your collection.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This was my fav of the 3. Wish there was another. I recommend all three books in the series. This one had more of a mystery plot.

B00846REIS|5.0|Was a great book. It is similar to 50 shades but is different as well. Great back story not just a erotic novel.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Fun fast read. Definitely reading the trilogy. Kept me up late a couple nights.<br /><br />Read it.
B009GEELDS|5.0|This episode was great. Such a nice way of following up the official Caskett union at the end of the previous season. Here we find Castle and Beckett already a few months into their relationship and going strong, though now that Beckett's returning to work (you knew it was gonna happen), both Castle and Beckett have their reasons to want to keep their relationship secret. It's great seeing  these two characters finally embrace each other whole-heartedly, and Katic and Fillion are very convincing as two lovers finally in love. Definitely excited for the rest of the season!

B008YZXYY2|5.0|Corey Taylor has awesome vocals, we all know that. But why do people hate it when he doesn't scream all the time? Are people mad that this isn't as heavy as slipknot? What's the point of having a side project if he can't try out new stuff... how is this generic? Anyhow, if you love stone sour/rock/metal, buy it. If you want slipknot, GO BUY SLIPKNOT

B002SAUCBC|3.0|After seeing the rating I was really excited about the book, It's one of the first novels of my favorite author, and sadly it shows. Don't get me wrong, it's still a great novel, but SK went a long way in developing his narrative thru his career. The characters are very cleverly tough, but lack the usual deepness of characters in other books, also I didn´t get the usual imagery of other SK books. Probably it's a book that will communicate more with teens.<br />Still it gives you a different perspective on SK, actually this was originally published using a pseudonym
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This was a great read.<br /><br />The author takes many of the best elements of modern, post-heroic fantasy and assembles them into a credible world and unique vision.  I mean to be complimentary when I say that it felt in parts like The Lies of Locke Lamora and bit like Lois McMaster Bujold's Chalion novels and even a bit like Ender's Game (although a very different world).<br /><br />There was action and mystery and intrigue and both a surprise ending and an unsurprise ending.<br /><br />Perhaps it is a reflection of our times that one of the book's major themes is the nature of religious intolerance and values of personal loyalty weighed against the needs of society.  Not everyday fare in a swords and sorcery serial.  :)
B008FSCNTK|1.0|Regardless of how I feel about Diana (I love her musical sensibilities), this is a flat out terrible cd that will be banished forever from my collection. I don't know who T-Bone is but any music bearing his name will have me scurring in the opposite direction, this is stunningly bad as far as I'm concerned! Diana will do very well sticking with Tommy Lipuma!
B001EC2ISA|4.0|Beetlejuice is in my opinion a classic film with not enough Michael Keaton. Although he is the titular character, this story is more about the characters Adam and Barbara (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) and their struggles in dealing with the afterlife. After their early death in the movie, they have to stay in their house for a certain amount of time before they can 'move on' but things go horribly wrong when a modern, city couple and their moody daughter move in.<br /><br /> Without spoiling too much, I'll let you know that Beetlejuice still holds up very well today. The story is fun, the effects are a little cheesy but not horrible, and the comedy is almost nonstop. I gave it 4 stars due to the lightning of the film being poor in some areas. I kept hoping someone would bust out a flashlight during the dinner scenes. Overall, you are certain to enjoy this movie, especially if you're trying to see it as part of a Halloween marathon as I did!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book. I can't wait for the next one to come out! It's a roller coaster ride between the two of them and I can't wait to see how the next one ends.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game id fun I think it should take less time to get coins. but it is a fun game I would recommend. it to a friend
B003NOKEE2|1.0|Pirated. Bad quality. Packaging had a hole. Worst purchase on Amazon I've made. Very disappointed. Would never have bought it had I known. The item was touted as authentic.
B008MM9630|5.0|I really like this game so I hope to get the updates like other players who did the reviews. it is really entertaining to play. I hope it will not end. I love planting the crops and nurturing animals. so thank you.
B005ZUR724|5.0|this game is the most awesome rpg on mobile divides.<br />I personally wish I could get the new update<br />plz put on the new update
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book was very helpful. I am a first time publisher and it took me step by step.<br />It is easy to understand and a great tool.<br />Thanks for this invaluable help.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I was exactly what I was expecting. It works and plays great. fast delivery. came with everything that was mentioned in the description.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|The typical DeMille story which has characterized his works for a long time. I highly recommend his works to anyone not familiar with his writings.
B009QW7HMC|5.0|It was OK, not the greatest, taking to long to get to the story line. The first two seasons are the best so far.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|its not a bad game.  the only prov I have is that some times the app freezes so I have to get out of the app then back in.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What an amazing imagination. Enjoyed it and was spellbound . Could not put the book down . Not only for the youth!
B00004RCMN|1.0|It was shipped from England, and the format is not comparable with any of my DVD players (3).<br />Waste of money and not worth trying to return. I won't anymore DVD,s from Amazon.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|Generally the puzzles are pretty easy. It does get a bit difficult after the 4th stage, but it's only out of 5 stages. It's fun and challenging, but also very short, takes about 30-45 minutes straight to beat the whole game. Replaying it allows you to build up your score and keep your items, with \\"increased difficulty\\" but that isn't much harder either. Currently on my third play through and I haven't seen much difficulty increase. If anything, it's getting easier because I'm adjusting to the game style, items, and levels. Not sure about paying $5 for this, but for a free game (I got it on the free day) it was definitely a nice addition to my game collection.
B008VBYN80|5.0|This was awesome. I cant wait to play more.which I will rightnow. The game takes time though and you need to pay to play at a decent pace..which Mindanao of sucks
B004UG7RQ0|1.0|If anyone owns a 2006 Acura TL, do not purchase this product.  It connects but the sound is so significantly low its better to just listen to music straight from your phone.
B008NABUU8|4.0|It's a good game but it does lag some times. It does make you think about what to do next. Good for engineers!
B005EGXTEE|5.0|First book on my new kindle & I read it in 3 sittings!!! Can't wait to finish the trilogy & watch the films!
B008UFUOH6|5.0|It's finaly here, and I am so happy that she did it. Tracy has the most heavenly and underrated voices from the last few decades. Heartfelt and just the music to get you in the mood for the season. C'mon, she is even singing a Dolly Parton song, amazing.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|A timeless book that is sure to please every little girl and some boys too.  Generosity, family, courage, all hallmarks of this book.  I loved it as a child, and I love it now.
0955153077|5.0|I actually waited a while to pick up this book. They did not sell it at Barnes and Noble so I just waited around for the chances they might. Well, it never happened. So, I bought it from here. Man, I have ben missing out for all this time. This book is much better than I thought it would be. Very impressed by the clear explanation of the author. Great packaging and cool examples. Very much worth it for the beginner or the seasoned artist.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This book is brilliant!  It should be made into a movie.  It reminded me of Forrest Gump - genius!  In the movie, I would cast Tom Hanks in the lead role.  This is a book that you don't want to miss reading.<br />My only critical remark is that I'm having a really difficult time finding anything I can enjoy reading.  Nothing can keep me reading non-stop like this one.  I finished reading it over a week ago and I still miss it.  It's been many years since I've read a book I liked this much.
B000EMGAGW|5.0|I don't understand all the hatred for this Mobb Deep album release 'Blood Money'. Is it the fact Mobb Deep signed with G-Unit? I don't blame them for signing this deal. Where they would be appreciated by there label not a after thought on the back burner. Anyways, whatever the case maybe the material on Blood Money is no doubt above average. Tracks like \\"Speak So Freely\\", \\"Put'em In Their Place\\" and \\"Click Click\\" sound like classic, grimmy Mobb Deep joints with the beats and lyrics. \\"Give It To Me\\" featuring Young Buck sound like a perfect strip club track or when your alone with a nympho freak to throw onto a mix. \\"Pearly Gates\\" Hav/Don P & Fif got some decent verses and story telling on this joint. \\"Capital P Capital H\\", \\"The Infamous\\" tracks you heard on either albums 'The Massacre' and 'Get Rich Or Die Tryin Soundtrack' \\"Have A Party\\" featuring Nate Dogg R.I.P. \\"Outta Control\\" round off 'Blood Money' sufficiently.
B0086DBE62|5.0|I needed a laugh and this definitely took care of it.  Julia Roberts did a great job getting me not to like her and the dwarfs were hilarious .
B00571F26Y|4.0|My husband's cardiologist suggested this diet for my husband. We have been eating healthy for the past few years but still struggle with that belly weight. I run 12-15 miles a week, and still struggle with my weight. The first few pages of this book really spoke to me. I've been a big promoter of wheat bread being so much better for you and wheat pasta and so on... What's surprising is, we don't miss the wheat. The receipes are filling and taste really good. Now sometimes in the real world it's hard to avoid wheat but we just deal with it as best we can.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|What can I say... if I could I'd give it 10 **********<br /><br />I just can't get enough of it. And on your flipboard pages you can add boards to your favorite sites (ie: twitter &amp; facebook). And with the news its like holding more than 3 newspapers in the palm of your hand.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|This was not DeMille's best, but it was a good read.  I look forward to him going back to earlier story lines and away from current terrorist genre.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|IF YOU LOVE TEMPLE RUN YOU WILL LOVE SUBWAY SURFERS. IT IS WAY BETTER THAN TEMPLE RUN. YOU SHOULD DEFANTLY GET IT.
B0096HI226|5.0|The movie is awesome and actually has more depth to it than simply stripping. Channing Tatum is great in his role and he shines. Highly recommended, and I'm a guy. It could also teach you some cool sexy dance moves :)
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Simply the brightest flashlight on the Kindle Fire! I use this flashlight in the dark and when there aren't any battery operated flashlights available. I also used it in preparing myself for Hurricane Sandy. Highly recommend this app! This app does not replace a flashlight since regular flashlights extend there light farther but is just as bright and very bright for a screen so again I highly recommend and I hope it works great on your android device just like it works great on mine for me!
B007GCY8FS|1.0|huge disappointment.  nowhere near the caliber of past books.  totally hung up on trival facts about states and distance.  not one good Reacher segment in the book.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|I bought this for my ex-wife to watch since she is a BIG fan of musicals. I am trying to use the time we spend as friends to constructively build our relationship up so that in the future, if and when the chance arises to get back together, things won't be so hard as if we never worked on them at all. With that said, the way this woman loves musicals (especially exciting and well produced), this is an awesome start to making things better. She has had it for a week and a half and so far it hasn't left the DVD player apart from movies for my son. And when she's playing his movies she'll put Rock of Ages in her computer and watch it. She won't admit how much she REALLY likes it, but she hates watching movies more than a time or two right off the bat. She has watched it about 15-20 times in 10 days. She LOVES it... If your significant other likes musicals... This movie will put you on her good side... If I had any reason to take a star off of this, it's mainly because the fact that Tom Cruise is the main character. But, since he plays a part that I feel was typecast for him, it makes me feel better to see him as Stacee Jaxx. It's almost that they just got him really drunk and gave him a cowboy hat and told him to be himself and he just did. He might not of even known that the movie made it to theaters. Should we tell him? \\"HEY MAN!!!\\"  *aaaaaaaaaa!!! aaaaaaaaaa!!*
B009GEPPYC|5.0|This movie was absolutely not what I expected, however it was very enjoyable and of course Tom Cruise was as good as ever!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|the best game in the hole world. Omg I love it I wish I could it my self my friend has it. I loooooooooooovvvvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeee.  iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiittttttttttt.
B00005U122|5.0|If you are on the fence about this product let me push you off and go  get your<br />wallet to order this one you won't regret it
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Great book, as always.  Patricia Cornwell always delivers the best Kay Scarpetta.  Fast read, always wanting more and waiting for another book.
B005XBKXV2|5.0|Good fast download and acts as an awesome babysitter :-)I would certainly recommend this to anyone that has a kindle fire or amazon account
B00992CF6W|3.0|I cant get this app it cost way to much money I am so agervated because I have it on computer and xbox but I cant get it on here
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This is a really Great Book & very Interesting to read. The Author is Clearing many MYTHS & MISTAKES about HEALTH, FITNESS, NUTRITIONS and so on... The Text Layout & Formats are Fine & Interesting but lack of Illustrations but as I purchased the KINDLE Edition & Author Added some Additional Online links of different websites so the Lack of Illustrations has been replaced. Well, I'm just in beginning of my Journey for becoming BIGGER, LEANER, STRONGER & I'm going to just start the Plan in this Book, I can't say anything about one main thing which is RESULTS but After Two Months, I'll come back & edit/add this review further more. But as I've read this book & gained MUCH KNOWLEDGE, So I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR EVERYONE.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Good way to kill time for 5 minutes or an hour.  It is a series of variations of the same memory game.
0316228532|2.0|I could only get through one third of the book before I had to put it down and give it away. I loved the Harry Potter books and looked forward to this new book. The language is extremely offensive as well as sexually explicit. I tried to overcome this but found the underlying story to be too slow moving. I'm not looking forward to any further 'adult' books from J K Rowling...
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I really like this game. The later levels get much more challenging because of the tiles blocked off all by themselves. The graphics are nice and easy to see. I play on my Motorola Atrix 2 and never have a problem. Great way to spend itme in a waiting room if you don't want to read.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book at first seems like its just going to be all about sex but in the end it is so much more than that
B00913DPW2|5.0|I really like this game. I enjoy the mystery of it and uncovering the clues. There are hints available if you can find the hidden moths. This brings back fond memories of Myst.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|This was an attempt to be the beginning for Alien.  Not a very good attemt even using the actress from the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  It seem to be all about computer grahics and a badly knitted together plot.  Hard to connect up the dots with this one.  Another \\"lets do it for the money\\" film. Direction and acting were left out because they would interfere with the supposedly cool graphics.  Save your time and money, this was a bust.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is way too easy to spend hours playing this game. I shouldn't have installed it, but it a great way to pass the time when sitting in a waiting room.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|I was disappointed in this production.  The script was loosely wooven and the plot was rushed not allowing any time for humor or theme to develop.  Johnny Depp could not save the lack of well written comedy/drama.  The movie gave the appearance of being thrown together hoping that star quality would save it.  Worst direction I have seen, really murdered Dark Shadows without any farse relief in sight.  It goes to show that doing it for the money can do you in.  I guess Johnny has lost his feel for art.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|A most interesting walk through history as it pertains to the rediscovery and impact of the writings of Lucretius, which have had a more profound influence on modern thought than one would have expected from a 2000 year old poem.  The reader will make many connections to, and and see many parallels with, issues in today's world.
B005LAIHE0|5.0|I was very surprised with this movie (should have ignored the low ratings. The script was brilliant, unpredictable, bittersweet and engaging. It was not one bit of light, dumb, Adam Sandlerian nonsense, at the end I felt like I want to own the movie.  What I enjoyed most was the melancholy throughout the whole film that made it very realistic and credible and connected. Segal is pretty talented!
B007REV4T8|5.0|Hyped sky-high, worldwide media blitzed, billboards commandeered: 007 glares out from every corner in the land.<br /><br />It seems a lot of trouble to go to for just another Bond film; it even gives pause to wonder of this grand Dame of a franchise, in her fiftieth year: doth the lady protest too much? Is the party over for 007 and his backdated brand of boyish bravura?<br /><br />This question is on Sam Mendes' mind too. And 007′s, and M's. This time it isn't just James Bond who is the dinosaur. It's MI6 itself.<br /><br />Previous Bond franchise reboots have been about modernising a diehard chauvinist throwback. That this was quixotic and self-defeating was demonstrated by the effete outputs: Goldeneye. Die Another Day.<br /><br />Sam Mendes addresses that head-on: Daniel Craig is scarred; haggard; careworn. Old. He looks like he's had enough, even before being snipered off the roof of a goods wagon during a punch-up over a high Turkish gorge in the opening scene.<br /><br />To underline the air of finality, as Bond's body hits the water and floats into a truly old school animated opening sequence, a truly old school Bond theme strikes up, and in the fashion of a truly old school Bond chanteuse, Adele sings, to almost exactly the tune of Diamonds are Forever \\"This is the end\\". Good gracious: they're not declaring the innings closed, are they?<br /><br />It's a question that hangs over the two and a half hours of Skyfall.<br /><br />MI6 has carelessly let its roster of embedded under-cover agents fall into terrorist hands, and now they're being systematically whacked in full view of the world wide web. In trying to retrieve the list 007 has been shot, seemingly dead: collateral damage of a risky shot by his own colleague, Eve (Naomie Harris). A risky shot taken at the direct order of M herself, in knowledge of Bond's jeopardy, we fear to protect herself as much as her department.<br /><br />And now the net is drawing in on M herself. Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), a career bureaucrat, is put in charge of the department. He wants M out in a month. All done the proper way, by dignified retirement: a very British coup.<br /><br />In her eyes she knows her days are numbered, but M is having none of it, not while there's still work to do. Dumbledore repairs to her study where her favourite boy wizard - the boy who lived - awaits. (Forgive me confusing my movie idioms: as the film progresses the similarities become ever more striking)<br /><br />Time to get back to what we do best, James. Old school style. And always, confronting our right to be here: are we still relevant? Are we still understood? In the middle of this social revolution are we still fit for purpose? If we're to best make sure we're not redundant, how should we respond?<br /><br />M's, and Mendes' answer: go back to basics; concentrate on what we know best. Old school.<br /><br />Bond sits in contemplation at the national gallery in front of Turner's painting of the HMS Temeraire, a willowy veteran of the Battle of Trafalgar, being towed by a steampunk tug to be scuttled. He is interrupted by a precocious teenager (Ben Whishaw), who turns out to be the new Q. But this time gimmicks are muted: a palm-print personalised Walther PPK and a miniature radio tracker. Old school. Bond reverts to his old DB5. He's tempted to use the ejector seat on M when she's haranguing him: Old school.<br /><br />Much has been made of Javier Bardem's villain, but this film isn't about the villain. Raoul Silva is no Anton Chigurh; Bardem plays him almost as comic relief. His villainy is barely needed: Skyfall deals in a far more claustrophobic perfidy than him.<br /><br />Things proceed with a sense of scale and grandeur that James Bond has never in my experience attained, for two and a half hours. It feels like there's more at stake than is usually the case; it feels here that, however it ends, the Bond universe will have irreparably changed. And so it turns out. The ending is moving, profound and ingeniously it leaves the franchise ready to embark upon a next decade of adventures, with all the pieces in place.<br /><br />Old school.<br /><br />Olly Buxton, profound and ingeniously it leaves the franchise ready to embark upon a next decade of adventures, with all the pieces in place.<br /><br />Old school.<br /><br />Olly Buxton
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I bought it thinking it would be MORE on the Bin laden mission. That consisted of about 30 pages. That section was good, but as a whole the book seemed to be jumbled and random thoughts as they occured to the writer. It had a big build up but failed to meet the hype.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have read Ken Folletts books since his first The Eye of the Needle and have enjoyed everyone of them since.<br />I love this new trilogy, and just finished Winter of the World, didn't want it to end,I will look forward to the last one!<br />I think his development of characters is always so interesting, along with including them in the history of the times so clever that I love to talk about it with my friends, the size of the book never bothers me, so tell him to keep on writing
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|Might be quite entertaining to a younger person, but I'm 47 and found \\"Tom\\" quite boring.  He is very cute and the animation is very good, but after about 2 minutes, I had enough.  Sorry \\"Tom\\".
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you've played block story I would recommend this game. I'm not saying this is better because they're both good in their own way. But as I said I would recommend this game to you if you liked block story
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I like that I can set it to the requirements that I need. its my day plan. I use it everyday.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Fifty shades grabbed me right away as did the other two all three were an exiting read would like to see what else the author wrote
B005LAIHY0|4.0|As a diehard aliens fan I was super excited to see this movie. I'm saddened that it left more questions then it answered.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|As a member of the armed forces, I appreciate the availability of this narrative.  I also think that it is accessible for the non-military reader.  Take advantage of this uncut account of the raid.
B003ES61EE|4.0|The fine brush and lens cleaner combo is an invaluable addition to a camera bag, and the AmazonBasics model seems to perform as well as any.<br /><br />My sole complaint, and the reason this isn't 5 stars, is that the cleaning pad end, which is switchable between a round and triangular pad, is only friction-fit into the barrel of the device. The result is that when you pull the cap off the pad assembly tends to stay stuck in it.  Not world-ending but annoying to deal with in the field.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|The first season of Homeland is a must see show.  It could not have been easier to buy and watch episodes.
0817439390|4.0|I'd been shooting for several years when I read Understanding Exposure, and frequently found myself nodding as the author verbalized something that I knew in a vague way but hadn't condensed into a concise concept.  In that respect this is a great book for the intermediate to go through to cement things that may not have quite clicked yet, and of course it's an excellent introductory book for new photographers.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the writing style is grating in parts. The author seems to go out of his way to try to sound clever and it falls flat.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|Was not bad. I felt it to be a little to slow at times and really predictable. Other than that, for scifi this had great effects and was pretty good for eye candy.
B001EQ5ZJK|4.0|When I started reading this book I didn't realise how much it would change my thinking about the world and how I sit within it.<br />I have suffered through the victim mentality for quite a number of years, dealing with bipolar. I have been to CBT and taken meds to fix myself and now I realise I was coming at my situation from a completely defeatist position. Thank you for having this book in your reading list, you have saved my sanity.
B008XG1X18|5.0|perfect. works great and fast! love it:))) works great on my kindle and my android. I'm very impressed! get it and get started!
B009QW7HMC|4.0|the amazon instant video needs an iPhone app. it's basically useless without one and won't compete with iTunes. good quality video though.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|When buying cases sight unseen I often worry about the case not fitting just right, or there being some defect, or that it's some cheap flimsy thing.  It just wasn't the case with this case.  Sturdy but not bulky.  The way that the Kindle fits into the case prevents it from falling out of it, so all the outside flaps have to do is just stay shut.  No chance of it slipping out that I've found.  It's already made several cross country trips and no signs of wear and tear yet.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Although it was a little early to watch a Christmas movie, we always laugh with this one. Absolutely, great on BluRay.
044024367X|3.0|Was an ok read, read in a day but liked how it ended but story seemed to be filled with a lot of \\"junk\\" I just didn't need to know --- ending was a great big bang of a boom though!
034580404X|5.0|I loved this series so much. The story was just captivating I read each book is 3 days or less. I hope tis author is busy writing another great series.
B00943SQCI|3.0|It was an enjoyable movie, although a lot of the funny parts were shown in the trailer.  Depp has done better work, but it's still an enjoyable movie to watch.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Yes received 2 days after my estimated time but it was well worth it. My son is enjoining it very much his facial expression was priceless
B007FEFLTO|5.0|sorry guys, got this book a couple of weeks ago but since it is almost 1000 pages and it needs some serious time to read it, no review will be forthcoming!  I can say, however, that everything by Ken Follett has been awesome - including book one of this trilogy so I hold out the same for book 2!
B00004WX4X|1.0|There was like no music on it. I don't know how else to explain it as no sound. Not sure how that happened.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille is one of my favorite authors.  John Corey is my favorite character.  The book is terrific.  I've been so busy that I haven't finished it yet.  So far, I love it!
B008C1O8CA|5.0|Uno! is better than I expected. I grew up on Green Day and love all of their albums (except 21st Century Break Down... what a waste). But Uno! is a throw back to everything that made me love these guys in the first place. Snotty, pissed off punk pop at its finest. If you loved Dookie and Nimrod (there's even a few Warning-esque tracks), you gotta get this album. Can't wait to see what Dos! has in store.
B007F7QG0Y|3.0|&#34;When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me&#34; ... but wait, what if you didn't?  You'd be the subject of &#34;Life.&#34;<br /><br />If you ever played in a rock band, took it on the road, enjoyed some regional popularity, played a stadium, or spent hours dialing back records to figure out who's playing what (especially if it never crossed your mind that the guitar wasn't in standard tuning), you'll like this book for the parts about the band.<br /><br />Then there's the parts, seemingly endless narratives about drugs and other stuff.  It gets tedious.  Yet another person addicted to fame writing about addiction to drugs and especially with so little insight to the havoc in the lives of others.  Skimming helps, but you have to watch for a nugget slipped in here and there.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Ridley Scott ensures the continuity of the Alien story with this accurate (finally) prequel to the series. So far I haven't found a loose end in the story. A friend mentioned that in the Alien series, one of the giant \\"human\\" aliens is found in a spaceship control chair with it's chest exploded indicating the release of the newly \\"born\\" alien. But in this movie the giant alien is killed by the hero. Answer: It was stated that there were many ships that never would leave the planet. Hence the hero escapes in one of the other ships left behind and the ship found in the original series was just another \\"dead\\" ship with it's dead pilot.<br />Note - The players were a bit cowardly albeit they were not told why and where they were going. I think just to go on this type of dangerous expedition through hyper-space just for the money, they would have more guts and not run away like teenagers in a vampire flick. But it still worked, ergo 5 stars.<br />Charlize is perfectly hated as the antagonistic Company \\"person\\". Great job!
B009QW7HMC|1.0|Never showed anything about the other group and what was happening at the prison. I know they were trying to introduce the new villian, but it was a very boring episode.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Surpisingly good science fiction, loaded with action, and brute force vs. brute force and WE WIN.....YAY! No brainer, shoot-um-up movie but THATS OK sometimes for this kind of entertainment....also, the story made sci-fi fact sense. Remember it's fiction so any premise goes.
0380713802|5.0|I have read and enjoyed most of Bryson's books. Can't tell you how many times I've read A Short History. I own a couple of his books about words and language and have read one or two that I wish I had kept.<br /><br />Neither Here Nor There is his funniest. Much funnier than Dave Barry, who is nowhere near as funny as his reputation. Sorry, Dave.<br /><br />Bryson copyrighted Neither Here Nor There in 1991. That's 21 years ago. Therefore all the information is totally out of date.<br /><br />But it's delightfully written. I often laughed out loud -- hard.<br /><br />So read it.
0345495004|4.0|\\"Loving Frank\\" by Nancy Horan was more enjoyable and became more vivid to me as I re-read this book when listening to it on audio. Although I did not like the person of Frank Loyd Wright any more the second time, than on the first read, I understand his story on a different level.  There is no doubt as to the man's brilliance and creativity, but there is great question as to his character and ego. I am glad that I read the book again now have a clearer picture of Mamah as a woman and a mother and a spirit before her time.  She was a person who made mistakes and made choices and then spent her life having to live with her most defining choice, that of choosing love.<br /><br />Taliesen, designed and build by Wright is described quite splendidly in the story as are some of Wright's other creations. The secondary characters in the story are well developed, especially key workers and kitchen staff. In order to not create a spoiler review, I will simply say that this is a book worth reading if you have interest in architecture, historical fiction or even the women's movement as it progressed. For me it was not an easy story to read as the characters were hard for me to like.  Their strengths and weaknesses were easy to identify relate to even if in disappointment. Loving Frank is a well written book with a strong story to tell. I gave it a 4 star review.
0823015033|5.0|I love this book.  It even goes through, step by step, how to create your own sculpting tools.  The only thing that would've made this book even better, would be if they'd added a section on sculpting animal figures as well.
0812993292|4.0|I bought \\"The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry\\" by Rachel Joyce yesterday morning and read it on my Kindle the same day.  It is a fast read and a most unusual story. As I followed the trail of Harold Fry and the characters from his home life and those that he meets on his journey, I was alternately interested and engaged, and then I was not connected at all.  I did not know about this book and would not have chosen it but I am glad that I read it.  I think it will spark great book club discussion and allow us to see the story from different perspectives.  One good reason for joining and participating in a book club is that it takes us out of our normal selections and helps us expand our reading choices.  I am going to read it again before the club meeting for I feel this may be a book that may be better understood and appreciated on the second read.  I would give the book  a 3.5 - 4 rating.<br /><br />PS...I would definitely give this book a 4 plus on the second reading and following deeper discussions.  It is indeed a book that will stay with you for a long time and will cause positive reflections about people you meet along your life's journey.

034580404X|5.0|I absolutely love the Fifty Shades Trilogy. The suspense while your reading is exhilarating. When I first picked up the book I couldn't put it down, I read it in 1 day flat, and the second book in 2. I just started the 3rd book but had to take a little break because of mid terms lol. The moral of the story is amazing and really touches your heart I would love these books w/o the intense erotica. I recommend these books to everyone I come across. :)

0525953728|3.0|\\"No Easy Day\\" has a lot to recommend it - it's a lean, spare book, free from hyperbole and narrowly focused on the life of Navy SEALS.  And one cannot quibble with the choice of subject matter, as the raid on bin Laden's Pakistani compound is the real-life stuff of Hollywood blockbusters.<br /><br />So why the mediocre review?<br /><br />First, because the book is actually too narrow a tale for the full story of the bin Laden mission.  As the authors admit, they really only came in for the tail end of the mission - they pulled the trigger.  This observation does not belittle their achievement in any way, but it recognizes that the soldiers were not involved in the herculean task of discovering where bin Laden was.  \\"Mark Owen,\\" the psuedonym of our hero, meets one of the intelligence officers who actually tracked bin Laden down and we get to see her reaction to the successful raid (one of the more poignant and effective scenes in the book) - something tells me that there is a magnificent epic to be told about the tracking - and the killing - of bin Laden.  Here, we really only get the closing act.<br /><br />Second, while the book offers a lot of details about life as a member of the special forces, it doesn't tell a great story about that life.  Owen says that the life puts a strain on families, but offers only a couple of brief anecdotes to back it up (although the image of a SEAL coming home from a mission, only to be told to change the baby's diaper, was pretty darn funny).  Owen describes training and says it's hard, but \\"No Easy Day\\" is hardly a riveting examination of the training regimen.  It would be like a marathoner saying, \\"I trained for a marathon, I ran it, I'm glad I did, but boy was I tired.\\"  We get a few minor stories about the guys playing practical jokes on each other and a few battle scenes, but I was left wanting more.<br /><br />Full disclosure - I picked up \\"No Easy Day\\" after reading M.M. Kaye's magnificent opus, \\"The Far Pavillions.\\"  Thathuge book, one of the best stories written in the last 30 years, offers more enjoyable details in ten pages than \\"No Easy Day\\" contains in its entirety.  So perhaps I'm being unfair.  However, I wanted to adore \\"No Easy Day,\\" and I cannot say that I do.<br /><br />This should be a story that you want to re-read over and over, and all I can say is that once is enough.
0679731725|3.0|While reading this book I found myself wondering how and why it had been awarded a major literary prize.<br />--The narrator is so dehumanized and oblivious in his responses to virtually everything that it's difficult to empathize with him.  The scenes with the narrator's father and the dysfunctional relationship between the two men give some idea of why the narrator is so stunted emotionally, but that doesn't really help the novel.<br />--The main female character behaves in such a childish and petty way when thwarted that it's difficult to empathize with her.<br />--The endless musings about importance and dignity are reminiscent of the endless musings about the nature of quality in Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.  Fascinating to college freshmen after a couple of doobies, but pretty thin support for a novel.<br />--And then there are the supporting cast: the dotty germanophiles, the ignorant villagers, the youthful liberal, the crass American.  Clich&eacute;s all.<br /><br />Halfway through I realized that this book is in some respects similar to Animal Farm.  The characters are unrealistic cardboard cutouts but the novel is more palatable if you regard it as a political parable.  Orwell did it better, and with more originality, but Ishiguro has come up with a different approach, for which he should be given credit.  (On the human and interpersonal level, a film like The Hireling, for example, did a far better job of dealing with the angst and inequity of the class system.)<br /><br />In spite of Ishiguro's somewhat creative approach, I can only go as high as three stars because when the characters are human there has to be something to make us care about them.  It's very hard to get wrapped up with a cast that is so mentally and emotionally limited and deliberately obtuse.  I'd give it two stars, but Ishiguro gets credit for designing a functioning robot and maintaining the same tone and ambience from start to finish.  This literary world is internally consistent--but it's terribly limited and limiting.istent--but it's terribly limited and limiting.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|I found this book very respectable it was  A very good help. I wish there were more books like it.
1451695195|5.0|I found Proof of Heaven simply amazing and fascinating.  Although I am Catholic, what I appreciated about his writing is that he makes no mention of \\"religion\\" or \\"what you must believe'... because his approach was scientific, I think that it will reach far more souls than if it was purely \\"religious.\\"  I also think that it may clear up some of the claims that heaven is only for a select few... or a particular people who believe a certain way. The sheer vastness of the universe and the lack of words to even express it confirms once again my thoughts that God is so far beyond what we know of Him.
1401234542|3.0|While many of DC's properties are being rebooted, Green Lantern is one of the few series that remains nearly untouched by this massive overhaul. Geoff Johns, one of the greatest DC writers out there, once again takes the reins of the Green Lantern series to offer a new, more lighthearted take on the character. In \\"Green Lantern: Sinestro,\\" the Guardians take away Hal Jordan's power ring due to his history of reckless and tragic behavior (like becoming Parallax, for one thing), and he's forced to attempt a normal life and start up a new relationship with Carol Fenris. Jordan's power ring selects a new host, much to the surprise of pretty much everyone: Sinestro, former intergalactic terrorist and arch-enemy of the Green Lantern Corps. Sinestro isn't pleased about this, to say the least, but realizes there are a few things he needs to do. As such, he teams up with Hal Jordan and gives him a self-made power ring, and the two head off to take care of Sinestro's past demons. But when the Guradians begin to order a new Corps-- one that doesn't require either of our two protagonists-- the trouble thats brewing may be too much this pair of galactic guardians!<br /><br />As the title implies, the book focuses heavily on Sinestro, and I liked that. Sinestro has always been one of DC's most interesting villains due to his moral code and attitude, and Johns does fans a real justice when he digs more into ol' Thaal's background. Reading this book was a lot like watching a buddy cop movie, as Sinestro's cold, calculative, and twisted view of justice clashes with Hal Jordan's brashness. The art was great, and the action scenes, while not overly-plentiful, certainly had an \\"epic\\" scale and feel.<br /><br />The problem with this book is that, as I mentioned before, this book is pretty much unaffected by the New 52 reboot. As such, new readers or comic fans who haven't been following Green Lantern comics the past few years will get lost. Characters will jump in and out who will onlybe familiar to more serious fans, and the whole plot thread about the Guardians wanting a new Corps is pretty much dropped as the book goes on. And, as with other hardcover collections, the text can be occasionally cut off.<br /><br />Ultimately, though, this was an enjoyable read. Although the story can be jumbled and it definitely isnt merciful to new fans, it does dive more into Sinestro's character (which I enjoyed), and the artwork was terrific. It's certianly not a bad book but it's also not anything past \\"good enough.\\"
B008S4FZHI|5.0|Patricia Cornwell never fails to deliver with Scarpetta Novels. The Bone Bed is no exception. Excellent read and throughly recommend this book.
B008PWUYVA|2.0|The Timbuk2 Gripster Jacket is another in a growing list of Kindle Fire covers, and I decided to give it a try.  However, I was disappointed with the results.  On the positive side, the Gripster fits well without blocking access to the speakers or controls on the Kindle.  The Gripster also works well as a stand thanks to the \\"grips\\" on the side.  On the downside, the Gripster feels cheap and mine arrived with a tear in polyurethane on one of the corners on the back.  There is no padding to speak of on the Gripster, and the cardboard on the front and back is very prominent making it feel like a covered shoebox.  For a cover with better materials, padding, and a quality feel; I would recommend something from Targus instead.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|The second book in this trilogy is far better than the first book. While the first book was pretty good, the plot thickens in the 2nd book.
1400067820|5.0|Continuing (and building on) the themes from [[ASIN:1400067936 Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets]] and [[ASIN:081297381X The Black Swan: Second Edition: The Impact of the Highly Improbable: With a new section: \\"On Robustness and Fragility\\"]], Taleb provides a very thought-provoking (and unconventional) look at how systems should be gauged in terms of how they thrive in shocks as a true measure of strength as opposed to traditional risk/volatility metrics.  In a way, the main theme seems to be traditional approaches deny the natural antifragility systems have and we shouldn't manage risk. It is counter-productive.<br /><br />Such a statement, obviously is going to provoke the ire of legions of risk managers and they may have a point. But using a wide variety of arguments leveraging the concept of stressors, domain dependence, causal opacity, hedonic adaptation, Taleb laments the \\"touristification\\" of systems and the Procrustean nature of how we tend to look at systems.<br /><br />Mixing philosophy, mythology, (highly) disrespectful humor, Taleb provides a very intriguing and convincing way to look at systems, particularly how we quantify risk.  He is at his best when he defends the notion of entrepreneurship where he is able to clearly articulate the impact of serendipitous tinkering as opposed to formal education - and this celebration of entrepreneurship takes over a good portion of his arguments.  The discussions on stochastic resonance - why adding randomness can be good - and how the artificial suppression of volatility is bad is very informative. Perhaps the best part of the book is the lucid discussion of optionality - and how one could use options and optionality as the foundation of measuring \\"fragility\\".  that discussion, alone, is worth investing in this book.<br /><br />The verbose narratives, crude sense of humor, frequent jumping-around-topics, and a general lack in editing are all hallmarks of Taleb - this bookis no exception - but that makes the reader pay extra attention to what is being said.  With 500 pages, this is no easy read.  But Taleb does an excellent job of separating out the more technical portions in a way that doesn't impact the flow of his arguments. The long citation list and Taleb's own technical papers based on the themes in this book is likely to keep a curious reader busy for a year or two.<br /><br />This is a book I will re-read every few months or so. Two key concepts - optionality and the general discussion on artificial management of volatility suppressing natural anti-fragility - have made this book a true 'enlightener' for me. Absolute must-read.

So happy I did.  These guys rock!!
B000001FTJ|5.0|It's hard to name a favorite Waits album, but if I had to, this just might be it. Some might say that Swordfishtrombones is the first Waits album that is experimental or indicative of things to come. I don't entirely disagree with that, but the way I see it, Waits was exploring unchartered territory in many of his songs all along - certainly in his lyrics, and also with his voice. Nonetheless, I do think that Swordfishtrombones is his first album to reveal the depths of the types of choices and risks Waits is willing to take as a recording artist in each and every song. I think that Swordfishtrombones is the first Waits album in collaboration with his wife, Kathleen Brennan. Brennan clearly has an enormous influence on the work, and an influence that, in my opinion, is hugely positive.<br /><br />Full disclosure, Tom Waits is probably my favorite recording artist as I write this review, and has been for at least fifteen years. I think he has an extraordinary ability to express an enormous range of human emotion and experience; his work continues to evolve; his use of rhythm and his voice are absolutely stunning at times. I've had many different favorite Waits' albums since I first heard him back in the early 90s, but the one I keep coming back to is Swordfishtrombones. This album is an excellent reference for fascinating lyrics, aural risks, captivating stories and characters, and innovative musicianship. And somehow it works as an album; it's a collection of songs that somehow fit together and feed off each other while covering a hugely broad range of topics that feel at times almost magical, subliminal, or dreamlike, and at others as real as the eggs chasing the bacon around the frying pan.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I liked he story overall  as it was very intriguing and mysterious, i find myself  wanting to visit the circus now. however i was greatly distracted by the narrative present tense voice though i know it was purposeful it was distracting in endeavoring to suspend my disbelief and enter into the book. <br /><br />But the story was well worth the small annoyance. i enjoyed the rest of it immensely. it was vividly written and well plotted.

B001AVCFK6|4.0|THIS is how you reinvent a franchise.<br /><br />There is a big reason this movie works beyond the spectacle on display.  The film's heart is in its characters that are clearly younger versions of those icons from the classic television show.  While everyone gets a chance to shine in this \\"assemble the crew\\" story the lion's share of the warmth on display here belongs to Kirk and Spock.<br /><br />It would have been easy to just jettison what came before but the filmmakers managed to incorporate that problem into the plot.  Once it's finally explained in a short exchange on the bridge they said goodbye to the old and the new takes over into any direction it wants.<br /><br />I am not enough of a tech head to figure out the nuances of High Definition visual quality but I see no complaints from my basic system.  The big draw with this edition of the movie is putting the extensive extras on a separate blu ray.  Fans and film school people should have some fun with what's been shown here.  A digital copy and a demo for a computer game is on the third disc instead of a DVD.  Don't let that be a deal breaker.  Make some new fans with this version.

0375507256|5.0|Ten minutes after finishing this book I found myself lonely for it, desperate to wear in the binding from chapter one and begin anew.  If it were possible to un-know the contents of \\"Cloud Atlas\\" and discover them again, I would embark on this journey every year for the rest of my life...the powerful images still flit through my daydreams and nightdreams...an aged composer...a stopover in the Chatham Islands...a dystopic ultramodern Korea...a publisher, locked away...<br /><br />This book will enchant the deepest parts of your curious, questioning mind, and if you haven't got one of those, this book will give it to you.  I am not the most well-read bon. lass `mongst the bookish Warrior Womyn class of the Pacific Northwest, but I punch in more than a few nights a week at our City of Books and somehow always make time to hole up and retreat to my page worlds--thus with this trifling credibility I entreat you to read this book; it is probably the greatest work of our century.<br /><br />\\"Cloud Atlas\\" is a genre-bending voyage through times, spaces, cultures, races, political systems, social orders, religious assumptions, genders, and so, so many more of the hinges that humanize us.  The author has described his championing work as a \\"sextet for overlapping soloists\\", in which each solo is interrupted by its successor and in the second, each interruption is continued in order.  The byzantine structure of the book is woven by six overlapping stories, each revealed by not only different characters but also vastly dissimilar flairs of script.  The author graces us with stylistic fluctuations of historical, science, neo-noir, dystopia, farce, and comic fiction, and each takes their shape via diaries, letters, mysteries, interviews, and a tale told around a fire.<br /><br />The dense book is daunting at first, but when you consider that it covers kindness, cruelty, civilization, greed, vengeance, art, history, faith, tradition, love, family, religion, barbarism, enslavement, release, the corrupting and dehumanizing nature of power, the universal cultural story of societies rising, falling, and building again, all told with a stimulating and challenging narrative, it is amazing that David Mitchell could manage to fit a lifetime's (or two or ten's) worth of philosophizing into a mere five hundred pages.<br /><br />Somehow, without my noticing, the book managed to fit ALL of this discourse into an entertaining read that detonated my cognizance towards the minutest of intricacies, but closed on a simple, beautiful theme.<br /><br />The last lines will leave you sated and bursting with a love of man.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the book elicited within me deep stirrings on God and What Is Godly.  The multiple religious constructs presented in the book had me questioning my own lack of questioning in hateful ways, only to feel, at the next chapter, a deep yearning for the conviction expressed by the characters therein and a jealousy of their certainty--which I found amusing given that my region has the lowest rate of church attendance in the United States and consistently reports the highest percentage of atheism.<br /><br />Throughout the book you may notice a handful of blatant references to other films, books, stories, fables, musical passages.  Why would the author appropriate, plainly and in even the least-cultured reader's sight, the characters, story arches, and concepts of 1984, Blade Runner, Nurse Ratched, Soylent Green and other classics?  These references are rife with meaning and are not to be casually overlooked.<br /><br />In addition to confronting tough and unfamiliar language, I had to concentrate very hard just to glean every bit of meaning from the lush passages.  Many key thematic tirades were loaded with double and even triple meanings, and I found myself pawing back and back again just to be sure I had them all.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers that it was hard to get into Chapter One at first, in fact, all of the chapters were a little bit hard to \\"settle into\\", and they took quite a bit of \\"legwork\\" and guessing from the reader in terms of determining time, place, new characters, etc.  I didn't care for the middle story (the central anchor) much...call me lazy but I don't like invented slang that takes hours to dissect; it feels gimmicky, and his payoff wasn't worth the reward to me as a reader.  The work was well worth it though, and by the time I was 25% through the book I knew I wouldn't be able to eat, sleep, or do ANYTHING until I had finished the entire thing.  Work through the research and enjoy this part of the process...your patience will be greatly rewarded.<br /><br />I predict \\"Cloud Atlas\\" will go down in publishing history as the rumbling cult favorite that spawned the visionary artists, thinkers, and designers of the future.  This book is required reading for anyone who aspires to pass through the ignorance/innocence of childhood and into the realm of adulthood.<br /><br />Take the time to dissect this beautiful gift of a novel and be forever enlightened as to man's capacity for love, hate, good, evil, and maybe, just maybe, deliverance.hapters were a little bit hard to \\"settle into\\", and they took quite a bit of \\"legwork\\" and guessing from the reader in terms of determining time, place, new characters, etc.  I didn't care for the middle story (the central anchor) much...call me lazy but I don't like invented slang that takes hours to dissect; it feels gimmicky, and his payoff wasn't worth the reward to me as a reader.

As much as I loved the book, this adaption of it was perhaps even better. The show is very well written and well acted. Michael C. Hall does an extraordinary job portraying the title character. From the opening sequence of the first episode to the last scene of the season finale, this show delivered.
B007OWRBJK|4.0|I am not a huge Who fan but I enjoy learning and reading about what drives enduring talent in their field of expertise.  Like most industry leaders Pete is very driven to deliver what he considers perfection.  Pete was very honest about his demons and how it ultimately destroyed his marriage and almost his life.  Through all of the chaos, living in a rock and roll world with drugs, alcohol and sex he was able to find his focus when it was time to create more magic. I never knew that Pete was the driving force behind The Who. He wrote the songs, created most of the music, he was a true genius.  I think most people thought that Roger Daltrey played a larger role with The Who's success.  It was fascinating to learn how many different business and personal interests Pete has.  This book is a history lesson about Pete, The Who and rock and roll in general. Fascinating book.

While waiting for the CD to arrive I picked up the Bright Lights EP which was great and hopefully a harbinger that Blak and Blu would be something even greater. When compared to the Bright Lights EP, this disc is a letdown. As other reviewers have mentioned, there are some great songs here but you'd be better off to listen to the samples and just buy the songs that suit your taste instead of spending hard earned money for half an album that will probably not be your cup of tea.

B007THA4FI|4.0|I admit it, about a third of the way through, I was ready to give up.  Character development was fine, but I didn't really care about them...and plot was missing.<br />Then it all started to kick in.  By the end, it all fit together beautifully.<br />It seems to me that Rowling found success with Potter by dealing with larger-than-life heroes and villains and dueling in impossibly imaginary worlds.  Consequently, I'm guessing she decided to test herself (and the market) with supremely ordinary people interacting in a mundane world.<br />Does it work?<br />Yes.
0684857219|4.0|I brought this as a birthday gift for my husband who already has fitness knowledge but wanted more... it was the perfect gift for him. He loves it and is learning a lot. A great book for all levels. And old book but def a classic you should consider buying!<br /><br />I have it a 4, simply because I am not fond of Arnold... and I'm writing this review :o)

B0091REZMW|2.0|its fun till u run out of diamonds and when u go to the store u might as well forget it cuz just about everything costs with diamonds and the only way to get more diamonds is that u have to pay for them with real money I think that's bull shit cuz poor ppl like me who cant even afford for my own socks it would be a lot more fun if there was a way to get diamonds without paying for them I swear they think everyone is rich well news flash not everyone has fancy cars there's ppl like me who don't even have a bicycle to ride on so ya its bull shit
B007SGLZP8|2.0|rather complicated but not very original and nearly up to the level ofb his early work. not quite down to the level of phoning it in (see afterward) but headed in that direction
0374214913|4.0|Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore was hard to put down. I had to force myself to take breaks from reading it actually---I did not want it to end too quickly.<br /><br />  It is an adventure story---a sort of Tolkien-ish quest. It has ancient secret societies, book manufacturing history, typography history and an eclectic collection of odd-ball characters that totally should exist in such a story. However, it is also a modern high tech tale, where the real magic is performed by people using computers instead of wands and wizard-staffs.<br /><br />  I really really enjoyed this book. I believe you will too. It should even appeal to Young Adult readers---there isn't anything in it unfit for innocent eyes. For the younger crowd, the book also has quite a bit of fantasy role-play gaming tidbits tucked in to it.<br /><br />Get the book, you wont regret it, I promise.
B007THA4FI|3.0|The Casual Vacany did not keep my interest. Since I did not read the Harry Potter series Iam not use to J.K.'s style. Iam use to the Enlish writing style as I  did lived in England for several years.
0141018828|5.0|I'm not qualified to comment on the quality of translation (of this particular version). But as a work it should be read widely, not only for the thoughts it offers, but also for the perspective it provides on Roman thinking and early western philosophy. It is powerful stuff and I found best read in small doses (each night, in my case). It was something I looked forward to every evening before turning out the light. Life, death, honour, rationality are all explored and one cannot help but thinking that Marcus was noble and wise emperor.
B001P9EQH8|1.0|I was so excited to get this amp but only disappointed to find out that it is FAULTY. The lights don't work and apparently it came with a faulty battery. The light would just blink red when i charge it and it won't turn on because it won't charge.<br /><br />So disappointed. Take care before buying this product.
0231161166|4.0|Some readers may find this review of a critically important emerging field of science over detailed. It's not written for lightweights or readers of US Today. But it's well worth the time and effort and yields a host of fascinating facts, observations and predictions. Its subject matter is the very essence of life, your life and those around you. It is, as the title infers, revolutionary. The understanding of how we influence our genes (and of course are influenced by them) is changing rapidly and the author clearly has a magnificent grasp of the facts, the science and researchers on the cutting edge. A number of her predictions have already come true (including the latest Nobel Prize winners) and her speculations about the future alone are worth the price. I rate the book 4 (rather than 5) as it dwells excessively on details of biochemistry that, for the layman, might seem unnecessary to understand the bigger picture. But that aside it was absolutely fascinating and thought provoking.<br /><br />This book may be obsolete in 2 years so pick it up now and be amazed by what has been learned and humbled by how much has yet to understood.
B008469DGY|5.0|super fun golf game! Easy to learn and provides many many hours of flicking fun. Most definitely worth two bucks fo sho! enjoy and game on
B0083V2VW8|5.0|This is an amazing restoration of a classic rock movie and it looks great! I later saw clips from the original and can't believe the difference!
0316228532|1.0|I tried so hard to like this book but 200 painful pages in I had to give up.  There are too many characters with basically nothing going on...it just drags and drags.  I understand that she is unraveling the dynamics of small town life but holy crap batman, enough is enough.
B005FISC52|4.0|First of all, I'd like to point out how hilarious it is that the first question of this review was \\"Are you over 13?\\" Bahaha, sorry... I guess a lot of 13 year old's must watch this.<br /><br />I bought this for a friend as a gift and she loves the show. Not my kind of show but I consulted her before creating the review. She does tend to like the beginning few seasons better than the latter, but still needed to complete the series.
B00884GR0W|5.0|this game is amazing! contains adventure, quests, and building. i strongly recommend trying the free version first to see if you like it. unlike this one though, you can build, it just won't be saved. also, this version has been updated.
B003Y5H556|4.0|A very interesting off shoot from the red riding hood story. I thought it was very cleverly made, and the actors/actresses played their parts very well. I suppose I am a bit bias since I am a pretty big Amanda Seyfried fan, but she plays a great character in this movie and looks damn good whilst doing it.
0525478817|5.0|I don't know how many books I've read but none of them have touched me as quite  much as this book. Simply put John Green is a genius. I went into this book only knowing two things, that it was about cancer and according to all the reviews on Goodreads it would make me cry.<br /><br />The reason I loved this book so much was because of Green's ability to create such fleshed out characters. Most times authors' focus only on the two main characters while giving the secondary characters dialogue here and there. Not John Green. Although the focus is on Hazel and Augustus we still get to meet the awesomness that is Hazel's mother. I like how she was a real character which isn't what we often see in YA.<br /><br />The reason I put this book off for so long was because  I was afraid it would be depressing and boy was I wrong. John Green uses just the right amount of humor. The romance between Augustus and Hazel is so sweet. I loved how even though right off the bat they liked each other their relationship started with friendship first. Now I feel I should warn you that if you are going to read this you should probably invest in a box of tissues (because those Goodreads reviewers were right you will cry. Alot.). Also, don't read this on the bus (people will stare when you cry).
B005H0IW6W|4.0|I got this as a gift for my girlfriends mom, it's hard not to like Buble and even harder with this album. I am a fan myself but particularly this album. He puts a fantastic twist on your favorite songs and it just makes Christmas that much better!<br /><br />She played it through the entire winter even after Christmas! And I'm pretty sure I cought her listening to it this past summer a few times as well... hahaha
B00846REIS|5.0|I had read the \\"Grey\\" books prior to reading this book. At first it gives you oh this is basically the same. But keep reading!!! I found that I actually enjoyed this book more. I felt it was better written and just a better story. If your reading this and have not read the grey books and find at the end you need a little more kink the grey books should be your next read.
B008S4FZHI|4.0|With twists and turns and unexpected findings no wonder a Scarpetta book is one of the few that you can't stop reading once you have started.<br /><br />Well done, an excellent airport read providing you have someone to pick you up at the other end.....
030759565X|5.0|Yes, a fan of her blog/website.  I like how she does her recipes and I do like how she can adapt other chefs recipes to her style.  She does give those chefs the credit.  Writing, living the food life does bring the \\"family\\" into view.  Since her kid is growing up fast...having his picture in her first book was no surprise.  She writes about him in her blog/website, I don't mind this added focus in the book.  Having children is....well...part of life.  That is what she writes about....Food and how family mix in with how food is prepped, taste and how it looks like. The website gives you lots of pictures on the food prep which is helpful.  The book makes it easier to find all her recipes in one place...at my place...the print outs are stacked, bundled and some are in binders....some of them have my photos of the prep....some of my shortcuts.  I will say this...I have no problem with her taste.  Her taste is good and my husband enjoys her recipes and I enjoy the prep work.  I was so very happy to now have the book in my hands....very old fashion....I like the feel of a cookbook and how it looks.  I hope you enjoy this book and if you have the time...her blog/website. Enjoy the adventure!
B009QW7HMC|5.0|Just when you didn't think it could get any better, it did.  The walking dead is full of action packed, zombie thrills as well as surprises around every corner for the characters.
0060599847|5.0|It is very informative and it did spoke of what needs to be done step by step to succeed. But as you all know there are allways barriers sometimes from your Family, demands on the responsibility that either you comply or you risk loosing what you got going on. One day maybe I find the way to overcome those traps.. good luck to all of you. This audio material is simply great...

B008HK3XYK|5.0|I wanted a nice colorful case for my Kindle HD and found this one. I had gone to several stores and could not find anything that I wanted to spend any money on. This case came exactly as described and on the exact date the website gave me. I am very happy with it and think you would be as well.
B009YSSDGC|5.0|The 2XK serial killer is the only villain in the \\"Castle\\" mythology whose seemingly limitless evil frightens even Richard Castle.  This episode resurrects - and then kills - that character again but what it really does is show just how deep the trust between Beckett and Castle has actually become.  Plus it is an obvious precursor for another episode that will surely follow where we'll meet 2XK again and hopefully, finish him.  One of the darkest \\"Castles\\" ever but also one of the most moving.<br /><br />Don't listen to the naysayers on this episode - they just didn't get the ending!

B00979CS50|5.0|Crazy Horse, that is.<br /><br />Here he is talking about drummer Ralph Molina in his autobiography, Waging Heavy Peace, \\"...Ralphie is extremely subtle and can express emotions beautifully in both a ballad and a laid-back song. He is completely unique, emotional, and driving at the same time. His flourishes with my feedback at the end of a song are always right with me, as if he knows right where I am going. Fact is, we are going there together, feeling our way, and that really applies to all of Crazy Horse. That is what makes the Horse as great as it is, and as cosmic as it is. That is the Force of the Horse. Making the new albums, Americana and Psychedelic Pill, I have found that this cosmic force has increased, not diminished, with time\\".<br /><br />This love and respect comes through loud and clear throughout Psychedelic Pill. It's clear that these guys just can't get enough of playing together. As the packaging label notes, the result is \\"...over 85 minutes of music\\". One full hour of this is comprised of just three songs: Ramada Inn, Walk Like a Giant, and Driftin' Back, a lilting 27 minute improvisation. Can there be too much of a good thing?<br /><br />At first I thought maybe so, but as I listened again I thought really no.<br /><br />We also learn in Waging Heavy Peace that Neil is into long road trips in big 50's Lincolns and Cadillacs, and that's kind of what these songs are like. The beat just keeps beating, and it takes you away, far away. Maybe that's what he means by the cosmic force of Crazy Horse.<br /><br />My favorite songs are Twisted Road, For the Love of Man, and Walk Like A Giant. Twisted Road is a tribute to Dylan<br /><br />Like Hank Williams chewing bubble gum,<br />Asking me, \\"How does it feel?\\".<br /><br /> In The Love of Man, Neil sings poignantly for his son Ben;<br /><br />For the love of man<br />Who could understand what goes on<br />What is right and what is wrong<br />Why the angels cry, and the heavens sigh<br />When a child is born to live<br />But not like you or I.<br /><br />And Walk Like a Giant, a defiant affirmation of life even in the face of crumbling and disintegration;<br /><br />I used to walk like a giant on the land<br />Now I feel like a leaf floating in a stream<br />I want to walk like a giant<br />I want to walk like a giant on the land.<br /><br />It ends with four minutes of single drum beats synched with jagged, distorted guitar chords. Is is a giant walking? Is it a heart beating?<br /><br />Whatever it is, it's like nothing you've heard before. Those who say they'll fast forward through this part miss the point.<br /><br />Five stars.born to live<br />But not like you or I.<br /><br />And Walk Like a Giant, a defiant affirmation of life even in the face of crumbling and disintegration;<br /><br />I used to walk like a giant on the land<br />Now I feel like a leaf floating in a stream<br />I want to walk like a giant<br />I want to walk like a giant on the land.<br /><br />It ends with four minutes of single drum beats synched with jagged, distorted guitar chords.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|Great book, great author, another John Corey classic.  Can't say enough about this series, if you haven't read any of the John Corey series, go ahead and get them all.
B009IQG5LK|2.0|Where are all the Blu-ray special features?!. Not evena trailer. or the animated short \\"Roller Coaster Rabbit\\" which was released theatrically with this movie. No retro interviews with the cst and crew!? Not good!!
B009GEAPYW|4.0|Overall good treatment of Frank Miller's version of a middle-aged Batman, returning to the battle for Gotham.<br /><br />For those who were not around at the time, this was the seminal re-imaging of Batman, from his various incarnations as campy crimefighter, popular hero and so forth; this Graphic Novel brought Batman back to his roots. No witty one liners, no bat-devices to conveniently tie up or immobilize opponents. No, here is a brutal vigilante, loved by some, hated by others, feared by most, who enjoys a tenuous relationship with the law, based on his friendship with the current commissioner, who is soon to retire.<br /><br />All told, I thought the movie did a pretty good job of making the jump from Graphic Novel to Animated Feature.<br /><br />I found the movie to be on par with Batman: TAS, as far as animation quality. Peter Weller is good as Batman/Wayne, so no loss on that front.<br /><br />My one point down is only because a) I really like the voice over which was provided in the Graphic Novel, and do miss that aspect, and b) I wish they could've done a longer movie, and managed the entire Graphic Novel.<br /><br />Still, all in all a good treatment. I will most definitely rent the second movie to see how they handle the conclusion.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great book, keeps your interest all the way through. Very surprised by the ending... Cant wait for the next one!
B009NQKPUW|2.0|The movie was kind of &#34;eh&#34; for me. The plot seemed jumbled and the characters are so dumb you want them to be killed. Not much else to say.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This has an alarm clock I can set on the days I want it to go off. It comes with a timer also. You can choose the music you have on your device or a selected ringtone as the sound.

B000003TAR|5.0|Nirvana's In Utero is something of a bastardizing record (if you've heard Nevermind, you know what I'm talking about) but that's the beauty to it. I think as a whole it showcases the sound Nirvana was striving towards their entire career. I really do.<br /><br />The record opens with the lyrics: \\"Teenage angst has paid off well / Now I'm bored and old\\" and they set the tone for the entire thing. Kurt's vocal performance is brutally despairing and you can really hear the pain and emotion in his voice. It's a bare, honest, and raw-sounding album but retains its emotion, which combines for an unforgettable collection of songs. You've got to give Steve Albini major props for his production skills which shine so vividly on this album.<br /><br />And if you don't 'get it' right away, keep trying. Seriously. You will eventually. But if you don't, then I don't think you'll ever 'get it'. For me, In Utero is a humbling experience to listen to and it never loses its luster. Keep in mind that I am an avid music listener who's heard countless records from every era and nearly every genre. That being said, In Utero is undoubtedly the most important album in my life and my absolute favorite album of all time, yada yada yada (along with Nevermind, of course).<br /><br />Love them or hate them, Nirvana was a special band with one hell of a drummer and one phenomenal bassist, and Kurt Cobain was a truly gifted man, not to mention a genuine poet.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|Some clever ideas and the author excels at descriptions of spaces, places and objects (the bookstore, the model city his roommate creates in their apartment, the Google campus, and the HQ of the secret society). But the characters are cardboard flat, especially the love interest. Imagine a happy, shiny, clean, talkative Lisbeth Salander. Also, it's one long uncritical love poem to the creative genius that is Google.  Imagine if Kurt Vonnegut had written books extolling the Schenectady GE campus.  Really just a bit too gee-whiz upbeat and technology-happy, even though the author clearly loves artists, books and book history.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Not much one can add to over 1000 reviews. I am a huge fan of Burroughs in general and the Mars series in particular having first read \\"A Princess of Mars\\" over 40 years ago. Here are some impressions from that perspective that I came away with:<br /><br />1. Plot changes. They were certainly necessary as \\"Princess\\" ended on a cliffhanger. More importantly, \\"Princess\\" was a book with a lot of exposition which can work well enough in a book but is undesirable for a film. Films need a faster pace than a book.<br /><br />2. The Therns. The Therns are certainly much more powerful in the film as compared to the book(s). On the plus side they do provide a convenient explanation for how Carter gets to Mars. This was badly needed as Burroughs was very vague about this. On the debit side they are too powerful and make Carter too much of the pawn and not enough of the all conquering hero that Burroughs created.<br /><br />3. Dejah Thoris. Lynn Collins *is* Dejah Thoris, exactly as a dozen paperback cover artists have depicted her over the decades. Perfect casting. Her character has been updated in two ways to bring her more in line with 21st century sensibilities. First, she is as much a swordsman as Carter whereas in the books her weapon of choice was a dagger used to defend her honor against various miscreants. Second, she is depicted as a scientist here, a role her son played in the novels. Both changes were quite acceptable.<br /><br />4. Jumping ability. Hugely exaggerated over what Burroughs established in the novels. Not sure this was necessary but perhaps the producers were influenced by the success of the many superhero films of late.<br /><br />5. Barsoom. Perfectly depicted. Excellent use of CGI throughout. Quite impressed with the amount of Barsoomian visuals the producers were able to work in. It really had the correct \\"feel\\".<br /><br />6. The story. Very impressed with the amount of \\"Princess\\" that made it into the film. The entire framing sequence was retained. The 19th century setting was retained. The whole Thark/Tars Tarkas/Sola/Woola plot points survived.<br /><br />The \\"sword and planet\\" genre has been out of fashion for a long time now. It has always been something of a male juvenile genre which one had to be exposed to before age 15 to appreciate. The audience for this film probably died out long before the technology was available to bring to the screen. Those of us who survived to see it can be grateful that Disney brought it to the screen and it is to be regretted that they were not financially rewarded for their fine efforts. Highly recommended..

B007PT3QOQ|2.0|We've been playing this off and on for a couple of weeks, it's a fun game to play in small bursts (which is usually all I have).  I did a update download yesterday because it said I needed to to continue playing, and since then I can get one or two actions ususally and it completely freezes up.  Anyone else having this problem?  Any fixes?  Thanks.  Its a bummer, this game has been fun for me.

0380729407|3.0|This is a hard book to review, because for each thing great in this book, there is something terrible to off set it.  A book like this, I will give 3 stars because its somewhere in the middle, which is where I kept finding myself as I read.  Lets start with the good, because then, if you choose, you can stop reading after that.  The plot is great, the theme is really fun, the pacing is nice, and the ending is exciting.  Of the main characters I loved the Dad (who I consider the main protagonist and The Tattooed Man, who is the antagonist).  In fact, if you want to read a truely great piece of writing, read chapters 39-41.  The dad gives a great monologue about good vs. evil and has a really good match up against the forces of evil in this book.  I reread these chapters over and over and couldn't get enough of it.<br /><br />Now, the bad, unfortunately, the great characters stop at the two main ones, and all the supporting characters are all just fluffy paper cut outs with little or no impact on the story, and the WORST characters are the two boys Jim and Will, and unfortunately, you will be stuck with them throughout the story.  They have terrible dialogue, stupid sayings, and they don't act, talk, or do anything kid-like in the book.  In fact, I would say, that these two characters are among the worst written characters ever in a book I have read.  The other big con in this book is Bradbury's style of description.  Bradbury is just one of those writers that you either love or hate, because his style is so peculiar, you either embrace it, or you just can't stomach it.  I am in the latter circle, and have a hard time making it through his books.<br /><br />All in all, I think whether you like this novel or not, you will find yourself doing a fair amount of skimming, and for a book that is barely 300 pages long, that's not a good sign.

B009NQKPUW|1.0|Some movies just should never be made... this is one of them.<br /><br />This movie stands on the promise of awsome trailers (which by itself should indicate that it would not be worth it as now-a-days trailers actually are much better to watch than the movie that often don't even include the scenes in the trailer, or the scenes are so far apart that they convey a different message when they are packed together in the trailer than they would have in their movie positions) and the hint of Alien influences both of which are let down by the movie... there was no suspense driven by any of the potentially \\"creepy\\" scenes...<br /><br />This is clearly an establishment movie that extends future installments a possibility to become better but clearly they are seriously lacking in many areas.<br /><br />By the way, the inclusion of a Chrisian believer in the movie (the woman with the cross) shows just how lacking in understanding of religion that exists in the holywoodites these days in there full tilt effort to become anti-religion they often show a false faith ideology in their depictions. It would have been better had they made up a religious symbol that had no connection with any modern day religions cause Ridley Scott demonstrated just how bad things have become these days -- Even Frank Herbert of Dune did better at building the religious mythos around the pre-existing ideology -- oh yeah, he was a novelist and not a holywood type movie maker who are used to producing top billed B-Movies<br /><br />I rate this movie in the mid-B range.<br /><br />As to those seeking to buy, save your money and wait for wal-mart to include it in their $5 misc movie box.
B004B8RWX0|5.0|Love, Love, Love this show! I started watching Walking Dead in the 1st season, but I thought I missed the first two episodes and always wanted to \\"catch up\\" on it so to speak. So I bought the first two episodes of the 1st season (the 2nd episode I had already seen after viewing it), but didn't see the 1st one. Great TV Series to watch, you will be hooked, loved the main characters!! I recommend this show to watch-it's a \\"must see\\" if you love zombies!!! The 3rd season just started and I am up front and center every Sunday to see it!!!
B008M0NDOK|1.0|I was looking forward to gaming on this controller, because I didn't like playing on the touch screen whilst leveling in order and chaos online. but after the first hour of use was fine, but it now makes me lag so much so that makes my gaming experience unbearable. I was expecting more from apples first controller since i think mobile gaming has a bright future. but this controller sucks. especially for the price. on the bright side modern combat 3 doesn't seem to lag, but i was hoping to get all of my games working on the controller.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Game of Thrones, A Song of Ice and Fire, brings the reader to a wonderfully developed medieval world full of adventure and intrigue. Martin's characters are masterfully drawn and encapsulate the full range of human emotions. It has everything from magic, mystery, murder, love, heartbreak and treachery all woven into an exciting work of fiction. I honestly couldn't put it down until the wee hours of the morning.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I purchased this series based on other great reviews. I was quickly drawn in; the plot slowly unraveled but left you with too many questions to sit it down. After each part ended I was thankful that I had no down time in between, which makes purchasing all five books at once completely worth it. A unique perspective of a semi-dysotopian society and quite worth all the heartbreak I endured while reading.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Cloud Atlas is a remarkable literary achievement in the way David Mitchell channels, with incredible accuracy, the language and geographical scope of each time period. It seems as if the characters have written their own narration and dialogue. Mitchell weaves mystery, intrigue and the essence of time as it flows from one century to another connecting each with flawless ease. Cloud Atlas is a great read and really nice to read on my Kindle Fire.
B00866H7SS|5.0|Excellently written can't wait for the second . Thank you Silvia day.  Couldn't put it down Gideon and Eva are perfect
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wow, this is a series not to be missed. I am an avid science fiction reader, reading everything from hard to light science fiction and everything inbetween. Right from the beginning, Hugh Howey hooked me and I couldn't put it down until I finished all 6 episodes. It has secrets, suspense, action and a wide-reaching (and plausible) plot that keeps you guessing and wanting more. Highly recommended- great value (he should charge way more) and well-written. An instant sci-fi classic.

0156027321|1.0|This book proposes we choose between a good story and `dry yeastless factuality', the question then arises if the opposite of this would be Moist Yeasty Fallaciousness? And why exactly that would be the better of the two?<br /><br />Let me start by admitting that I loathe Martel's positivity, it comes across as a lithium induced bounciness that only just hides a humidly desperate yearning for significance. And oddly enough, if one takes the foreword seriously that is exactly what it is. There is much I detest about this book, but to be brief I'll just say this:<br /><br />Stories with twist ending are almost always devilishly tricky things to get right, more often than not the clever twist negates what has gone before. The Life of Pi sadly doesn't avoid this pitfall or seemingly even attempts to do so. Martel marches his story right into his own trap.  The deep message of his book is that we can decide what to believe and thus create our own reality. Fair enough, if one can stay five years old. Most of us grow up however and realise that the world is much richer in complexity and indifference than we ever expected. This makes Martel's idea a laughably silly and one dimensional proposition. One merely has to walk out of the upstairs window into a self created reality where gravity is on holiday to see how that little delusion pans out. Reality -like gravity- works whether we acknowledge it or not. The indifference of reality is as vast as that of heaven.<br /><br />In this stumbling twist Martel negates his early premise that this story will make us believe in god. Since he merely presents us not with god as he appears in religious texts, eg. As a the omnipotent creator of the universe who is REAL. But rather as a reduced version of god who is likely not real, but such a nice idea that we are better off to believe in him simply to find consolation (thereby skirting very close to Pascals chestnut). This insight is remarkable only insomuch as that it is a paper-thin argument that has managed to find such wide acceptance among the fans of armchair religion. In fact, I am amazed that so many believers would happily agree to reduce their god to just another `choice' on the Big Buffet of Beliefs.<br /><br />In his happy enthusiasm to present the reader with two choices: Belief in the `better story' or choose the `dry yeastless factuality' -what on earth does that really mean? - of the real event. Any reasonably able thinker would see that there are really numerous other choices to make, not just the two the author would like us to choose from. Among them, the fact that despite Martel's contempt for agnosticism it is actually a quite reasonable position to take and his volatile hate of `fence sitting' is a markedly biased and immature point of view. Another choice would be to explore the impact of religion in more depth than the airbrushed versions on display here.<br /><br />What of the choice to understand. The awe of understanding is by far superior to the awe of ignorance (as Douglas Adams put it). If Pi's story is a mundane one, then so be it. There are enough wonders to be enjoyed without garish embellishment to gild the lily.<br /><br />Furthermore, Martel states that belief and atheism both go as far as logic and reason would take them and then make the same leap of faith. This is demonstrably and patently false since atheism draws on thousands of years of human experience and evidence of gods non-existence, then simply takes one more step to conclude that he does not, in fact exist. Just like all the thousands of other gods we created. Believers, however start from the point of believe and then try to force experience and reason to fit their beliefs. A fools errand, since they invariably end up cherrypicking the bits of their religion that best suit reason and circumvents logic. Entirely not the same thing in any way whatsoever. The fact that Martel doesn't see -or worse, blithely ignores the universe size difference betweento two- places him firmly in the Deepak Chopra/ Alain de Button class of fuzzily muddled pseudo-intellectual showmen.<br /><br />In short, Life of Pi lies closer to The Da Vinci Code than concisely elegant fables like Old man and The Sea or Animal Farm.to two- places him firmly in the Deepak Chopra/ Alain de Button class of fuzzily muddled pseudo-intellectual showmen.<br /><br />In short, Life of Pi lies closer to The Da Vinci Code than concisely elegant fables like Old man and The Sea or Animal Farm.
B000NVIXFK|1.0|Was excited to hear this newer release.  Played it in my car and it was absolutely depressing.  Bitter lyrics and cup half empty point of view through out.  I'd be surprised if there wasn't any suicide reports from people listening to this album.  What were they thinking?  The songs are boring musically.  Not much tho't put into their musical creativity.  Rush needs to return to their roots.  Mind you, this is difficult coming from a Rush fan of so many years.
B004NOH9LW|5.0|Hereafter is a movie that encompasses the sensitivity and strong story line that Clint Eastwood is known for today.  Each character is so special in the film and Matt Damon, even though his looks are \\"young\\" has \\"age and intelligence\\" in his roles.  This was one of his best.  The first time I saw it, I couldn't quite catch everything, but the second time, it was brilliantly directed and played out.  A must see.

B009NQKXYK|5.0|Loved this damn movie!  If you're a fan of Alien and Aliens, then you'll probably enjoy this also.  The Amazon HD rental also has some cool bonus deleted scenes after the credits that personally I thought should have been left in the movie!  The HD rental is worth the $4.99 in my opinion.  Do it.
B00005N6KG|1.0|I have never written a review for a product before on Amazon but felt compelled to do so for these headphones as they have a major design flaw that needs to be addressed by Sony and that is such a major issue I would advise against buying them.<br /><br />Out of the box these sound great, very good for the price and comfortable in the ear. I have a problem with ear buds such as the iPod ones hurting my ears and do not have a problem with these.<br /><br />However, there is a big problem with these headphones. I have owned 2 pairs and they have both suffered from the same issue. After about 6 months use the connection in one ear goes. Shortly after the connection in the other ear goes. You can kind of wiggle the wire that goes into the headphone around to get the sound back, which suggests its the way wire goes into the headphone that is causing the problem. The wire goes in at the front and it looks like it wears thin after a while.<br /><br />I know these are only $9.99, but to have the same problem with 2 pairs suggests this is not an isolated incident. I would strongly advise against buying these as although they sound great out of the box, after prolonged use both pairs I have owned failed in the same way and are effectively junk after that.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Have you ever returned home from work or a shopping trip to find something not quite as you remembered when you left? \\"Did I leave the radio on?\\" \\"Wasn't that light turned off?\\" Those shades, had I opened them?\\" But you just shrug and whisper, \\"I must have forgotten.\\" And likely that is the case.  But, for Catherine/Cathy Bailey--heroine of the gripping British import INTO THE DARKEST CORNER--that response defies reality and stirs her deepest survival instincts. For London's Cathy Bailey of 2008, anything amiss--even discovery of a fork in the tray for the spoons--recalls the experience of a younger self known as Lancaster's Catherine Bailey in 2004, a woman who barely escaped death then at the hands of an obsessed former lover and tried to vanish through relocation while he served a short prison term. For Cathy now, every excursion from her flat only sets the stage for a fearful return as her psyche prepares for the eventual rendezvous with her tormentor she realizes must still lie ahead.<br /><br />In the hands of a less prepared and weaker writer, this theme might sound hackneyed and clich&eacute;d. How many [[ASIN:B00003CXA0 Fatal Attraction (Special Collector's Edition)]] rip-offs must we endure? In the hands of UK police intelligence analyst Elizabeth Haynes, however, this crime-fiction sub-genre has found its most competent storyteller with INTO THE DARKEST CORNER assuming its position in my view as the definitive \\"Fatal Attraction\\" novel.<br /><br />Our literature and film culture has been fascinated by the so-called \\"Fatal Attraction\\" theme ever since the film of that name became a global phenomenon in 1987. I've fancied myself something of an expert on this theme as someone who emerged as the poster boy for true-life fatal attractions due to the 1980 attempt on my life by a deranged former girlfriend and my subsequent appearance on numerous \\"Fatal Attraction\\"-themed reality shows, including Oprah, during the \\"Fatal Attraction\\" fanfare years. I finally wrote and published my memoir of this story in 2008 as [...] in an effort to present the definitive nonfiction fatal attraction tale. Now, I tip my hat to Haynes for her delivery of a flawless fictionalized psycho-thriller built upon that same, basic theme.<br /><br />It doesn't matter if the lead character is male or female. The elements remain the same: An obsessed former lover stalks and disrupts his or her life until the tormentor has only one option left for satisfaction--destroy the object of obsession. While most of these stories try to develop a theme of love-gone-wrong, however, Haynes has responsibly emphasized the true motivation driving the narcissists who populate the ranks of \\"Fatal Attraction\\" tale villains. They don't really comprehend love, but they cannot tolerate the loss of control that comes with rejection by the target of their affection.<br /><br />In her graphic, diary-style first-person exploration of Cathy Bailey's psychic evolution from post traumatic stress disorder victim into an empowered individual able to face her worst fears, Haynes also provides an uplifting message for those of us who remain fascinated for whatever reason with the elements of the iconic \\"Fatal Attraction\\" tale. No one else can help you, until you help yourself.

B006VC3LES|5.0|Roman Polanski's genius is questionable. Whether or not he does possess a certain cinematic genius is neither urgent or necessary to conclude. His body of work speaks for itself, his 1974 magnum opus speaks for its decade, reality in the face of theatricality, and for the sanctity of the cinema itself. Now although it is not completely justifiable to prove whether Polanski is or is not a genius, it is rather important to discuss the life of this idolized and wanted man. Roman Polanski was born in the year 1933 in Paris to Polish parents. When his mother and father were forced into concentration camps for being Jewish, Polanski was faced with the unmeasurable difficulty of surviving the Holocaust on his own. His Mother ultimately fell victim to the horrors of Auschwitz. If that's not enough, if you would so melodramatically, fast forward to the year of 1969. To the Summer Of Love. To the end of the small portion of Polanski's life he would later recall as the happiest he's ever had. He had a beautiful, talented, and adoring wife. Her name was Sharon Tate. The baby inside of her, she and Roman would never name. In August of 1969 the Manson Family laid slain to Sharon Tate and the baby inside of her, both terrorizing and taunting, the darkest chapter of Polanski's life was marooned with notoriety and fear. It was only a few years after the death of his wife where Roman would leave his mark on the world forever.<br /><br />Chinatown flows with a lavishly perfected Noir tone, and I should add here, the film is the Neo Noir archetype, the best of its kind and one of the best that Film Noir carries in its respective canon. Also, whenever one sets out to write about Chinatown, one cannot understate the delicacy, the supreme handling of pacing which is to be found in this particular film. Not before, and not since, has pacing been so well thought out, so marvelously calculated, and devilishly crafted.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway stand immortal in this film, bellowing through the tenement halls inside of every dirty city confined within every Noir film in rotation. If Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway stand luminous as Kings of their respective Kingdom, then John Huston stands apart; shrouded in darkness, transparent, eager, vicious, immediate. John Huston's 'Noah Cross' exists, alright, and the most dangerous thing about the 'Noah Cross's of the world is that the evil within them is otherwise ordinary, bottomless, and unstoppable. Robert Towne's script is simply impeccable. Flawless storytelling accompanied by snappy dialogue, and a climax that cuts deeper than that of documentary reality.<br /><br />But it is Polanski who is the true star of this picture. You can see him in every shot, peering in through the lens, and directly into your heart. You can taste him in every dry patch of dialogue, smell him in the midst of gun smoke, and fear him as the tension culminates into the wake of tragedy. It is there, in the tragedy, he dares you to hope for the best, he wants to feel safe because films make you feel comfortable. He takes the trust that he'd earned from the audience, and crushes it, oh, and he makes sure it stings. He makes sure it hurts. And in in the aftermath of the his final act, his final betrayal, the ultimate tragedy, he makes sure you can feel him. He leaves you in pain. He leaves you guilty in satisfaction. Knowing that tragedy is the most universal of luxuries, Polanski makes that perfectly clear, and for the first time, his voice is heard, his war cry. Coherent and horrifying.<br /><br />While Rosemary's Baby is my favorite Polanski film, Chinatown has always been a close second. Rosemary's Baby has also been selected by Criterion (along with other Polanski classics like Knife In The Water and Repulsion). While Rosemary's Baby has been given the care and respect it deserves with a stunning Blu Ray transfer by Criterion, Chinatown is in a sad state. A film this important should be treated as such.<br /><br />If you have never seen the film before, buy the Blu Ray. If you already own the DVD, there is no reason for you to upgrade. Wait until the Devil gets his due.
1451620829|5.0|This is a book written by Peter Criss. It documents his whole life, from a little lad banging on his moms pots to a grown man playing venues to millions. Makeup to Breakup is a no-holds-barred version of Peter Criss's experiences within and without a band. He tells it like it is, all of it. From growing up in Brooklyn to being a founding member of Kiss, and even his experiences around his hit song, \\"Beth\\". A shocking tell all story from one of the greatest drummers of our time.<br /><br />I have been a fan of Kiss's for as far back as I can remember. While I admit, it was Gene Simmons and his demon character that appealed to me most, I still enjoyed all of the original four members of the band. Paul with his bold, big voice, Ace with his coolness about him, and the Catman who's song Beth is the most beautiful rock ballad ever!  When I heard about a year ago that Peter Criss was writing a book I contacted Simon & Schuster about a copy. So you could say I was slightly excited. I always wondered what happened, why did he come and go so much, and why is two other guys in the band now??? Well, everything I ever wondered and more is in this book. Seriously. A couple of times I was floored by what I was reading 'cause I just had no idea.  What a journey they all have taken. Being part of something that will definitely go on forever, and with sharing gritty details of what seedy stardom is really all about, makes you crave even more. Crazy to think, but it's true.<br /><br />I think this is the kind of tell-all book that Kiss fans are either gonna love or hate. There will be no in-between with this, it's just too honest, and you'll either appreciate it or think he's bashing the band. Your call either way, but I don't believe that was his intention, just sayin'.
B000TXNDUW|5.0|Jean-Luc Godard intended to shake the delicate world of cinema, that much is obvious. But did he intend to reinvent it? Whether it was his intention or not isn't the point, the point is this; he did. Jean-Luc Godard, and Francois Truffuat are the undisputed fathers of the French New Wave. Some cinephiles or historians may feel like pointing elsewhere, to Jean Renoir for example, protesting that he is truly the father of the French New Wave, I disagree entirely. The French New Wave was a product of the kindred spirits and talents of Godard and Truffaut. And no other film represents the French New Wave more coherently than Jean-Luc Godard's dazzling 1960 picture, 'Breathless'. Unorthodox and uninhibited. Raw and experimental. Godard broke every rule in the book, disavowed the laws of cinema, and scribed a new rule book, one where the pages are blank, and possibilities are endless. The story is so simple I can summarize the entire film in half of a sentence, but I refuse to give you or Godard the satisfaction. What counts in Breathless is not the story, but how the story is told. The very definition of 'cool', the film is robust in creativity, and exuberant in its flaws, and passionate about its reckless behavior. Self aware and rebellious. If there was no Breathless, there would have been no Tarantino, if there was no French New Wave, the streak of genius that ran through the nineties and 2000s wouldn't have existed. Before Breathless, it was believed that films took money, that you had to find yourself in a place of authority to make a film. Breathless broke this misconception. Breathless makes you want to run outside and make the film of your life. Breathless made that possible, Breathless made the amateur the auteur, Breathless reinvented the face of the cinema, and made you believe that could too. All you need is a girl and gun.<br /><br />Criterion, as usual, have outdone themselves. Buy the discs, read the booklet, watch the feature and the features, and you'llbe a Breathless expert in no time!

B0076DCT2G|3.0|The Panther is the latest in a series of John Corey novels, and as always, his irreverence and no holds barred sense of humor is high gear.  The book is a quick read if you've read past exploits, and the plot does have its twists and turns, but somehow, I came away only partially sated.  A lot of pages were devoted to narrating the movements and plan development of Corey's group, and I began to feel impatient at times.  When the action started, it was short lived and somewhat predictable at times.  Where I really felt let down was the ending.  Corey and party were in a hostile environment, largely devoid of allies, and next thing you know, they're back in the USA.  I was really hoping Nelson Demille would deal with all the intrigue, but alas, the book ended.  I really enjoyed Lion's Game and The Lion.  Unfortunately The Panther did not create the excitement for me that the others did.

B000000OY9|3.0|Neil Young's 18th studio album \\"Landing On Water\\", isn't what you would call a classic, far from it, but i've always enjoyed some of these collected tracks as in, the electronic \\"Weight Of The World\\", \\"Hippie Dream\\", is a 60's tale with 80's synths, \\"Touch The Night\\", is a heavy rocker with then modern beats.  I'd recommend these tracks  for your i-pod, but i own the cd, and just listen to those tracks.  This album was produced by Danny Kortchmar (session guitarist in the 70's) and a member of the 60's folk-comedy group The Fugs.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|As a long time fan of Ken Follett's work, I was thrilled to see a trilogy available.  The characters he developes over the course of the three books are so well known to me that I feel as though they  are good friends and dreaded enemies. His tale is rich with the history of WWII and the socio-economic changes that it wrought.  I would recommend this book - indeed all three- to anyone who enjoys historical novels.
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|This is absolutely my new favorite album!  When I heard them on youtube, I was blown away and was counting down the days until the release of this album.  They do an amazing job of merging styles and genres of music together.  I wish them all the success in the world.
B008I3QZKU|2.0|It hurts me to give the \\"I've been a fan for xyz\\" preamble of cliches, so I'll keep it brief: I had never, prior to hearing Battle Born, heard a Killers song I disliked, and I had heard them all.  Now I have to concede that a little under a fifth of the catalog is painfully mediocre, which is a pretty significant blemish on a previously perfect career.  The biggest problems with this record have been well reported in both professional and customer reviews, however, they merit repeating.  [1] With the notable exception of Runaways the lyrics are clumsy and unpoetic, often socially conservative, and overwrought with the same Vegas and religious imagry that used to be on some level endearing but is now just exhausting; [2] the music is a rambling cluster of uninspired and riffless 80s power ballads with really nothing memorable to be said for them (excluding Runaways, Flesh and Bone, and the title track Battle Born, which I thought were great).<br /><br />Okay, that rant was more for me than for you, but there it is.  Honestly (and sadly) Flower's solo album, which at the time I thought \\"man, am I glad this is not an official Killers album\\", was the stronger record BY FAR.<br /><br />FIN.

B008Y5OW20|2.0|Jeff Lynne, Beatle wanna-be, or more aptly, dreamy Paul McCartney impersonator, founding member of ELO, and known as Otis \\"Clayton\\" Wilbury, of the famed Traveling Wilbury's, has delivered unto us a bit of nostalgia based warm tea, enriched with several dashes of oh-so-sweet cream to help it all go down that much easier.<br /><br />To be honest, Long Wave was given to me by a dear loved one, someone whom I admire and respect with all my heart, which is much more than I dare say for this release ... and hope I've not offended my most kind friend.  Long Wave is a mere shadow of the believable work Kevin Spacey did for his movie \\"Beyond The Sea.\\"  Long Wave, is filled with snappy pre-Beatle classics, packaged for aging hipsters like myself, and that younger crowd who may recognize Jeff Lynne's name, smile, and make one of those cash register impulse buys, padding their order with a double latte, newspaper and those cool thin cigarettes that won't give you cancer or offend those around you.  Sadly Long Wave is not snappy or cool, and it is a bit offensive, as the album which coincides with his release Mr. Blue Sky: The Very Best of Electric Light Orchestra, though in reality is merely a group of ELO songs re-recorded by Mr. Lynne, and feels for all the world like nothing more than commercial product, lacking vision, strength, and a willingness to present anything significant, or bring anything new to the table.  What we do have on Long Wave are eleven, two to a package, deep chocolate Tastykakes wrapped in spoil proof cellophane, that will have you walking up in the morning, wrappers stuck to your forehead, wondering what you'd gotten yourself into ... and feeling very guilty, as you stuff the disc beneath your mattress with the other porno.<br /><br />If self indulgence is what you're after, then Long Wave will fill all of your guilty pleasures and remind you of the tender voice, backed by those unmistakable ELO rock orchestral maneuvers, from a man we've heard little of in the past few years.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Keslerof in the past few years.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesler
B009329ZF2|5.0|If you enjoyed the Transformers movies you will also enjoy Battleship!  I love a movie to have a fast theme, packed with action.

B00979CS50|5.0|Neil Young began this psychedelic saga while rambling through his past in search of material for his book \\"Waging Heavy Peace,\\" a book that's both compelling, labored, and more disjointed than one can imagine; though if one considers the six decades that make up the musical career of Mr. Young ... this is about as straight forward as you ever gonna get.<br /><br />Psychedelic Pill [and I remember many of them fondly], opens with the track \\"Driftin' Back,\\" a swirling hypnotic number that's nearly twenty-eight minutes in length, and is sure to curl the edges of mouth, creating a mile wide smile as the acid memories kick in.  Neil Young, along with his on-again off-again band Crazy Horse sonically drift through the vaults, lifting old and creating new musical riffs that are so magically charged you'll have no other recourse than to drift back, letting your head ride just above the water line, wondering where the years have gone.  If you weren't part of the original psychedelic scene, then this is your chance to stand with the sun at your back, cast your own stars across the heavens, get lost in the paisley wanderlust that was 1969, and slip sideways into guitar driven chords that build slowly into blossoms, then flowering into a thick reverb drenched masterpiece.<br /><br />The album is unqualified storytelling brilliance, a taste of something I'd nearly forgotten.  Psychedelic Pill is epic, self assured, connecting the past and the present like a thought that hangs in the air a moment too long, almost long enough to reach out and touch, and then it's gone.  Psychedelic Pill reminds me that I have people I haven't seen in far to long, that my years haven't been wasted, and that this is truly the strangest life I've ever known.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesler

B0064NTZQ2|3.0|I bought this movie earlier this year.  However, it is only recently that I have been driven to take the time to write a review of it.  I loaned the DVD to my best friend and we discussed it afterwards.  That discussion is what drove me to write this review.<br /><br />This is one of those \\"atmosphere\\" movies, in my view.  The atmosphere in the scenes sort of took the attention away from the characters and the plot.  Especially that very last scene, after the kid's confrontation with the mobster.  And that need to emphasize the atmosphere also made the movie slow-moving.<br /><br />The main character is a mysterious young man who makes his living doing stunt work for cheap movies.  On the side, he moonlights as a criminal who transports people in exchange for cash.  Sort of like the Frank Martin character in the Transporter franchise.  But make no mistake.  This is a much darker, much more violent movie than the Transporter trilogy.<br /><br />The driver is a loner, living alone, speaking only to those he must.  You get the impression that he has experienced a lot of trauma.  There is a sadness about him, but also confidence.  He's one of those people that carries a lot of pain with him.  Trouble starts when he opens the emotional door and makes friends with his neighbor, a young woman living alone with her young son.  As he spends time with them, he becomes attach to them.  Later, the woman's husband completes his prison sentence and comes back to live with them.  The driver ends up becoming friends with Gabriel, the husband.  Unfortunately for them, Gabriel's old associates are not finished with him.  To help the family, the driver agrees to help Gabriel pull off a robbery.  And talk about a robbery gone bad!<br /><br />The movie stars Ryan Gosling, Carrie Mulligan, Albert Brooks, and Ron Pearlman.  This is one movie where the acting is beyond reproach.  Gosling reaffirms his position as one of Hollywood's rising stars.  And Albert Brooks, in an atypical role for him, plays his nemesis.  The movie would rate as over-the-top in violence.  Action is pretty good.  The driving scenes are done very well.  This is not Ryan Gosling's best work, but it is pretty good.  Be forewarned that this is not anything like the Transporter movies.  This one is very violent.  Much too violent than it needs to be, in my opinion.  It does try too hard to make the driver larger than life.  In a way, this makes him somewhat unrealistic or implausible in a non-human way.  He reminds me of Lt. Martin Castillo in the Miami Vice television series.him, plays his nemesis.

B003PIS5XI|5.0|My family and I love this movie and we wore out our VHS tape recently.  When everything is so uncertain it's nice to be able to watch something that can make you laugh and smile, and not have to worry about language or sexual content.  The price was terrific, the packaging was very adequate, and it arrived just as promised.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I heard about this book from a friend from California who picked it up thinking it might be a story about hiking. Outdoor adventures are her passion. But, she said she was disheartened when the beginning of the story talked about her mother's death. The irony is that she's been meditating on her own mother's death which happened when she was 9 years old. The death has affected her entire emotional and spiritual life. She continued reading and ended up recommending it to me as I consider my own mother's and father's recent deaths.<br /><br />It was an incredible memoir and I am so happy that I decided to read it. I recommend it for anyone who likes to read non-fiction and is interested in emotional and spiritual growth regardless of their individual journeys.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|It not bad and better than what i had. It made it possible to download slide show presntations on my tablet
0385535147|2.0|I tried to get into this book and based on some of the author's better works I stuck with it up to page 203. After that, I got tired of waiting for the \\"plot\\" to take off...in my opinion, it didn't happen. The characters seemed lifeless...they just came in and went out. Perhaps after writing so many novels, the same themes just come up, only with different titles. I would not recommend this book...Sorry.

B008JF8O9M|1.0|Tried using this with several different programs. Simply didn't work.  I returned my hd7 and bought a nexus 7.  Much better support for printing.  Hope they fix this with update 7.2.1.  Found out after return that google print would have probably worked with my hp 6500a plus.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|I loved the special effects in this movie! Wow, wow, wow..... I really appreciated the juxtaposition of modern filmmaking to this classic tale, very believable!
B00902MCVY|2.0|With the incredible hype surrounding this album of 6 years in the making, I went in with as little expectation as possible. I hoped for the minimum, something at least as good as Wintersun's debut self title. With only a touch more than 25 min of actual metal songs with few guitar solos and little emphasis on guitarwork, the album leaves me unsatisfied especially compared to the length of this album. There is only 1 guitar solo, and you wait 33 min to get to it. It then only lasts 30 seconds and doesn't blow you away. However, this album while not blowing me away certainly isn't terrible either. It is worth a listen, but do not expect this to sound much like Wintersun's debut. I never have the urge to turn it off, and it does grow on you as you hear it a few times. However, many times I feel like I missed a section so I go back and find that I missed nothing at all. The same couldn't be said about their debut. 7 min into Wintersun I am more satisfied as a metalhead than I am listening to all of Time I. Track 2, Winter Madness has more guitar work than all of Time I with an excellent chill inducing 1 minute solo.<br /><br />For listening to this album, I used two setups to listen to the album several times on each:<br />Main Setup: Lilith Audio Player ASIO -> E-MU 0404 USB -> Mini^3 Amp -> BeyerDynamic DT990 250 ohm<br />Casual Setup: Foobar2000 -> Syba SD-CM-UAD USB -> Sennheiser HD555<br /><br />For the audiophile, the sound quality is excellent. Everything is well mastered and instruments and vocals are balanced nicely without one taking over and drowning out the other.<br /><br />Drums are the overall star here. Having seen Kai Hato filling in for Kreator's drummer live less than 30 days ago, this is no surprise as his drumming skills are to put it simply, beast. They for me are the most interesting part of the album. The other aspects, the synth aspects while fun and create a beautiful grand and majestic atmosphere, become monotonous at times and leave me wishing for more variation. Too much repetition for too long without enough change. If more Bach influence had made its way into the synth work, this album would have risen to a whole different level. Or instead of more synths at times, simply more solid guitarwork would have been better. There is only so many times bells really need to heard.<br /><br />When Time Fades Away is a great intro for the album. It sets the mood and general pace to expect, bringing in some interesting Japanese influence using likely a Zither and/or Shamisen to create peaceful aw-inspiring imagery of falling cherry blossoms while surrounded by a serene body of water. However, these Japanese influences are not to be heard much again other than briefly in the very beginning of the first epic track until the final epic track, Time. It is quite a shame as hearing Wintersun describe Time I over the last year especially left me expecting a bit more influence than what was found in the good but ultimately throwaway intro and then the repeating similar sound later in the album very sparsely. More varied uses of the Japanese strings, more than simply one Japanese inspired melody would have been interesting and worthwhile. There is a loss in potential in not utilizing the Zither much more through the album. I expected it more present in the main track of this album, Sons of Winter and Stars.<br /><br />Sons of Winter and Stars is an excellent passionate, though not quite a masterpiece, track that stands out and sent a few chills through my body. The background vocals that are introduced at 1:20 are unexpected, a choir voice reminiscent of almost heavenly latin influences. It serves as contrast with the harsh vocals that are introduced moments later. With more Japanese influenced strings just seconds ago this was not what I thought I'ld hear so early on, but it worked well enough and adds to the atmosphere. However, this is nearly the last heard of it. At 5:18 in or so, things become astral. Sounds of space ships and flash back inducing stereo effects. Clearly this is what was intended. This is the moment in the album where you have now reached space. At times the synths act awkward and some odd choices arise, such as why a tambourine was bothered to be included when so much is already going on symphonic wise. The use of trumpet in this song is okay. Reminds me much of Turisas, but executed just a little lesser. However, there's 8 min left to the song. I feel at about the 7 min mark, the song could have ended. Instead, it goes acoustic for a bit and then into what I'll look at as phase 2 of the song. This phase of the song reminds me greatly of Ensiferum, especially when they add the guitar back in a few min later at almost the 10 min mark and start giving us some guitarwork that is craved. It has that storybook feel that Ensiferum does well.<br /><br />The middle tracks before the final epic track are just okay. They showcase the softer side of Wintersun and have a certain warmth that's admirable to hear, but given the plenty of lulls in Sons of Winter and Stars, it isn't necessary to give the listener such a break from the intensity that is sought from melodic death. I have a hard time calling either of these tracks very metal, they are not complex enough and are more similar to symphonic hard rock. After hearing it a few times, there isn't much more to discover or find. It becomes boring. If Sons of Winter and Stars didn't end at the end and instead built into Land of Snow and Sorrow continuing on with the album building back into the intensity typical of melodic death, much more could have been achieved- not taking a break when the momentum was just getting started. The power influences are mildly interesting, but like Ensiferum's Iron it is not Wintersun's forte. Utilizing the violin better in this track and really carrying a strong melody could have at least given something to truly come back for. Five min into Land of Snow and Sorrow and I'm ready for it to end, but it doesn't. It continues on for a few more min, but nothing really noteworthy is heard beyond a couple minutes of a melodic guitar repeating the same melody a few times ultimately feeling like too little too late. It is possible that with these two tracks, the Japanese string instruments are being used. However, because of the use of the synth as well it does not sound much different than an acoustical guitar. Darkness and Frost's following acoustical interlude only confuses this further.  By the end of Land of Snow and Sorrow you are quite peaceful and the track ends very quietly. More slow and lightness isn't necessary, not unless the final epic song is going to be such a major contrast that could be the only possible reason for this lightness.<br /><br />However it isn't. The final track Time is tame in general, spending more time with bells and pretty synth sounds than serious guitar and drumwork. The first minute of the song is not bad, but then the lead guitar disappears until several more minutes in for a brief moment before giving way to bells and synths once more. The heavy use of synths throughout the album is not necessarily a negative, however the lack of variation in the synths ends up with them feeling repetitive. The only solo of the album takes place 6 min in that lasts exactly 30 seconds. It's a solid solo, but nothing spectacular. Certainly not long enough and great enough to have waited 33 min for a solo. This last track musically really ends at 9:15. It somehow goes on for a couple minutes longer with more Japanese inspired strings that ties in with the intro for an attempt at coming full circle. This last Japanese inspired segment isn't really needed, the short piano solo that preceded this last out segment was actually a surprise. More of pianowork would have been well received throughout this final track.<br /><br />With a great amount of effort and time, Wintersun has produced a unique album with Time I. It's more of an intro to a great album than a great album on its own. With only two metal tracks, it leaves great expectations for Time II to pick up the slack Time I created and further develop their sophomore album. Time does fade away in this album, waiting and waiting for interesting moments.
0525952926|5.0|I consider myself well read, I read at least one book every week. It's my way to escape and relax. That being said there are plenty of times where I finish a book and say, \\"that was not great and I wish I hadn't started\\". There are times when I read a good book and say \\"wow that was good\\". But, there are few times when I say \\"that was excellent\\", my only problem is not wanting the book to end. Kudos, to Ken Follet.<br /><br />Read Fall of the Giants first, that is the first book in his series. It took me a few chapters to start remembering the characters and where Fall of the Giants left off. But after the first few chapters I was reading every moment I could.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|If you are at all remotely interested in Tier 1 units or Special Ops in general, but this book right now. I've read most of the books in this genre out there and this is the best in my opinion thus far. This guy literally shot Bin Laden's sorry a$$ and took the photos of the body that we will no doubt be seen by the entire world in a few years. Serious page turner. Hard to go to bed on time with a book like this.

The history is accurate with loyal Americans and disloyal Americans who are commie spies all of whom developed their beliefs in the 1930's in east cost elite universities. Will the loyal Americans save the country's space technology from destruction or will the commies win out and dominate the world? A great read, you won't be able to put it down!

B0071XO8RA|4.0|Okay, this turned out to be a pleasant surprise. I found this to be an entertaining read in the 3.5-4 star range. Other than having an amazing first name, Howey managed to find a way to make the usual, post appocalyptic scenarios fresh even using old themes.<br /><br />Best of all, is the world building, which, followed a lot of \\"tropes\\" yet, managed to be different than what I expected, in a good way. The ladders, stairwells, pipe and cable filled passageways of the \\"Silos\\" reminded me of life aboard ship while I was in the Navy. What would it be like to have to live on something the size of an aircraft carrier and farm out basic rations to the point of an almost socialist all for one, and one for all mentality. Barter for goods and being angry as hell at Supply...the cheap bastards... not to mention IT, the devil in any machine these days. Silo life had a very unique feel as a basis for the world where a story is set and the characters live. It shouldn't, there's nothing new about living on space ships and under domes (ala-Logan's Run) but some how, it seemed new here.<br /><br />I also like the semi-capitalist-semi-socialist-semi-democratic-semi-oligargaical (if that's a word) society. There is a lot of life mirrored in these stories. Stratified society based on class, colour (of uniform) and skill sets. The dark facination with \\"Cleanings\\" and the fact that Howey didn't stop with the \\"You damned bloody Apes, you burned it up!\\" story theme, taking it a step further.<br /><br />The characters were hit or miss, I liked Knox, I liked Julliette (more on her later) I liked the crazy old man in the small workshop in Mechanical, and the major villain. The Sad but strangely sweet story between the mayor and sheriff brought the sting of a tear to my usually grumpy eyes...of course it was kind of dusty that day!... and the sad story of the \\"old Sheriff\\" and his demise turned out to be a real heartbreaker too. I wasn't so keen on the Juliette's love interest and I thought the New-new sheriff (after Julliette) got short shifted, since he became so pivitol.<br /><br />Plot wise, I'd have liked to see more of a connection between Solo and Shirely and the gang in Mechanical. Many of those were billed to have a huge role in Juliette's life yet, got too little \\"airtime\\" to see it.<br /><br />The best character was Juliette. Strong woman, pretty, able to love, old enough to know better, with a very practical sense of hope and strength that simply put, said, \\"you live just one day at a time, no more, no less. Get done what needs to be done today, let tomorrow's jobs be done tomorrow.\\" mentality and a \\"just put one foot in front of the other\\" sense of courage that carried her through her adventures in Silo 18. She could be physical (a fighter) the way Howey wrote her, but, instead, she thought problems out, like a mechanic or a carpenter, then went to work to solve the problem and get the thing running...what ever it is.<br /><br />The villain was suitably villainous too. A good bad guy who had a bit part, but was written well into it.<br /><br />The short comings in plot and some of the characters is off set, in my opinion, by one thing. No matter how glum things got, how desparate, how depressing, all of the major characters found something to hold on to, some sense of hope. They didn't long to live outside, rather, then longed to make the lives that they have work so they can be happy when they get the chance. No whining about the outside, but plenty of hope for the future in an otherwise bleak and hopeless setting.<br /><br />That's just good stuff. Happyness isn't a state of mind, you have to build an environment that it can bloom in, when it's time for happiness to bloom.<br /><br />Good book<br /><br />Warnings, violence, but generally, nothing that YA to OA readers couldn't enjoy.

B00005QIPH|5.0|I've had this CD for a few weeks now and I've already worn it out! I've always been a Strokes fan, but have been more into their mainstream songs that I hear on the radio. I bought Is This It to check out some tracks I had never heard. I can't believe what I've been missing! Every song on this CD is amazing! Each song has catchy guitar riffs, the bass is incredible, and I can totally relate to a lot of the songs based on the lyrics. I highly recommend it!

1439127700|5.0|How do men who have been President of the United States of America spend their time in retirement? One of the possibilities is that they take an active role in the Presidents Club (the Club). In their book unsurprisingly titled 'The Presidents Club', Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy give an account of the Club's activities and how it behaved from President Truman's close relationship with ex-president Hoover to the present era of President Obama. The club is small due to the scarcity of retired presidents. Bill Clinton had the support of one of the largest with access to Nixon,Ford,Carter,Reagan and G.H.W Bush. This Club is completely informal in that meetings are at the whim of the incumbent president who usually sees members individually. There are no rules or regulations generally associated with clubs and societies.<br /><br />It is clear that the overriding function of the Club is the preservation and enhancement of the office of the Presidency. This explains how retired presidents can operate with the President of the day despite differences in political persuasion and personal likes or dislikes. The authors examine the critical issues that bedevilled each president and how the Club participated or otherwise in their resolution. The help ranged from providing a sounding-board for a lonely man to carrying out major projects with critical international sensitivities. In this regard one has only to read how ex-president Jimmy Carter saw his resonsibilities.<br /><br />This book is emminently readable,exciting in parts and written as you would expect from two editors at 'Time'. It also has strong academic credentials with an impressive research foundation. It is a beautiful example of accessible modern history. It is interesting that there is no discussion regarding the place of the Club, which has no electoral or other mandate, within the democratic proccess. In parliamentary systems there is nothing so past as a past prime minister. They tend to languish in retirement some destined for oblivion.<br /><br />Everyone with the slightest interest in American politics should read this book. It is redolent with the atmosphere of power. To outsiders the American political system is something of a mystery and this book is a fascinating account of a little known piece of this complex jigsaw. Long live the Presidents Club!

B006HL9G10|5.0|I am using this app on my HTC Flyer and have had no problems with it. Figuring out how to use it was not very difficult even though there were no directions (I am a middle aged woman who does not use very many apps). The sound of the bells is pleasant, even though I keep the volume very low because the first time I used it the bell made me jump! I always had good intentions to meditate but was not doing it very often and I feel that the insight timer has made meditating easier, especially in the mornings before work because I don't have to peek at the clock or wonder what time it is. I have set several different preset lengths of time and intervals depending on how much time I have, I pick one, and I can get right to it. I really like the journal option. I use it to set down a few words about what happened the night before, how I'm feeling, and any breakthroughs (or Ah-hah's!) I feel I've made. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to meditate more. I also really like the little map showing who else in the world is meditating and I find that I always check to see before I leave the app. It is inspirational somehow.

B005EGXTEE|4.0|I did find the premise of this book very similar to the Japanese movie, [[ASIN:B007MJSYF0 Battle Royale]], so am a bit surprised about its success. But then again, I was surprised by Harry Potter too as that is very similar to [[ASIN:0141319623 The Worst Witch]] - but you can't say that franchise wasn't successful!  Anyway, this is well written and at least seems to be fairly original in the world of print, so I would give it a look. However, if you want something more original, either because you've seen the film (or Battle Royale!)  or because something doesn't really appeal to you here, I would try [[ASIN:0812550706 Ender's Game (Ender, Book 1)]] or [[ASIN:B009KVBC20 Into The Trees]] by J. Alastair Nash

BRAVO DEB!!!!!!
B008QE9XD2|5.0|While others have offered the storyline aplenty, I wanted to add how Eva Green (remember her skewering of 007 in Casino Royale when they first meet on the train?) demonstrates how a beautiful woman can still be sexy even with her clothes kept on. Her chemistry with Johnny Depp is great, and the two of them are just pure entertainment - she as the witch (Angelique) who still wants to have sex with Barnabas: the man she's been tormenting for 200 years.

B008HK3S9K|5.0|Timbuk2 brand items have always well been well made, in my experience. This Kindle Fire case is very protective and sturdy. It is also compact and best of all, attractive. It has a double Velcro closure and quilted, padded body to protect the device. The lining is a very soft velvety faux fur like material. I have posted pics in the picture section. It fits my Kindle 2 perfect.  The color of the one I received is slightly different.  It does not have the signature Timbuk2 stripe going down the middle. Instead, the body of the front is all floral and the back and flap is ballistic mulberry.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I was hoping for so much more from Rowling.  This book left me shaking my head in disbelief.  It was sad and depressing and so british that I didnt understand some of it.  Sorry JK, but you should have stayed with the genre you were so successful with...get back the magic!

B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is a novel that will define modern adulthood. It is an amazing story of genuine growing up and hardships of reality. If not one of the greatest books a person can read, it should be on the bucket list of novels to experience.

B004P4S4NM|5.0|I just love this mp3 CD!!  Chock block full of great songs..  Adele21 is worth the purchase. You won't be disappointed.
B00979CS50|4.0|Okay, let's see, we've had Are You Passionate, Greendale, Prairie Wind, Living With War, Chrome Dreams 2, Fork In The Road, Le Noise, and Americana. Let's face it, with my own personal exception of Fork In The Road and maybe Living With War, from the preceding list of albums, the last decade has been pretty slim pickings for die-hard Neil fans. But Psychedelic Pill offers new hope that Neil is righting the ship and returning to what he knows and does best with this new album. That doesn't mean that I want him to simply regurgitate the same stuff over and over. It's just that his heart didn't seem to be into it on so many of his recent releases. But everything about Psychedelic Pill seems right. Unlike those previous efforts, there are lots of great new songs here, even a few that rival his best material. The songs, the production, the 'let's just plug in and play' feel of it, all seem right to me. And unlike recent efforts that I played once, maybe twice, and then put back on the shelf, this is an album I will play over and over. I don't need Neil to make another After The Goldrush or Rust Never Sleeps, I just wanna hear him sounding great and revelling in what he does best: being Neil.

I'm glad I did because it is a fantastic book! My knowledge of KISS Is very limited and all I knew beforehand was that Peter Criss and Ace are no longer in the band, so I went into this book with a blank canvas. Peter Criss is not an author, he's a drummer, but he tells a damn good story. This book was eye-opening and honest and an incredible read. I liked it so much I wrote a review of it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it is such a fun game. I was looking at all the free apps and came across this one. I figured I might as well try it out so I did. I didn't think it would be this fun though!!!
B00913DPW2|1.0|the door does not open no clues to help you out the game should have been better made than this or thought of better. I would not spend not even a penny on this game when it goes on sale so I tell you out there do not waste your time on this game

0385535147|5.0|While John Grisham may have a formula, it's one that I count on and love. He starts out with an underdog who's underestimated and always wins in the end, which is of course, that he stops being a lawyer.  haha.<br /><br />But seriously, I'm not giving away the plot because the story starts out with a forty-something, African-American lawyer who's spent the last five years of his life in a 'club-med' prison for white collar offenders.  Malcom is too smart to serve all 10 years of his sentence, and when a local supreme court judge is murdered, along with his secretary, guess who has the answer as to who-done-it?  Certainly not the federal government, the ones responsible for ruining Malcom's life with trumped up charges of racketeering.<br /><br />How Malcom beats the government drones at their own game is both awe-inspiring and hilarious.  Everything seemed pretty cut and dry in the middle of the book and I found myself ready to relax my break-neck speed-reading marathon, but of course this is John Grisham, master story teller, and when he throws a new hook in the story, I find myself once again unable to put the book down.<br /><br />I love how Grisham's hero's come alive in his stories. These are real people with all their strengths and foibles, totally relateable and sympathetic.  Another thing I love, is learning about the life of lawyers, and in The Racketeer, I learned way too much about what it would be like to be in prison.  I have to wonder if Grisham had himself locked up for a few months to be able to write so realistically about our hell-hole of a prison system.<br /><br />But my favorite thing about Grisham's novels, is his compassion for the underdog.  Too often those in power take advantage of those without power.  Grisham's novels at least point that fact out, and then show us ways to even the scales so to speak.<br /><br />The Racketeer is another fascinating romp through the legal world, this time showing how the government that was put in place to protect us, can sometimes be our worst enemy.  Grisham once again writes the perfect book for a long airplane ride, beach or anywhere when you need some fun escapism.  He's never disappointed me yet.protect us, can sometimes be our worst enemy.

B009CPJHY4|5.0|A beautiful story that depicts the unpredictable trials of aging with a few couples.  Of course, the survivors are characters who know themselves to be courageous and reliant on themselves and not their \\"worldly\\" possessions.  A reminder that who we are internally is always more powerful than \\"what we have.\\"  Beautifully done on all levels!  Dench is a master-work alone!
B006N57PXG|5.0|Do yourself a favor and buy all four right off the bat. You're going to want to read all of them as soon as you get into this one. Bartimaeus is a wonderful dynamic character that will leave you wanting more. I've had a hard time fining other books of this caliber. Good for older teens through adults.
B0061JPT46|5.0|{Amazon Verified Purchase)This album was originally named The Beatles Again,and hard to find.Amazon.com came thru for me again. As Ive said before,The original studio recording is always the best recording.This is the album that Hey Jude and Revolution were released on.I may be wrong on this, But I think this album is the one after or before The White Album. There is no release year on the album or the cd.This cd is a japan release. The words are in english and japanese on the insert. The quality is good as the original. Just think you can learn how to speak japanese by buying this cd.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I have seen the movie version numerous times since I was a Child of 8 years old I am now 69 years old and I enjoyed reading it for the First time. Walt Disney studios did a fab job on the picture but  it can not hold a candle to the Original book. Robert Louis Stevenson was a sublime author and I love his stories. I could visualize the scenery and settings as I read it is wonderful.
B00110K3BY|4.0|(Amazon Verified Purchase)This is a good buy,It has two of his best albums on one cd.If your a Frank Zappa fan you will enjoy this cd.If you are not a fan,but looking for something different try this cd.There is nothen political correct about Zappa.I think he is good at what he does.If I had to compare him to a style,I would say he is the Jeff Foxworthy,Bill Engvall of rock-n-roll.I will admit he is not for everyone,but again he might make you smile with his humor about our society.Another CD I would recommend is Frank Zappa Have I Offended Someone? this is sorta a greatest hit cd.
B00138CXZI|4.0|Nice music, mostly my \\"favorites\\" and a few to become fav soon.  She sings with the great attitude that she loves it and gets paid for doing it too.  Love the preview of MP3 albums no waiting for music to arrive.  All music should come this way.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|For the price... it was a fantastic game. Long play with plenty to do. Lots of I spy puzzles as well as other solve-it puzzles. Helpful little hint button if you get stuck or not sure where to go next. Game played fantastic on my Kindle. Looking forward to the next part!

0345803507|3.0|I really enjoyed the first two book in this series and couldn't wait to read this one.  I had heard several people say this was the worst of the three but I went in with an open mind.  Unfortunately, I have to agree with them.<br /><br />In the first two books, I was immediately engrossed in the story.  But in this book, there are a couple of flashbacks which I think just threw the book off.  And I never completely got into it.  Another thing I had heard people complain about was that Ana was so repetitive with all of her thoughts.  I never really was bothered by them until this book.  If I had to read one more \\"oh my poor Fifty\\", I might have screamed.<br /><br />A lot happened in this book.  I felt like the author was trying to cram a bunch of things in and wrap up the trilogy all in one.  Now don't get my wrong.  I still enjoyed reading the story.  But just nowhere as much as the other ones.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Although I am an avid reader, this storyline did not sound like something I would care for despite the best seller status. However, the movie debut did spark my interest so I rented it to satisfy my curiosity and was, of course, captivated by the plight of Katniss. I knew the book had to be better than the movie and I was not disappointed! Now, I can't wait to read the other books in the series. The story was well written and I couldn't put it down as it was just that good!
B0021L8V1Q|3.0|Seems like less action & more talk than the first one. Mickey Rourke was good though. Worth watching, but not the beat super hero flick.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Kept my interest throughout the entire continuation of the books. Would recommend this series for a good read for sure!
0812550706|5.0|One of my favorites of all time, and I'm not a general sci-fi fan. I first read this book a decade ago and continue to go back to it. It's become a Christmas gift for my nieces and nephews as they become old enough to appreciate it. There are scenes in books (and movies) that become etched in your memory, the kind that send a thrill down your spine, and \\"Ender's Game\\" has one of the greatest. (No spoilers here.) Ender and Bean are two amazing characters, and their friendship is part of what makes this story so enduring.

1451662432|4.0|I was weaned on the giants of the `80s action movies: Stallone, Seagal, Van Damme, Lundgren and of course, Schwarzenegger. I can in fact remember the first time I saw an Arnie film, when my babysitter decided to put on The Terminator and at a pre-school age, I was confronted with the sight of this behemoth of a man, carving a path of carnage through LA. From then on in, I was a fan.<br />When Total Recall: My Unbelievably True Life Story the autobiography of Arnold Schwarzenegger landed on my doormat, I felt like a kid at Christmas!<br /><br />The life story of Arnold Schwarzenegger is truly remarkable. In his own words, \\"...what are the odds... for an Austrian farm boy to come to America and become the greatest bodybuilding champion of all time, to get in the movie business, marry a Kennedy, and then get elected governor of the biggest state of the United States...\\"<br />From that brief quotation, the reader can see there is certainly plenty of material for him to cover and this is demonstrated by the fact that you're halfway through the book before any real discussion of The Terminator: a movie that was made almost 30 years ago.<br /><br />At times, I was laughing uncontrollably at some of the stories in this book and most of the time, I couldn't help but read it and hear his voice in your head! Although much of what is narrated in the book is already well-known, getting Schwarzenegger's version of events is compelling, hearing about his childhood in Austria, his will to succeed in bodybuilding, how Conan the Barbarian brought him international stardom, how he was determined to succeed as Chairman of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports; and many other tales that leave you wondering how one man at the age of 65 years old could fit so much into one lifetime.<br /><br />Arnold comes across as incredibly driven, highly competitive and quite calculating, sometimes to the point where I found myself losing a bit of respect for him. His psychological toying with other athletes on and off the stage were not what I would expect from a modern athlete but then again, Schwarzenegger really was a game-changer as far as the bodybuilding world was concerned.<br /><br />As the book progressed, I was worried that he would simply ignore the subject of his lovechild but in fact, my fears were allayed late on in the book. Despite this, he skirts over his own failings and misdemeanours such as affairs, alleged sexual harassment, drug use and steroid abuse. This may be understandable, given that Arnold is still a high profile individual, a role model to many and a man who still hopes that he can save his marriage to Maria Shriver.<br /><br />The section on Arnie's time in politics will not be to everyone's taste, especially those who are more interested in his bodybuilding and/or movie career. At times, it can be very dry and overly-descriptive about political processes; but it is also not without its highpoints and is peppered with references and anecdotes about famous politicians and celebrities alike. Schwarzenegger freely admits many of the mistakes he made while in office as the Governor of California but is keen to point out that he gave it his absolute all, just like every other career decision he has made.<br /><br />For me, as a fan, I don't regret reading this book. Much of the information contained therein is already common knowledge but the facts and circumstances that are already known are brought to life with Schwarzenegger's own stories and thoughts on events. The title of the book however, is only partly true; the latter half being correct in that yes, it is indeed an \\"unbelievably true life story\\"; but the title \\"Total Recall\\" is quite the misnomer, since I cannot help but feel much has been omitted deliberately from this book.<br />Ultimately, this book is much like the man himself: entertaining, larger than life, charismatic and unforgettable; but not without its flaws.ying with other athletes on and off the stage were not what I would expect from a modern athlete but then again, Schwarzenegger really was a game-changer as far as the bodybuilding world was concerned.<br /><br />As the book progressed, I was worried that he would simply ignore the subject of his lovechild but in fact, my fears were allayed late on in the book.

B007CKB2AS|5.0|Bruce Springsteen is a true reporter of the national situation.  Downloading the Wrecking Ball was quick and flawless, Amazon MP3 and the Cloud Drive are super.  The music is clear and easy to listen to.  It helped to have the additional video that has the words to all the songs.  Being from Central Michigan, I can relate to what Springsteen is singing about.  The Boss Has It Right!
B000FO0AOC|5.0|You have heard his great voice before but probably never realized it was him. His music has been covered by everyone in many different genres but there is only one Otis Redding. Great album for anyone who has a slight interested in his music because it has his great hits and new discoveries.

B008673ZAQ|1.0|I enjoyed book one and really counted down to the release of this book. Man this book sucked. It was such a pain to read. I only kept going in the hopes of something happening and nothing did. No character development only regression. Eva was so annoyingly clingh I would've dumped her too. Gideon is just a douche bag to the extreme...womanizing man who're turned murderer. In real life real women would run far the heck away and fast. Who thinks abuse attempted sleep raping and murderer is love? Ms. Day really seriously dropped the ball this boom. Save your money!
0385535147|5.0|One of the key ingredients of a Grisham book is the author's ability to immediately capture the reader and involve him or her in the proceedings.  The Racketeer is no different than any of his others have been.  There is the need to look askance at a less than believable plot, but in spite of the necessity to accept non logical events it is a captivating read.  Malcolm Bannister is an attorney caught up in a crime in which his physical presence causes him to be found guilty and sent to prison for 10 years.  It looks like in spite of his innocence he will have to serve the sentence and leave prison with his life ruined by the Federal government, his wife divorcing him, and no way to earn a living as a practicing lawyer.<br />  In the fifth year of his sentence,  Raymond Fawcett  a Federal Judge and his girl friend are killed and the safe in the Judge's house found open and emptied.  Malcolm knows who did it and negotiates with the government for his release and entrance into the witness protection program in return for information leading to the killer.  With the negotiation successful and ensuing events unfolding Grisham spins a tangled web with twists and turns that keep the reader going on with the book.  Predicting the ending is almost impossible, but within the realm of what is happening is logical, and rewarding.  Like his other books The Racketeer is not easy to put down, and it is possible for the reader to go along with the considerably less than logical sequence of events.

0553801473|2.0|I will not forgive GRRM for not killing off Cersei in some horrible way. IF this series goes on long enough, if I live long enough to see it happen, maybe Tommen will grow up and  realize what a treacherous bitch his mother is and have her beheaded for trying to harm Margery. The only reasons I read this book were to find out what happened to Bran, the true lord of Winterfell, and to find out how Cersei died.  SOL on both counts.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I'll admit, the first time I played Settlers of Catan, I wasn't that impressed. I had friends that liked to play it though, so I played a couple more times. By then I was hooked! My husband and I love this game and have hooked several of our friends and family! We even play a lot just the two of us using some of the modified 2 Player rules online. I'd strongly recommend this game to anyone who likes fast-paced strategy games.
B00913DPW2|1.0|I wish this game didn't require information about my network.  I love ghost stories and ghost story games.  I would have grabbed this in a heartbeat if it wasn't for the invasive, unsafe, and unnecessary permissions.  Way to go developers.  I would have even been likely to buy it if I liked the graphics and storyline description...  if not for the permissions.  Because of the invasive permissions, you not only lost me downloading this game, but you lost me probably EVER downloading one of your games.  It might not be a big deal to lose a single sale, but there are a lot of others who think like me who also won't buy your games.

B000FCKGPC|4.0|One star lower than the other 3 only because it's slightly slower moving than book 1 through 3.  But you visit new locations so it's great.<br />And I'm only half way through so I might be changing the rating.
0312360258|5.0|MARKED  PC CAST<br />Here's another teenaged vampire angst story. Zoe Redbird is marked for rebirth. Seeking escape from her present life with a holier than thou step father and a boyfriend who doesn't get that they are so over; being marked seems like a sign albeit a confusing one. Marked is the first book in the House of Night series. Zoe and her third year fellow fledgelings go up against an egotistical leader of the Daughters of Darkness. Zoe discovers she has some skills that are closely akin to her Cherokee roots.  Teenage vampires still have the same issues as mortal teens like boys and peer pressure.<br />I was not at all sure whether I would like the book due the falsely sparkling vampires of other stories.  I was willing to keep an open mind and I am glad I did. Despite the supernatural nature of the book I was enthralled with the subject matter and could not put it down until the last page.  I give kudos to the author for writing real characters that young adults can deal with -sure the other vampire stories of a paranormal nature show the Hollywood romantic side but this had grit and showed the reader that the heroine had to face the real possibility of death of her body rejected the changes or the chance that the group of vampires would attack her. There is honor and bravery along with love and loyalty in this story.<br />Definitely a five star read.
B005LAIHYU|3.0|Abraham Lincoln is portrayed in the film as having a secret identity as a vampire hunter. The story finds Abe set on a path of vengeance when he sees his mother killed by a Vampire. As he studies the law and tries to win the heart of Mary Todd by day, the nights find him seriously throwing down with an unending army of the undead. When he discovers the plot of a master vampire to conquer the United States, he makes the decision to take up a life of politics, as well. The rest, as we know it, is history.<br /><br />Giving as I've read the book by Seth Grahame-Smith, I expected alot out of this film. Like the book, I expected the film to be played with all seriousness and, for the most part, it was. The movie, unfortunately, wasn't the same as the book(as we all know they rarely are). What's surprising to me is the fact that Smith wrote the screenplay for the movie. I'll admit, the film is well-acted and quite entertaining for a period film. The special effects are spectacular. However, just something about the movie didn't feel quite right to me. To be brutally honest, I enjoyed Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies alot more. Something about that movie seemed more feasible to me.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this movie was well-made and I enjoyed watching it. As far as whether I thought it was an outstanding movie to watch...well, it was okay to me. I do recommend it, though.

I am writing regarding the quality of the physical book, The Mark of Athena, itself. I didn't notice until I was about half way through the book, but it looks like the book was torn in half on the inside binding. I paid enough for the book to receive it in one piece, and I'm just hoping that it will stay together until I get to the end. It is the only book I have received from Amazon in such condition, but it is very disappointing.

The movie talked about how the CD was a best seller in South Africa, but it was a black market CD, and Mr. Rodriguez did not get any of the money. The pice was good and I am very happy that Mr. Rodriguez will be getting something for his work. The song \\"Sugar Man,\\" should of been a hit in the United States. Music has a short limited little window.We can miss out on good vibes.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|So when it comes to some game headsets you can go only two way in my opinion. Either you can go to turtle beach or Tritton. Then we can either choose from wireless and wired. In my opinion you have to go wired because some wireless headsets while good because its wireless, does have some lag-time because of wireless connection. Turtle beaches are great and was actually my first REAL gaming headsets that i got. They were great because of the ease of instillation and the mic that it comes with is super clear, not to mention the clear sound. However I changed the console that i played on ( because of my playing preference ) and when i switched i found that turtle beaches weren't compatible with my other device. I changed over to some Tritton's because like you i heard great things about both , the Tritton definitely had a way better look to them. Not only that but the headset worked both on the gaming sets that i had. If you are a solid gamer and dont plan to change systems than i would have to say that turtle beaches are the way to go . Thay in my opinion have a better sound, not because of the speakers but because of the headset themselves that cut a ton of outside noise. However if you have two systems and you play both i would day Tritton, no only do they look great but they are more affordable than Turtle Beaches.<br /><br />In any Case Both are Great But the decision is what kind of gamer are you

0812992784|5.0|There are so many things wrong with my title sentence that I hardly know where to begin. It is a quote from the Wikipedia article on The Satanic Verses, Rushdie's 1989 novel that became the focal point of the great conflict.<br /><br />I was completely engrossed by this nonfiction account of Salman Rushdie's years in hiding. This mild mannered writer, relatively unknown outside of literary circles, even after winning the 1981Booker Prize for Midnight's Children, was sentenced to death for writing a book, The Satanic Verses, in a fatwa by the dying Ayatollah Khomeni. Mr. Rushdie was demonized by many thousands of outraged Muslims, those tireless defenders of the religion of peace, witness to the banning and burning of his book and his own effigy, and the falling away of many ostensibly liberal western authors, some of whom used to be his friends. He persevered in living and writing, and obtained the best revenge.<br /><br />The fatwa stated that it was the duty of Muslims everywhere to kill Salman Rushdie, for writing a book which the Ayatollah thought was insulting to Islam (it was not actually about Islam, but never mind that). The British government assigned a special police squad to protect him, and he was a virtual prisoner for years, moving from one secret place to another, having limited contact with family and friends, denied public appearances, and even the further publication of his book, because people had a genuine fear of violence from even a distant association with the man or his book. This was not an example of that oxymoronic term islamophobia, because Islamic terrorists killed several people, bombed bookstores, and publically proclaimed the murder of an author as a sacred religious duty. It is telling to recall that in 1989 this was still shocking to the western world. At a Muslim youth conference in Bradford a 16 year old girl called for Rushdie to be stoned to death. The singer formerly known as Cat Stevens agreed that Rushdie \\"must be killed.\\" Several luminaries in literature and members of parliament stated that it was Rushdie's own fault for offending Muslims, because he should have known that they would respond with violence.<br /><br />Mr. Rushdie writes with a practiced and winning style, showing a wide ranging intellect, and a convincing command of language. The choice of the third person to narrate an autobiography is unusual, and it creates some distance from the author and his subject, distance that works here, because the tale is an emotional one, but he tells it with a sure and even hand. Sometimes he seems excessively defensive, taking great efforts to explain how a remark or a slight offended him, and I began to suspect that I might not like the man if I met him in person. Nevertheless, he has been the recipient of extended public abuse, which was arbitrary and unjustifiable. In his situation, I would be defensive too.<br /><br />This might qualify as a cautionary tale, but of the wrong kind. Great Britain and the west have progressed further along the road to capitulation in the face of violence from offended Muslim extremists, aided and abetted by those who used to champion freedom. We have learned little from the sad tale of Mr. Rushdie, which is greatly to our peril. All around the world, our freedoms are under attack.veral luminaries in literature and members of parliament stated that it was Rushdie's own fault for offending Muslims, because he should have known that they would respond with violence.<br /><br />Mr. Rushdie writes with a practiced and winning style, showing a wide ranging intellect, and a convincing command of language.

B004HW7JH4|4.0|On his ubiquitous commentaries for the DVD set of season 5 of MAD MEN, the series creator Matt Weiner repeatedly says the theme for the season was \\"Every man for himself\\"; however, this season of the show is for once dominated much more heavily by the women than it is by the men. Very few of the major male characters (including Don Draper) are in as proactive positions as they have been in past seasons, and instead we see the women as making the more dominant choices in the season, from Betty's long-deferred decision about advancing her career opportunities, to Joan's unexpected choices about what to do with her career and her marriage, and to the many surprising choices of Don's beautiful new bride Megan (Jessica Pare) to settle into married life. Don's ex-wife Betty is of course here again too, and makes some decisions of her own about getting her own life after her unhappiness at seeing her husband get remarried (which results in January Jones wearing prosthetics to make her seem quite fat, partially to cover the actress's real-life pregnancy), and the most dominant minor characters are two formidable mothers-in-law, Betty's (played by Pamela Dunlap--a favorite from last season), and Don's (played by Julia Ormond).<br /><br />\\"Why do [women] get to make all of the decisions?,\\" Pete Campbell whines about his flirtation with the depressed bride of a fellow commuter. The answer, as this season seems to show, is that the men seem incapable by this point in the series of making their lives happen: all of their agency seems to have been drained away, not just by the onslaught of the real events of 1966 (the ongoing civil rights struggles, the mass murders of Richard Speck and Charles Whitman, the youth movement), but by their own inabilities to take command. Repeatedly the men in the show are seen at a real crossroads, watching their own rare decisions turn sour (as Lane Pryce does, in the series' most tragic subplot). Certainly this was not what would have been predicted for the path for this show to take when the show started, when the women were mostly trying to carve whatever small space they could in a Manhattan and suburban world dominated by greedy and ambitious men. But one of the best things about this series has consistently been its inability to remain stale: it keeps moving in different directions, and Don's new marriage to Megan (and their fabulous high-rise apartment) really takes this season in a new direction. The acting, like the writing, is, as usual, consistently high: Jon Hamm and Megan Pare do well with the biggest roles of the season, but they're nearly outshone by Christina Hendricks and Jared Harris, who are given here more than they've ever had to do before.<br /><br />This DVD set comes with better packaging than the last few, although some of the special features seem pretty superfluous: a history of Daylight's Saving Time seemed unnecessary, and the mini-profile of the painter Giorgio Di Chirico (which is here because he inspired the season's unremarkable poster) also doesn't seem terribly essential. The commentaries are always great, although Matt Weiner always dominates whichever ones he shares; still, since he knows more about the show than anyone else, this seems fair.

B003PGNBO8|4.0|Ok, so this is an interesting series with great characters played well and a well written show.  I had purchased the first half of this series back when it first came out and was a little miffed that the second half wasn't made available.  So, recently I started to rewatch the first half and decided that it was good enough to go ahead and buy the complete season.  I still think that the second half should have been made availble, but what can you do?  I have to know what happens and how it all ends.

0316228532|3.0|Having done a lot of work with foster kids and families in situations like the Weedon's I appreciated J.K. Rowling using her influence and writing to shed light on the complexities of this subject. And I also found the interactions between the teenageers and parents in this book interesting. About halfway through the book it got interesting with the ghost and as the ending came to a head the reader is interested to see if it will end as they suspect but other than those moments it is dull and depressing. Rowling does a good job describing people and situations but somehow the characters and events are not compelling enough. There is no easy solution to poverty, addiction, prejudice, or teenage angst and so the reader knows the book will not provide solutions to the key problems highlighted in the book. And so the reader is left feeling depressed at the parent-teen relationships (which are all bad to terrible in this book) and at the poverty, addiction, and prejudice. The book is useful in shedding light on this subject for those who are naive or not already familiar with the complexities of these issues but for those already daily familiar with these topics, it provides no satisfaction at all. So I both congratulate Rowling for her courage to tackle this subject and have to admit to not really enjoying the book all that much as I pushed myself to finish it.<br /><br />I realize that there is a lot of darkness in the Harry Potter series but it is balanced with likeable characters, some fun times, and magic which makes the books balanced and still fun to read while grappling with important topics. This book has none of that so you are left with a lot of depressing topics with no light. I found it disturbing and unbalanced that there is not a single good relationship between a parent and their child in this book. I appreciate shedding light on the difficult subjects but the lack of any positive is also unrealistic and made it hard to relate to the characters.<br /><br/>(and I did not cry at the end nearly as much as I did at key points in the Harry Potter series because I did not feel connected to the impacted characters in the same way and I was ready for the book to end at that point. Kind of the way you aren't sad when Anna Karenina ends because you are relieved to finally end the long-winded second half of that novel.)
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Very additive game!  I didn't think I'd get into this...but it quickly became an easy time killer.  It was also fun to see how quickly i could waste coins by tapping away.  The only thing that's weird is that the coins don't really fall like you'd expect... I mean coins that landed on it's edge would remain standing even after being pushed.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|The Matryoshka doll aspect of the novel was an intriguing device, but the different styles of storytelling in each \\"doll\\" was the most fun.

B002PEP4SC|5.0|Fast-paced, action-packed, a well developed storyline and characterization. I'm looking forward to reading the 2nd book in the Nikki Heat series!<br />I enjoy reading James Patterson, Lisa Gardner, Colleen McCullough, Nelson DeMille among others.

B0033807C2|5.0|Percy Jackson and the Last Olympian is the final instalment in the great Percy Jackson series. I have enjoyed this series a great deal and will no doubt read the other Rick Riordan series. My feelings were that each book in the series was better than the one before, I suspect that this could be due to my growing familiarity with the characters. When I read, I try not to over-analyse it too much. My reasons for reading are not to dissect the book and look for faults, but rather to take it at face value and get into the story that's being told.<br /><br />The crisis is at a climax. The final instalment of the series' overarching story, the survival of Olympus, is the focus of this book. By the time we get to this one there are loads of sub-plots which have been introduced in other books along the way. I found that in some parts it was a bit tricky to remember all of the sub-plot details. But, with a bit of brain power and memory jogging it wasn't really too hard to keep track of everything. Riordan did a great job of tidying up all of these storylines.<br /><br />During the book before this one I had formed some definite opinions on who I couldn't trust, but as I'm no Sherlock Holmes, my mystery solving weakness showed up and some of them ended up being wrong. I had also formed an opinion of Nico in the previous book (I didn't like him - I don't really know why) and even with the outcome of his story, I still didn't like him. Most of the characters were great to get to know, they each had their own story which evolved and climaxed along the way. One thing though, I didn't really 'get' what Percy's mum's new friend Paul added to the story, or why he was even in there - maybe I missed something. I guess it's these sorts of personal reactions to books and their characters that make books so interesting. Each reader is free to form their own opinion and interpretation. In a nutshell, the main aim of books is to entertain and provide an escape from our daily lives, the PJ series was successful in enabling this to happen.<br /><br />I would recommend the whole Percy Jackson series to readers who love adventure and action. It has some great humour threaded through it that makes it so relatable to our own modern world.series was successful in enabling this to happen.<br /><br />I would recommend the whole Percy Jackson series to readers who love adventure and action.

1582701709|1.0|This book is awful.  I love this line from the TV series the X files: \\"The best place to put a lie is between two truths.\\"  This book takes some deep truths and then shoots them full of lies from the pits of darkness.<br /><br />Like this truth that has been said many ways throughout the ages: \\"Your thoughts are important to your experience of life/ What you concentrate on and envision impacts where you go.\\" Those ideas turn into this gem on page 99, \\"The only reason any person does not have enough money is because they are blocking money from coming to them with their thoughts.\\"<br /><br />Somebody has got to ask,\\"what work does this kind of thinking do in an individual's life and then in the world through that individual?\\"  \\"The secret\\" takes truths meant throughout time to liberate humanity and then twists them so that these truths are now lies that cause people to lose compassion, humanity, and wisdom.  This twisting binds up humanity in self accusation that spreads to accusation and incrimination of others, lack of concern and lack of compassion.  Sad dangerous stuff.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Too long winded, with no real action until the end.  The end itself was over the top with Reacher killing 21 people in half an hour.  Also, the Agatha Christie ending with Reacher explaining what was really going on. Most of Lee Child's novels I would rate five, but not this one.

B009HV2JT8|4.0|I can tell you for sure that this movie is certainly better than Abraham Lincoln vs. the Zombies. This movies special effects and movie quality are comparable to Sherlock Holmes. This movie also has a small amount of scenes that drag. Overall, it is very entertaining and it was great to see the historical figure in a would be vampire action film. It's worth the viewing and the purchase. This movie has some great action scenes, especially the ones where Abe uses that famous cherry tree ax to take out vampires.<br /><br />If you're looking to see a movie that is really very well written and keeps you engrossed from start to finish, definitely get this movie. Also, I did not purchase the HD version but regular Amazon instant video and the movie is still amazing!<br /><br />Final thoughts, this is really just a great movie with great actors. A must see for honest Abe fans!
B006LR0XLM|4.0|This became my choice to transfer files and photos between tablets. Once understood, it was simple and worked. My only problem was trying to transfer an app to an SD card in another tablet. The receiving tablet did not allow app transfers (a product mis-design) so the transfer seemed to work until I tried to access the transfer app, which could not be found. Dropbox is an overall good solution to keeping my tablets in sync.

1451695195|1.0|Lots of research ongoing regarding those who believe in \\"supernatural\\" events and those who are skeptics.  One recent study did MRIs of subjects who were presented with a story line and photographs; it seems the \\"skeptics\\" all shared something in common, a function of the right brain that inhibited the reaction of the non-skeptics (whose right brain functions did not \\"light up\\" when presented with the same data).  So, what comes first: the chicken, or the egg?<br /><br />A book about \\"heaven\\" written by an M.D. - let alone a neurosurgeon?  How many copies do you think this will sell (if properly publicized)?  A million?  A hundred thousand?  Okay, to be conservative:  forty thousand.  Is this book self published?  Hell, no.

Then he repeatedly presents the \\"truth\\" told him by a mysterious \\"woman\\" he (at one point) refers to as a \\"guardian angel) that \\"you can do no wrong.\\"  Um....really?<br /><br />What is the PURPOSE of personhood if the \\"person\\" has no recollection of having lived it?  What is the purpose of life, itself, in fact, if \\"you can do no wrong\\" and apparently (according to this book) your entire life can be forgotten as if it never existed?  Does this make \\"Om\\" (oh, excuse me, the \\"Core\\") a game player of the highest proportion or perhaps some raving maniac who subjects life forms to constant torture, disappointment, abandonment, suffering, loss, confusion, illness, accident, death....for no reason other than its own hidden agenda which works within a conundrum of hundreds of other \\"dimensions\\" (where life forms far more sophisticated exist....one wonders how he knew that when he didn't know what he, himself, was)?<br /><br />Discernment. Remember the Liar has many faces.
B000ID37T0|5.0|This is my favorite Al Pacino performance to date! You get to see the classic Pacino, fiery and intense. In contrast you see a more tender side in this portrayal of a blind and troubled veteran who has lost his faith in humanity and himself. Playing opposite is an innocent and honorable Chris O'Donnell as Charlie Sims who has found himself in the center of controversy back at his prep school. Together, both characters are set on a painful path to self discovery. I laughed, I cried and I enjoyed this movie at every turn. Amazing and wonderful!!

B00866H7SS|5.0|Fabulous book, if you love fifty shade, this is even better. Love Gideon, what a man, can't wait for the next book
B000BCE918|5.0|I have been a dinofan since my earliest recollection and that goes back about 50 years at least.  These 3 movies are the epitome of technology and the acting is also top-notch.  Anyone who enjoys dino movies will certainly be enthralled by these masterpieces!
B001706I5I|5.0|i brought this movie for our daughter's birthday. our granddaughter basely took it over and loves<br />watching it all the time. i thought the grinich might have scared her (shes only 2-1/2 yrs old)<br />but shes loves it.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I have to say that I am addicted to this couple!  Sylvia Day has done a great job bringing the reader into the lives of this couple.  I have a difficult time putting the book down.  Very entertaining book series!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I really enjoyed this book it really took me by surprise! I didn't want to put it down! I have just started the second book and its even better!
030758836X|5.0|I picked this book up on a hunch and a small amount of buzz on the internet. Bought it at Target for 30% off during my lunch break two and a half days ago. Finished it last night despite having to read by candle light because of the power outage. I was floored by the story and couldn't stop reading it. I haven't felt this way since I finished the Millennium. Even if I had electricity right now, I would have still read the book as much as I did. I had no clue who's side to be on either. For pretty much the entire book. I strongly suggest reading this book.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|This movie was beyond expectations. Very intriguing and very scifi. I loved this movie and can watch this over and over.
B009QW6ZT8|5.0|Great episode! A little more gore this season! The story continues though. They are in the prison and meet some interesting characters!
0375703764|5.0|This is most likely the first experimental novel I've ever read, and it was amazing; truly a book worth coveting I don't recommend reading much on the story as to avoid spoilers but I found it enthralling and highly entertaining.<br /><br />I definitely recommend picking it up, though it's pretty long, it's definitely worth reading.
B0041C09Y0|5.0|i must say that i am pretty impressed on how this show kept me entertained and wanting to see more! this is the first time that i watch this show and I'm glad that amazon allows you to view through most of the seasons! if you like a story line that's filled with drama, mafia/gang related show with lots of gun action, sons of anarchy is a great show to watch!!  i can not wait to get to season 2 already!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Fantastic movie collection for anyone who appreciates the classic gangster genre.  Of course, in Blu-ray, this movie is better than before and will remain one of the best collections to own.
B008602KQI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie when I saw it in the theatres and I had to buy it as soon as it came out on DVD.  There aren't many book to film adaptations I love but I can count this one in.  It's an above average movie adapted from a great novel.  Read the book, watch the movie!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This standing case does all it is made to do. It protects my Kindle Fire HD 7 very well. I really like the way the stand part holdes the Kindel at the right angle for great viewing. Love the purple!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this battery ap has alot of features that make it surpass  the other aps at least the battery ones,excellent ap
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The first two \\"books\\" were kind of slow but by 3 it was so good I couldn't put it down until I finished the whole thing.  I would love to see this made into a movie.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Great book with typical John Corey action and dialog<br />Can't wait for next book in this series.<br />Nelson DeMille has a hit.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|a good continuation of an enthralling series.  More characters, more plot and more story.  I am pacing myself so that I hopefully don't have to wait too long since this is to be an 8 book series.
B000W22NOW|5.0|In 1983,Curt Smith and his \\"Partner In Rhyme\\" Roland Orzabal started Tears For Fears,the name coming from a phrase used in Scream Therapy,and issued The Hurting,with 3 45's,\\"Mad World\\",\\"Pale Shelter\\" and \\"Change\\"..MTV picked up on the three Singles,and turned them into Big Stars,all this before their Magnum Opus \\"Songs From the Big Chair\\"! This edition Reprises that Lp,then adds 5 more Bonuses,such as Extended Versions of the Aforementioned,plus a B-Side that never appeared on any Album! Truly,the Genesis of the guys!
B009VLX8FS|2.0|This album is a morass of songs that are airlessly produced and virtually indistinguishable from each other.  The production is so pristine that it removes the spontaneity, joy and acoustic touches of her previous releases.  That hermetically-sealed quality does no favors to songs that plod by characterlessly.  I say all of this as a huge fan of \\"Speak Now\\", which offered personality and singalong hooks even when the songs weren't great.  This album is totally resistible. It seems to go on forever, and with the sole exceptions of \\"Sad, Tragic, Beautiful\\" and \\"Begin Again,\\" no songs seem to warrant the lavish production or running time expended on them.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Rowling let you see a small English town, its politics, people and problems from the inside out.  I think in the same style as the Harry Potter series (detailed, a bit dark) - only written for a decidedly adult audience.  Interesting the way she linked together the fates of seemingly unrelated lives, demonstrating the profound effect that their past and present situations, beliefs and actions had on others around them;  intended or not.  Somewhat depressing, a little slow in the beginning, then I wound up trying to stay awake one night to finish it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is the best game ever.<br />it is the best game ever because<br />you can kill a creeper.<br />buy minecraft now.

B006KX3GXO|4.0|using this app is quite easy and convenient. no issues with the app or its compatibility with my kindle fire.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|This is the best spook show I have seen in a long time & I am 72 years young. Have had the oppotunity to visit many of the places where the show is filmed as my son lives in Georgia. It just does not get any better than that. Wish we could find where the prison is located.
B001JI72AI|5.0|I have seen this movie many times before; it's become a favorite. Even with that, it never fails to keep me glued to the screen. It's well-paced, exciting and true to the history. I would recommend it to anyone -- especially families -- for a wonderful evening's entertainment.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a fun Windows-style solitare game, the graphics are neat with lots of options for customization. The worst part is the video ads, but all the ads are skippable.
B0098460O4|5.0|You will not regret ordering your own copy -<br />I am listening the 2nd times now (back to back)<br />and I am so moved by their beautiful voices.<br />Definitely touches my soul ~ Love Love Love this!!<br />Can't wait for more! You go, Kids!!!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app does not work very well on Kindle.  I am only able to view limited timeline status on this app.  All activity from the day before can not be viewed.
B004WKH4PS|5.0|She had to work like hell to get the part of Mildred Pierce in the first place. Joan Crawford was forty years old when she auditioned for the part at Warner Brothers studio. Many in Hollywood thought she was over- the- hill, washed up, too old to carry a picture. Back at MGM studios, where she had worked for eighteen years, they thought her best performances were behind her when they canned her. \\"They\\" were all wrong. Crawford proved them wrong.<br /><br />  In Mildred Pierce, Joan Crawford delivered the performance of her career. In this sometime-soppy melodrama, Crawford inhabits this character to emote her martyrdom as the long suffering, single, working Mom to her ungrateful & sociopathic daughter, Vida. Crawford still looks beautiful in this film, a gifted actress at the peak of her talent & body of work.<br /><br />  Joan Crawford won an Oscar for best actress in a leading role for her part in this film. Delicious dialogue, costumes, & set's, take you back in time to 1945. A must-see true classic. One of the most iconic & memorable movies from the golden age of Hollywood.
B00913DPW2|5.0|I loved this game it was so fun I love it it is like you what to stop playing but you cant.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was quite refreshing to learn about how to care for curly hair and to learn about all the different curl types, in more detail than I have seen, even on you tube. This is a must for all curly girls even African American (of which I am)
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait to read book three and see movie for this book. Couldn't put it down and thrilled with the ending. On to book three.:)
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I saw some of the removed scenes on youtube.<br />What is wrong with Hollywood?<br />I think if a movie has to be 3 hours long, it has to be 3 hours long.  Is it the theaters who request 1.5 hour movies?  Prometheus was running a bit long, so they just had to cut some scenes?  So, after you want the movie, go watch the scenes that were cut out.  There is no way I was not going to have seen this movie, at that point you are glad that you rented the movie instead of at the theater.<br />You think some weasel does not go up to the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" folks and says,  \\"hey , can you cut it back to 1.5 hours?  Come on, how about 2 hours?  You are killing us!  How about  2 hours and 15 minutes?\\"
B002MG0MF8|5.0|Loved this movie. First saw it back when I was 7 and now nearly 23 years later it is still just as good as ever.
B0060AY85C|3.0|I read this book after reading Faulkner's \\"As I Lay Dying\\".  Both were about poor people in the South, but Faulkner's book was a masterpiece, intertwining humor with deep sadness, while Morrison's book is just plain depressing.  She makes her point, but I didn't enjoy reading it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I have the original Angry Birds as well as Angry Birds Seasons.  Angry Birds Rio (Ad-Free), is the best of the three.  The graphics are much better than the other two, very colorful.  I have had to play the same level several times just to catch every detail. This one is also the most challenging of the three. It is also very nice not to have ads interrupting your game.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved this book.  The main story is sad and tragic (set in Nazi Germany), but the individual characters and sub-plots are intriguing and gripping.  The narrator tells the story from a very interesting perspective...one I had never come across before.  I have recommended this book to many friends, and already bought two copies to give as Christmas presents.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was hooked by about page 3.  I picked it up as a Kindle daily deal a month or two ago figuring I could take a flyer on it.  What a steal.  Once I started it I lost some sleep.  A great story, well paced, well written, good characters, all around great.  I'm about to recommend it to all my friends.
B002NUULNG|3.0|The new version, \\"2.0\\" looks great but if you want to watch the original, it's not even remastered at all. It's just an upscale of the DVD version.
034580404X|1.0|No wonder downloading is so popular. It kept me back from buying. In my country downloading from an illegal source is legal. enough said. And I really really really prefer to pay a fair price for the book. Any author has a right to be recompensed. When I say fair price I do mean fair price and not the ripoff that is offered at the moment.
034580404X|5.0|This is an awesome read I couldn't put it down. I reccomend this series to everyone over the age of 18.
B005HIREJK|5.0|Amazon delivered again. It was breeze searching for and finding the watch I needed. The watch is of outstanding quality, excellent design and it was offered at a great price. I couldn't ask for more. The item was delivered ahead of the stated schedule. I was impressed all around, especially with the extra value provided to me for free shipping as an Amazon Prime member.
0553582038|4.0|I'm a big fan of the A Song of Ice and Fire series, but I always take a long time getting through the books. I had been putting A Feast For Crows off for that exact reason. I knew that once I began, I wouldn't be able to read anything else for another couple of months. And guess what? That's exactly what ended up happening!<br /><br />A Feast for Crows is the least regarded entry in the series. I think it's an unfair reputation though. Along with A Dance with Dragons, A Feast for Crows is one super long entry in the series. It contains half of the characters you're familiar with (the other half being in A Dance with Dragons) and a few new ones to get acquainted with. There's the problem: unless you're a huge fan of Cersei, Jamie, Sansa (who is?), or Brienne, you're stuck. Favorites like Jon, Tyrion, and others aren't given time at all. So it's understandable that fans would be frustrated. Instead of waiting five years to find out what happened to Tyrion, fans have had to wait eleven.<br /><br />But that doesn't mean A Feast For Crows isn't a good book. I enjoyed it quite a bit. The writing is just as quality as all other entries in the series. One of the biggest complaints about the book is that the story doesn't move very much. That's mostly true, but the tradeoff is that you get massive amounts of character development. Cersei, in particular, is gone into great detail, and you'll love all of her chapters. George RR Martin has always created complex characters, and A Feast For Crows may be the best example of this yet.<br /><br />I enjoyed it. Maybe it's because I don't have to wait an additional six years to start A Dance With Dragons (which I'll likely begin in a week). Either way, I feel that I'm less biased than your typical Martin hardcore fan. Don't buy into the hate, A Feast For Crows is an excellent read.
B005LAIHYU|3.0|Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter had really, really bad reviews but I still wanted to see it and I am glad I did.  This was not a film that was ever meant to be taken seriously and how could you when Abraham Lincoln and the word 'vampire' appear together in the title?!  Anyway, it turned out to be hugely enjoyable and great fun.  Fast paced, well acted, great action and special effects and with some lovely moments too.  It works especially well because it is played absolutely straight-faced but is obviously tongue in cheek!!  However, it is best viewed in 2D.<br /><br />What makes it even more delicious is that there are now some totally baffled Americans out there who think it really is 'the true story of America's 16th president'!!!<br /><br />I am wheedling to get it as an xmas prezzie!!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|this is a very interesting book, topical subject  some silly humor but that's John<br />Cory. Oh, his is  fictional character.  I read all of DeMille's books  my favorite is still Night Fall.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It was a very quick read. I couldn't put it down...hope the third one is just as good!!!
0156027321|5.0|Piscine Patel had an unusual life growing up in India being a Christian, Hindu, Muslim son of a zookeeper.  When his family decides to emigrate to Canada, they make plans to sell their zoo animals and board a steamer ship along with some of the animals that are being shipped to North American zoos.  The unthinkable happens and the ship sinks leaving only young Pi and some unusual companions to struggle for survival.  This is the story of Pi's ordeal and the lessons we can all learn from it.<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to expect from this novel, the back cover stated that it may make me believe in God even, so I was thinking it had to be something incredibly life changing and profound.  Until about three quarters of the way through, I didn't feel this way at all and was even slightly disappointed in it as it just seemed to be a recanting of a childhood and a survival story....but from that point on the story turned amazing and definitely made you consider storytelling and the nature of faith and believing in something there's no proof of.  I couldn't even go to sleep the night I finished reading it as I couldn't stop thinking about it.  A mind blowing tale!
B007HU7NBK|4.0|Great Honest book about John Taylors life thus far. Genuine, not gossipy accounts.Def felt it was from the heart as he did not trash anyone else or tell any secrets except his own.
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|Very fast!!!  It runs very cool and multitasking is a breeze.  I am very happy I purchased this processor and I got it for a good deal.
0060873175|1.0|If you are a Crichton fan, you may enjoy the first 165 pages. They seem very \\"Crichton\\" except for maybe needing the premise to be a little more fleshed out and the characters a little more developed. However, it seems that there is an extremely obvious switch of authors on page 166. I assume that's where Preston takes over and promptly murders the book. His dialogue is so painful it made my eyes bleed to read it and his sentence structure is not that of a grown-up let alone an experienced author versed in the English language. If you feel the need to satisify your Crichton craving, please save yourself the pain and re-read one of his old books.
B005LAIH2W|1.0|I was not impressed, its long, drawn out and at times can put you to sleep, the effects are amazing and it may just not be a movie for me but I was unimpressed to say the least at this movie
B00280LYIM|5.0|i am just sayin that this book is AWESOME! can't say enough. on my seat every page.you should read the book
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I am not sure what I am trying to do to win, but I don't care.  It's relaxing and fun.
0345803485|5.0|I know that it is not the most well written book and there are some words/phrases that repeat often...but I fell in love with this book instantly.  I do not read erotica/romance novels and finally picked this up last month after a few friends recommended it.  I could not put it down. I recommend that you don't pay attention to the errors or writing issues you may have with it - but focus on the story and see it through to the end of the trilogy.  The story as a whole is great, the second book is better and the 3rd is my least favorite of the 3.  Give it a chance.  I have read the 3 books now 8 times and can't get enough of the story - each time is like the first time reading it.
B007MDB6L0|4.0|Course, school was cancelled due to Hurricane Sandy and they are aware that it is a rental from instant video and will disappear today, but they LOVE it! They are singing along as I write this. The music is great, the pixies are as cute as ever, and the story is original. This is more than worth the purchase! Thinking about buying the DVD they loved it so much.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I've thoroughly enjoyed this music and decided to buy their album.  I was not disappointed.  Excellent and inspiring music.  While I enjoy listening on youtube, it's nice to have their actual album.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|This was a very good and well played movie. Kind of reminded me of a couple others but was very entertaining. I hope to see a sequel as it left you wondering.<br />This is one movie I thought about while watching Prometheus:<br />2001: A Space Odyssey<br />I am well pleased with my purshase of this movie.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|I've had this album on repeat. I bought it after hearing Fitzpleasure. Although that's still my favorite song, the rest of the album is very good. It's atmospheric yet kick*ss, and it almost makes you feel like you're in a movie.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I Loved it just like the first one,great suspense.  I can't wait for the next one so please hurry :)
B009QW6ZT8|5.0|This episode is just perfect as always! I love love love the Walking Dead. Only downside is I didn't like how it didn't show Rick and his gang at all but it was still awesome! This episode really cleared up allot of questions and set the rest of the Season in motion for what is to come!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could not put this book down. It is extremely well written and is so suspenseful that I was very tempted to turn to the end of the book to find the outcome when I was only half way through. This is the kind of book that I feel compelled to discuss with others. Many twists and turns.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Well made....but leave kid's stuff to the kids.  Leave the Snow White story alone.  We feel the story should remain animated.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This was a good book and much better than book 1.  If they left out 1/3 of the sexual parts it would have been two books.  The first book was soooo slow and I was ready to ditch the series but I was glad I read the second and third series books.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|[[ASIN:B008F5YDRI Salmon Fishing in the Yemen]<br /><br />  My wife and I saw this as on one of our Friday night \\"date nights\\" at home.  The plot follows a somewhat predictable path, but the setting, the characterization and the photography put this movie several cuts above the usual romantic comedy.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|If you are a Bruno Mars fan, this is a must. All his well-known songs are here for his fsns.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Great story with a dash of funny and yet some real life circumstances.  This is an especially good movie for folks just beginning retirement to see how strange some things may become even In what seems everyday life.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|A simple and fun game. Reminds me of being at the fair as a kid and playing this game hoping to win all the quarters...that I never won, lol!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|fun app, just wish i had more control over warrior.  I would recommend to someone else.  Im not much on words for any games.
B005I6EVUG|3.0|I returned this case. I loved the design and the four point mounting design for the kindle device. I did not like the pocket for your hand, it stretched out too easily and would have soon become uselss. I also did not like the way the \\"book\\" closed. There was nothing keeping the cover closed, no elastic or magnet. Also, no viewing stand. I knew it had not stand when I purchased it, but if you're looking to use your Kindle for video, the stand is essential.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This was  an adventurous  and exciting book !!!!!!!!!! I loved this book as a teacher , this is a great book for 4th,5th,and 6th graders. Loved it!!!!
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I returned this product for one reason...the stand was terrible. It only offers one position and is not secure. The video shown says you can type on it, but it always fell over on me. I liked the hard casing around the kindle, very secure. I was not a fan of the elastic strap, I prefer a magnetic closure. Other than that poor stand, I would have kept this product.
B008O9V4C2|2.0|I have been a Steely Dan,  Donald Fagan fan ever since day one and I always look forward to anything new by The Dan or Mr. Fagan, but this time, much like he previous release, there's just nothing new here.  It just sounds  like  some low-cal smooth jazz with some uninteresting stories told over the top.  It  has always been my theory that entertainers can only be so good or so creative for so long and it's apparent here that Mr. Fagan is running short on ideas.  Everything is missing on this release, imagery, clever arrangements, and his trademark intellectual/smartass lyrics.  It's an album that I will put in my collection, but never listen to again.  Sorry Don.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My friend has the game on her ipod and its the only thing I want to play or do when she comes over. I am so excited to play it as my own.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I installed the last update and now the app no longer works on my phone.  Please fix or let us know of a way to revert to the previous version.
0393317552|2.0|It is a very well written but still cheap propaganda for a politically correct view of the world. A very complicated and truncated system of lies and deceptions to make non-white races feel good about themselves. To explain away their strikingly minimal contribution to the modern world.<br />Sorry folks, the reason why the Romans (out of dozens of similar Latin tribes) eventually ruled the world has very little to do with geography. It has a lot to do with their moral strength, piousness, courage, patriotism, altruism, curiosity, hard work and genetically determined intelligence and other well known virtues that make a person or a people great.<br />This book is a dangerous lie because instead of helping societies overcome their shortcomings it gives easy excuses for their misery.
0345479092|5.0|This book completely got me as a new mom. It is still how I am able to predict what my son will need. It's a must read.
B005HSL626|5.0|The zen version of this game allows you to veg out and relax while slicing fruit.  It can provide mindless entertainment for those that need to unwind from work.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was amazing! The next best thing to the fifty shades. I cant wait to read the last one!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I love this show! This season duo set is great for starting from the first and catching up on what one has missed.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Absolutely everyone should read this book! I read this book years ago and just decided to read it again.  It helped me learn a lot about myself and was also just a good read in general.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I found the book falling short of what the title would lead you to believe.  I became bored after he  went into the coma and they found out what it was.  After the initial description of 'passing over', the book talks more about what went on around him with his family & friends, what they felt, what they talked about, all of which was told him at his recovery.  At times I felt I was sitting in a college medical class, and times when we were transported back into his past, all after his ordeal was over.  I would not recommend this book unless you are into reincarnation, new age, etc.
0545265355|5.0|I loved the movie so decided I should read the book, now, I am glad I did, read the entire series in two days and kept thinking, WHAT ARE WE DOING TO ONE ANOTHER?<br />This is a brilliant dystopian series, one I would recommend all to read.<br />Go Mockingjay!<br />WaAr
B007KFZ7RE|5.0|If you like the black keys but you wish the new album had more soul...If You like that 60's sound bop band with an electric guitar and some some girls backing up the lead...If you like the New Orleans flow and eb but not to keen on the jazz...or if you like swinging rock-n-roll. This is the album you've been looking for. I shazamed a track off of a commercial (who know what the product was) and liked the whole album. It's good. Buy some music, these guys are hungry.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Couldn't stop reading, had no idea where the story was going.  One of the best books that I have ever read, love to be surprised throughout the book.  Kept me occupied to endure Sandy the hurricane as I was calmly reading this mystery while others were freaking out about the weather.  Just could not leave the story hanging.

B004QX07G4|4.0|\\"Seriously... I'm Kidding\\" was a good, easy read. DeGeneres' writing style is very much like her talk show. I felt like I was reading a manuscript. It was funny but also boring at times due to the rambling. Includes some good \\"life lessons\\" to think about. I might suggest borrowing the book from the library or a friend rather than purchasing it.

B009CVELHG|5.0|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer [MGM}, the premier and most profitable studio of the 1930s and Irving Grant Thalberg {IGT}, the Studio's creative vice president in charge of production and greatest production executive of that {or any other} era with this film showed Hollywood {then and now} how to make an engrossing all star film that remains untarnished by time 80 + years after it's debute as one of filmdom's greatest drama's.<br /><br />IGT was the driving force in pushing the production forward with 5 major stars {most\\"A Class\\" product in 1932 had 2 stars}, fine-tuning the script, casting the picture and working with director Edmund Goulding to create the nuiances / details that create the tension, humor, pathos and drama within the screenplay taking place in a luxury hotel located in Berlin in pre- 1933 Germany before the Nazi storm.<br /><br />The all-star cast includes: Greta Garbo - Gruinskaya, the fading ballerina disillusioned with life, John Barrymore - Baron von Geiger, charming, broke and desperate for money, Joan Crawford - Flaemmchen, the stenographer halfway \\"decent\\", halfway \\"on the make\\" - which of these impluses will prevail? , Wallace Beery - General Director Preysing a hypocritical businessman facing ruin unless he pulls off an impossible business merger and blessed with a \\"roving eye\\", Lionel Barrymore - Otto Kringelein ,a dying little clerk out for one \\"last fling\\" and in support of the stars: veteran characther actors Lewis Stone as the scarred, forlorn Doctor Ottenschlag and Jean Hersholt playing Senf, the Grand Hotel's chief Porter \\"chained to his desk\\" with his pregnant wife expecting a nightmare delivery any second.<br /><br />The Grand Hotel, an art deco marvel courtesy of MGM resident genius art director Cedric Gibbon is the unbilled star of the story where the lives of these very different characthers will inter-twine and some of them will find {and some of them will find and lose} love, death, redemption, wealth, ruin, murder and happiness as their lives and problems criss-cross each other. While every performer gives of their best, two performances in particular stand out - Lionel Barrymore's dying clerk, timid, obseqious with a innate dignity that comes to the hotel to blow his life savings and gets much more than he bargained for and in stark contrast - Wallace Beery's arrogant, gross, ill- mannered boor complete with bristling Prussian haircut and Germanic accent AND YET is somehow still pathetic and vunerable - their performances \\"vis a vie\\" each other and the rest of the cast crackle and sparkle.<br /><br />Amoung the many individual bravura episolds /scenes in the film, three in particular stand out: The introduction of the principle players at the films beginning via closeups of them on the telephone all desperately explaining what the various issues that they needed to resolve and thru quick cuts, editing and cross-cutting of the various conversations it becomes more intense and hightens the tension of the scene AND it sets up the various sub-plots for the entire film. In a humorous aside - Kringlelein gleefully stumbling over, thru and around his hotel room while \\"drunk as a skunk\\" after sampling one to many \\"Louisiada Flips\\" after winning a fortune gambling at the Hotel's American Bar and the classic meeting of Garbo and Barrymore - The Baron skulking, hidden in her room, ready to commit a carefully planned robbery of Gruinskaya's pearls and upon seeing her beauty and desperation reveals himself and without missing a beat - goes from thief to her rescuer, protector and lover. This scene is beautifily played by both stars and it shows a romantic, understated sexual encounter [with the 1932 audience knowing exactly what will subsequently occur off screen} that is quite different from much of the 2012 -2013 U.S.A's TV and Hollywood view of sex and romance AND after Gruinskaya falls under the barons spell she no longer was in the Garbo \\"I vant to be alone\\" mode !!<br /><br />This film is the pre-ultimate example of MGM Studio Product at it's apex - a seamless fusion of star power, glossy production values, sensitive direction, tight editing and a scenario that is compelling and entertaining. At the absolute bottom of the Great Depression in 1932 \\"Grand Hotel\\" was the highest grossing film taking in over 4 million dollars worldwide {when a movie ticket sold from 10 to 35 cents} and winning the Academy Award for best picture.<br /><br />You will not see Irving Thalberg's name on any of the credits for \\"Grand Hotel\\" BUT he was the main force in envisioning, creating and bringing to the screen one of his and MGM's crowning achievements of great product made during MGM's \\"Golden Era\\" of 1930-1940. Doctor Ottenschalg's periodic weary refrain: \\"Grand Hotel, Grand Hotel, people come, people go, nothing ever happens !\\" was definitely shown to be a statement that was \\"just a tad incorrect\\" !!. This is a terrific movie and I give it an enthusiastic 5 Stars  - Highly Recommended.

B004I8WD7S|4.0|This case isn't fancy, but it looks ok, fits perfectly and provides excellent protection. A couple of days after installing it I shut the trunk of my car on my phone. The case shows a small mark, but the phone was completely protected.<br /><br />The headphone jack opening doesn't interfere with any of my various headphones.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product if you simply use your phone, want it protected, and aren't trying to make a fashion statement.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Epic! Totally worth it and excellent in 3D. I was actually surprised by the 3D quality, it was just as good as what I remember in the theater.<br /><br />Definitely worth the money! I must have.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Not my normal kind of read but I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would.  Much of it is almost prescient in a scary way, but I would advise this book to anyone, if you can't find something to take away from it you need a reread of the book, or you were not reading it, just a note I don't give out 5 stars so there you go.  No book should be a one star and you better be amazing for 4, so 5 stars, well that's something.
B007OWRBJK|4.0|As a lifelong fan of not only The Who, but more so Pete Townshend, this is a pretty good book, so far. I am only about 1/3 of the way through it, so far. Pete and his genius (not to mention those beautiful baby-blues) have always mesmerized me, and although I know many of the more popular details, this book offers in-depth insight as to Pete's state of mind and inner thoughts and observations behind much of his artistic development. I am very much looking forward to his experiences which prompted him to write \\"Quadrophenia\\", \\"Psychoderelict\\", \\"White City\\", \\"Empty Glass\\", and \\"Chinese Eyes\\", as these seem to be the more influential albums of my young adult life. Most fans of The Who will recognize the earlier years, when most of the whole band's experiences are remembered, however, it is more for the \\"inner Pete\\" which I was hoping, and I am sure it is soon to be revealed.<br /><br />Thank you, Pete, for sharing.

1616960922|3.0|This was a good book. Not a great book, but a good book.<br /><br />I think I would have ranked this book much more highly had it not been for the first chapter. The writing in that chapter, and ONLY that chapter, was clumsy and awkward, and if I hadn't known Sanderson could do better I might have put it down right there. The writing was cliched and grimly obvious in the way it set up the story. I feel as if Sanderson, trying to cram an entire novel's worth of exposition and world-building into a single chapter, came up with this. It did the rest of the story a disservice.  It felt rushed to press.<br /><br />And it was a disservice, because the rest of the story was great. I was thoroughly engaged in the characters, and finished the book wishing I could spend longer in this world. The magic system was enthralling, and it has so much potential for future stories that I can only cross my fingers and pray that we'll get to revisit it later. Seriously, it's that good. But when I inevitably reread the story, I'll skip that first chapter.<br /><br />Recommendation: For fans of Sanderson's other work, but probably not the best introduction to him or his style.
B007STXHTM|5.0|It came with an assortment of mounts, and it was easy to use for underwater filming.  Over all it is a good product.  Needs addition lighting to be an effective recording tool underwater.
B0090O07S2|5.0|Watching this concert gives you a front row seat to one fantastic concert. The restoration of the original film was beautifully done and the sound was crisp and clear. You really feel like you were put in a time capsule and whooshed back in time to 1968. For any fan of The Doors or someone wanting to learn more about them, this is a must watch. The band looked and sounded great - no fireworks, laser light shows or fog needed here. The Doors talent shines and Jim Morrison is as mesmerizing as ever! The extras on the dvd are stunning tv performances which alone are worth it. I can't wait to see this in the movie theatre - don't miss this one - there will never be anyone like Jim Morrison and in watching this, makes you miss him even more.
B007JF87VS|5.0|Each episode is amazing and I am not a zombie fan. The acting, the suspense. No lines are wasted in each dialogue. It is really a lot of artistry and film making innovation put into this show. I cannot wait each Sunday to watch a new episode. I am completely hipnotized by it. And I am 50 years of age and I do not watch junk Go figure! This show is completely captivating.

159514188X|1.0|I am a high school English teacher.  I did not like that the book made the teachers sound ridiculously clueless. That Mr. Porter did not run after her or do something as a follow-up to their conversation does nothing but make teachers sound like they have no idea what is going on with their students, or that their students may need help. And the teacher who had the students provide topics of discussion seems to be dabbling in counseling realms in which she has no training or background.<br /><br />I also found Hannah unappealing and unbelievable in many ways. She has parents who loved her, but she has NO relationship with them, whatsoever. She had many people in her life who could have loved her if she had let them.  She refused to let them in. She is bright, articulate, and witty; yet she makes this decision to end her life, which does not at all fit her character or her circumstances.<br /><br />I don't believe Hannah wanted help. On the last night of her life, she created her own story.  In fact, she chose what happened throughout the whole book. She had already planned to reveal her last night on the final tape, so being taken advantage of in the hot tub was necessary to her purposes . . . so she sets the stage for it to happen, puts herself right in a hot tub undressed with someone she knows will take advantage of her, allows him to, and then provides the detailed account in the final tape.<br /><br />This is nothing but a highly disturbing revenge story. I see no psychological value in it being devoured by so many of today's young people. If anybody should feel suicidal, it is Clay. He may never be able to have a normal relationship with a female as a result of the tapes, created to \\"get back\\" at all the people in her life who wronged her, even though he was not one of them.<br /><br />I am not sure what this book is seeking to accomplish among young people but I really can't see that it is helpful for someone suicidal to read it.
B0024FADAQ|5.0|I have watched this movie several times now.  It does not get old or tiring.  The plot has an even flow and even though you know the &#34;good guy&#34; wins the battle and the girl, it still is exciting.  I place it on the same scale as &#34;Deep Impact&#34; or &#34;4th of July.&#34;  It is fun, entertaining and exciting.
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|This cd is so beautiful to listen to.  The singing is powerful and rich.  Almost all the lyrics are not in English, which is a slight bummer for me, as I love to sing along.  I am still glad I bought it, and will listen to it over and over.  What an amazing voice!
1451695195|5.0|Having read dozens of books about near-death experiences (NDEs) and other phenomena strongly suggesting the survival of consciousness after death, I didn't read this book in search of \\"proof\\" of \\"heaven.\\"  I had already come to the conclusion that the evidence for survival, if not providing absolute proof, at least meets the \\"beyond a reasonable doubt\\" standard of our legal system.  However, just as the orthodox religious person needs to renew his or her faith by reading his/her \\"good book\\" over and over again and then attending weekly services to hear someone discuss the teachings of the book - discussions probably heard dozens of times before - I find a certain renewal and revitalization in reading newer accounts of NDEs.  Yes, the stories are often similar, as one might expect them to be if they are to be considered evidential, but there is usually enough variety to make the stories interesting, informative, intriguing, and inspirational, what I call the \\"four I's.\\"  This book exceeded my expectations, for each of those four I's.<br /><br />Because Dr. Eben Alexander, the author and experiencer, is a neurosurgeon who was for the most part a materialist with little interest in the subject of NDEs before his own NDE, this story has even more credibility than most, although the pseudoskeptics, in all their wisdom, were attempting to discredit the author as delusional and the victim of wishful thinking even before the book was released.  \\"Like many other scientific skeptics, I refused to even review the data relevant to the questions concerning these phenomena,\\" Alexander tells of his own pre-NDE mindset. \\"I prejudged the data, and those providing it, because my limited perspective failed to provide the foggiest notion of how such things might actually happen.\\"  He now sees such people \\"who know the truth without needing to look at the facts\\" as willfully ignorant.<br /><br />\\"Brilliant, vibrant, ecstatic, stunning,\\" Alexander describes the \\"new world\\" he found himself in after his physical body and brain completely shut down, admitting, as so many others have, that  human language and ideas fail when one attempts to translate celestial visions and experiences into terrestrial imagery and verbiage.  \\"We taint, with out insufficient descriptions, their truly awesome nature,\\" he offers, stressing his belief that what he experienced was \\"more real than the house I sat in, more real than the logs burning in the fireplace.\\"<br /><br />Alexander examines the usual NDE debunking theories, including endogenous glutamate blockade, REM intrusion, \\"DMT dump,\\" the \\"reboot phenomenon,\\" and \\"feigned-death\\" strategies, dismissing them one by one.  Everything he experienced suggested higher, not lower, brain functioning.  \\"The more I read of the `scientific' explanations of what NDEs are, the more I was shocked by their transparent flimsiness,\\" he states, going on to say that after studying the subject matter following his NDE, he began to realize his was \\"a technically near-impeccable near-death experience.\\"<br /><br />In one of the final chapters, Alexander tells of stories he had heard from patients before his experience - stories which he wrote off as fantasy, but which he now saw very possibly real.  He also mentions a very interesting story related to him by one of his colleagues involving \\"terminal lucidity,\\" in which the colleague's dying father, who had been demented, became lucid and in last moments alive.<br /><br />In his 1974 Pulitzer prize-winning book, \\"The Denial of Death,\\" anthropologist Ernest Becker stated that the fear of death haunts the human mind like nothing else. Most people deal with this fear by repressing it - burying it deep in the subconscious and busying themselves with mundane activities. And then, one day, perhaps when it becomes apparent that their days are numbered, those repressed anxieties relating to death begin welling up into the consciousness.  They proceed to live their final years under a dark and increasingly foreboding shadow.  For the most part, the muddled information provided by orthodox religion offers little relief, little comfort.  But books like this one serve to erase that fear and allow the person to embrace death, living his or her final years with a certain optimism.  I am grateful to Dr. Alexander for writing it and intend to buy a few extra copies to give as Christmas presents.reasingly foreboding shadow.

B007ZBWJXI|5.0|asia xxx is there new album celebrating there 30th anniversary. the songs kind of reflect there earlier work. i listened to it the first time and wasn't too sure. after a few times i honestly love it. every track is great. if you go to john wettons web site he reviews the songs and what they are about. i give it 5 stars because the album is really great in my opinion and the band is really tight, at 60 plus years old they still have it.  if your an asia fan i think youl like it, if your not might be a good time to check them out.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I liked this book as much as the first in the series. It definitely has a strong story line, although I don't think it has as many adult/sexual situations. Looking forward to the third!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|As popular as it is, it is not a book for me. The story is too boring. Too much sex out of no where. The whole book is quite repetitive. All in all, I would not recommend it to any of my friends. It was a total waste of my time reading it. If you want to excite your love life, you certainly do not need to do it this way.

0385535147|3.0|I will make this short and very much to the point.  I will leave out a synopsis since you can read that right here on Amazon's page for the book.  So here is my short review.<br /><br />The first 50-100 pages are a great opening.  The character development is lacking, but it really didn't matter to me much.  I rented this for free from the library (that building that has lots of books and movies that one can rent for free), so I didn't invest any money in it.  It was a very entertaining beginning.<br /><br />As the book progresses it takes off on a tangent in the second 100 pages.  It was a little slower through the middle.  However, I was still intrigued by what was going on and yet I was struggling to figure out how this section had anything to do with the first section.  It was harder to get through than the first part, but I had hope that it would tie together in the end.<br /><br />Then came the final 100 pages.  Grisham finally put the first two sections together and in my opinion the payoff was just overall FUN.  I was entertained.  This is a good book to be entertained by.  It is not going to make you think about the meaning of life.  It reads like a movie and wasn't overly long.  I liked how it ended and I really wanted to be where this character ended up!<br /><br />This is not a novel that you want to learn how to write from.  This is NOT anywhere near the novels that \\"A Time To Kill\\", \\"The Firm\\", \\"The Rainmaker\\" and the like were.  This book is, simply put, a work of fun fiction.  Do not expect the best book you have ever read here because you won't get it.  Expect a fun read, and you will get that.  Also, don't spend ANY money on this book.  I highly suggest renting it from the Library or waiting until it is in paperback or on sale for a low price.<br />I hope I have helped!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|First of all, I absolutely love Ken Follet's books.  I found this first novel in his latest trilogy to be the epitome of all that is wonderful about this author.<br />For a book with a very large cast of characters, he really did a fantastic job with developing the plot lines and relationships.  From the major players to the minor ones, each character was fully developed with personalities that truly captivated me.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed the history lesson here, as this is a particular era in which I'm not very knowledgeable.  We all hear so much about WWII, but not much about WWI and the events leading up to that.  I have such a greater understanding of that war, and how it took several nations all thinking they were doing \\"the right thing\\" to ultimately result in terrible tragedies and not-so-terrific triumphs.<br />The scenery was incredibly well detailed, from the harsh landscapes of Siberia to the posh upper class societies of Paris, and well beyond into the Welsh coal mining lands... In classic Follett fashion, I found myself both loving and hating certain characters, often simultaneously.<br /><br />Ultimately, the complexity of this novel is astounding.  Every event I cross-checked was historically accurate, as is usual for Mr. Follett.  It has war, sex, royalty, aristocracy, poverty, discrimination (particularly interesting is the advent of the suffragette movement), and so much more.  I really can't say enough good things about this piece.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|I'm not even a Halo fan but the way they've made the world and characters so developed make it a great sci-fi movie in its own right. For those who are fans - which for my friend is an understatement - there are plenty of nods and references to satisfy them. Master Cheif doesn't even show up till the 4th episode but the world is distinctly Halo.<br /><br />Only the fourth episode has aired so far, but will definately be watching the fifth have preordered the Bluray. Worth it even before the extra content, which hopefully continue to expound on the universe. Might even get me to consider playing the games now.<br /><br />Update: I've seen all the episodes and extra content and yes, it's worth it. For the film makers out there it's interesting and amazing how they put this episodic film together and the detail of how they made it is intriguing. There is also plenty of Halo information for fans, it made me actually want to read up on the lore, which is something I never thought would happen. Overall it is a very well put together video whether you have been a Halo fan forever or are this is your first Halo experience.
B001ECQ75A|4.0|There are some adoption issues in Kung Fu Panda that get more fully addressed in the sequel. In this movie, what we see is that Po is a panda bear. His father is a goose. Po's father points to portraits of various ancestors, and they are all geese. While Po's adoption is not directly addressed, it is hinted at lightheartedly; Po expresses that sometimes he \\"can't believe\\" that he is the son of his father. Mr. Ping hints at telling Po something that Po should have known for a long time, but ultimately shares a secret family recipe rather. In the next movie, Po and Mr. Ping discuss adoption; for now, we're just left with an uncomfortable \\"non-dealing\\" with the issue.<br /><br />The villain of the movie also was adopted, at least to some extent: Tai Lung was found and raised by Shifu. Although adoption is not mentioned by name, Shifu took Tai Lung in, and raised him like a son. Shifu believed that Tai Lung would be appointed Dragon Warrior, but Shifu's master Oogway saw darkness in Tai Lung (we're never told the reasons). Tai Lung became bitter, turned on Shifu, and was imprisoned. He returns to his former home for revenge.<br /><br />A main thrust of the movie seems to be Po's identity development. He doesn't like who he is. He wants to be someone else. Some of his questions are probably rooted in his adoption. In this movie, the question: \\"Can I be someone else?\\" is answered with \\"Who you are is fine.\\"  In the next movie, [[ASIN:B006JPML7K Kung Fu Panda 2]], the question is \\"who am I, really?\\"
B0078X2LKY|5.0|Loved this book as a child and now my son loves it.  I used to laugh once I discovered who the scary monster is at the end of the book!
B001HN6918|5.0|Adoption issues were touched on in the first Kung Fu Panda movie -- Po (the Panda) notices that all of his ancestors are geese, and he and his father, Mr. Ping, almost talk about it. In this movie, they do talk. Mr. Ping shares his experience of the day he met Po. As the story progresses, Po learns more about his history, and finally has to answer a question posed by another character: \\"Who are you?\\" Po ends up being able to synthesize his identity as a panda and as the son of Mr. Ping. This is a fun movie, and could be helpful for adoptive families trying to help their children be comfortable with \\"multiple-source\\" identities.

B0076DCT2G|4.0|add a few wisecracks, some stock cliches about patriotism and the threats from unseen minority enemies, pretty women and interchangeable govt bureaucrats and you too could write a Demille thriller--or could you?  About 65% of the panther is exposition.  This could be one of the best and most readable accounts of the history of Yemen, its geopolitics and our attempt at surgical warfare to balance conflicting interests throughout the mideast outside of a scholarly analysis in a pedantic journal.  The last 25% of the book is pure DeMille and the action is thrilling and complex.  This time technological warfare with drones and missels thwarts kate and john and creates an irony of modernism against a landscape of primitivism  Demille is a master at synthesizing information collected by others--there's no evidence he even visited yemen and he is generous and forthright about his sources.  Although the first 65% of the book is so flat and the characters rendered with so little definition I wasn't sure who was who and there are a lot of dangling unresolved plot lines like Cory's intrigue with the Panther's American past and his family, the young american Matt (turns out is a real friend of DeMille's son).  Nevertheless, it makes for involving and informative reading and a new respect for DeMille's subtle mastery and ability to transcend the requirements of the genre.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much as I'm something of an Anglophile and the village of Pagford sounds like somewhere I'd like to visit.  It's one of those idyllic British villages.....or at least that's what it seems.  The death of a local councilor leads to revelation of the worst characteristics in the most unlikely people.  Racism, prejudice, addiction, greed, child abuse, marital infidelity, snobbery and dishonesty abound -- all beautifully revealed by J. K. Rowling's prose.  It's a keeper!!

This ebook was also cheaper than a used book from other text book reselling websites. After ordering, I was reading in 5 minutes!! Highly recommended!!
B007QPFGJW|3.0|This is a long and very slow reading book.  As someone else pointed out, there are to many characters to keep track of.  For Harry Hole fans, it is still a must read.
B0068LYEHA|2.0|I only read it halfway and then just couldn't go on anymore, it was like sitting next to someone that just keeps on talking nonsense to fill up the hours going by, when all you want is for them to keep quiet. Yes funny in parts, but really just not enough when you all you want to do is crawl under a blanket and relax with a good book at the end of a busy day.

B002WJI65S|5.0|Best thing I ever did for my current apartment was hang this guy from a kitchen cabinet. Every time I or my roommate walks through the kitchen, we go, \\"oh!... goomba...\\" Sometimes my girlfriend grabs him and marches him towards me, making grumbling noises, until I bop him on the head with a laptop. Goombas are made to be squashed.

B008Y1YFNU|5.0|I really like this album.  It's a little different than past albums but still plenty of good songs.  I would recommend this album to any P Roach fans out there.
B000002J03|5.0|Sure, Led Zeppelin might have rushed to record it during the downtime of their first stateside tours, but \\"II\\" is still a positively masterful album. Hugely influential, too -- it would go on to inspire trillions of bands, and thousands of just plain imitators/copycats. And sure, the template for several of these songs might be bluesy rock and roll; but overall, \\"II\\" packs a very heavy, straightforwardly driving, and viscerally-satisfying sonic force. This is mostly thanks to the fact that Jimmy Page comes up with some of the absolute finest, biggest, and most infectious riffs of his recording career all throughout these nine songs. And, as cuts like \\"The Lemon Song\\" prove, he is no stranger to wailing guitar solos, too.<br /><br />\\"Whole Lotta Love\\" is an instant and immediately recognizable classic opener. The song is blues-rock at its core (heck, it even features a Theremin!); but it does feature heavy, metallic musicianship -- Page pounds out a wealth of simple yet very inventive, galloping (and always really loud) riffs. \\"What Is And What Should Never Be\\" is another very bluesy number, and it is not as heavy as its predecessor; and, in fact, is curiously quiet and ambient (at least in part). \\"The Lemon Song\\" returns the album back to its heavy roots, though, with brutal riffs and propulsive, muscular bass lines. (And the above-mentioned solo section, too.) \\"Thank You\\" anchors pretty, feather-lite acoustic flourishes with ominous bass lines, and tops it all off with Robert Plant's trademark wail. \\"Heartbreaker\\" is another undisputed classic, a heavy, big riff rocker with a solid, grumbling bass bottom, and another excellent, epic guitar solo section. And dig the song's great chorus, too -- it is one that you cannot get out of your head even if you wanted to! \\"Living Loving Maid (She's Just A Woman)\\" features similarly guitar-driven rhythms in the verses that flow into another killer, and instinctively memorable chorus.  \\"Ramble On,\\" again sees the band exploring experimental, progressive territory, with jazzy, jangly acoustic guitars and nicely melodic bass work. The set-closing \\"Bring It On Home\\" opens with a wailing, Jethro Tull-esque bluegrass-y sounding harmonica; but the guitars slam their way onto the scene around a minute and forty-five seconds in, thus transforming the song into another big riff-driven hard rocker.<br /><br />However, it is \\"Moby Dick\\" that takes the indisputable cake for being the album's epic standout. Almost deserving of a whole new review all by itself, \\"Moby Dick\\" begins on a heavy note, with hard-rocking, even mildly doomy, downtuned guitars driving the intro. A shredding solo crops up, too -- but it is all just a lead-in to one of the best drum solos of all time. Indeed, percussionist John Bonham sure shows off his impressive dexterity, here, by creating a fantastic, nearly three-minute long solo that is at times jazzy-sounding and at other times thundering. But this drum solo is always terrifically deft, bouncy, rollicking, insanely memorable, and historically epic.<br /><br />1971's \\"IV\\" is still the crown jewel in Led Zeppelin's discography, but in no way should that take anything away from this album. \\"II\\" is one of the most influential and quintessential heavy metal recordings of all-time. And no music collection should be without it.experimental, progressive territory, with jazzy, jangly acoustic guitars and nicely melodic bass work.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|Loved, loved this book!  I'm not usually into the fantasy genre, but after having seen the first season of Game of Thrones on TV, I decided to give the books a try.  So happy I did!  I'm already into book 4 and can't put it away.

B007THA4FI|2.0|My 85 year-old mother read this book; I have yet to read it.  Mom did not enjoy it.  The only \\"likeable\\" character was the one who died in the beginning of the book.  Mom also told me that while in the \\"Harry Potter\\" series the details that made Harry's world come alive simply made this book boring.
B0058S0OMS|3.0|This is a review of the non-Shout Factory version. I bought it because it was cheap and Halloween 2 is not worth the 20 or 30 bucks for the Shout version.<br /><br />So I watched the original Halloween blu-ray that Starz or Anchor Bay put out several years ago, followed by this. The Anchor Bay blu-ray is fantastic for picture quality. It was like watching Halloween for the first time. Very impressed.<br /><br />Then I followed it with this.......and was very disappointed. The picture quality sucks, to say the least. Very grainy, especially in some darker scenes. I know that some grain is supposed to be there but this had grain throughout the whole movie. It is just a poor quality transfer.<br /><br />To watch it on it's own, I probably would not think so poorly of this blu-ray, but watching it after the stunning picture quality of Halloween, it was very disappointing. It is still a better picture than the DVD would be, but I expect more from a Blu-ray.<br /><br />You get what you pay for, I guess..........

Once you figure out how this App operates, it is fun to play around with, however, I have not found a practical purpose for it. I removed it from my device to give room for something more usable.

I'd give it a 4.5 if I could, just because the story could have used a bit more development, but sometimes you just want to see someone kick the crap out of people right?! right.
B004IDYK0G|5.0|Awesome album. I could listen to the whole album over and over!!! The vocals are fantastic and the lyrics are great! I am huge fan!!!
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|First off, allow me to state that I AM a Brooklyn born & bred individual, so for me personally this movie hits home perhaps a little harder than anyone that most likely doesn't even have a clue on what time zone The Big Apple is located in, so please allow me some leeway and an understandable outlook on my review; Thanks.<br />This is a story about a boys love for his father, (portrayed by Tom Hanks), who died in the World Trade Center on 9/11. Being that they both were more like best friends then father & son, the youngster felt as if he wasn't there to help his dad on that fatal day thus throwing him into a deep depression and an obsession on completing a task which he believed was going to be put into play by his dad. Although most of you will find this child to be an annoyance, I personally believe he should have won an Oscar for his portrayal, being it was the first movie which he performed in. Sandra Bullock played the boys Mom and I will say to \\"just have the tissues at hand\\". I do believe that the title wasn't very popular for a movie that I will obviously endorse for you to see. My thanks to you for your time, hope this outlook helps you, hopefully you'll find it pleasurable too...
B0049VZ222|5.0|This is a very talented cast and storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat!  We have not stopped watching trying to catch up to the new episodes!
1936891026|5.0|Whatever you do, don't read this book unless you're serious about getting down to the work that calls you. You might want to paint a picture, write a novel, start a business or whatever. But if you read THE ART OF WAR and don't get going on your life's work, a metaphorical Steven Pressfield will perch on your shoulder and whisper in your ear, reminding you that its time to get on with your dream. And he won't go away.<br /><br />Pressfield attacks all of the forms that Resistance (the enemy of creativity) can take. If you procrastinate or self-medicate or lose the day to personal soap opera, or engage in constant healing, waiting for the perfect time to launch your project Pressfield argues that Resistance is winning your soul. Same thing with self-doubt, mindless fear and clever rationalization. They are all Resistance.<br /><br />But if are serious about your work, THE WAR OF ART is an invaluable ally. Pressfield not only inspires the reader to dream and work but explains the change in mindset that is necessary to do the creative endeavors that call us. With Pressfeild's guidance, I was able to complete the writing of a book I had started and all but abandoned. But thanks to his insights and encouragement HOOP CRAZY: COLLEGE BASKETBALL IN THE 1950S is now a reality.. I would highly recommend THE WAR OF ART to anyone who longs to make a change and get down to the work that their higher selves calls them to begin.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|Great movie, had many of the stuff I loved in the first one! I have watched it a few times and it does not get old.
B00914JWSW|4.0|A collection that has quite a few gems and with a singer like Barbra, that means another classic recording. The gems include: Being Good, Didn't We, I Think It's Going to Rain Today...and more. As I write this I realize every track is fantastic! All the songs are gems.
B00846TTDG|3.0|Don't see this movie for the acting, because it is horrible. The action scenes and tactics were great. This is a must see for any veteran. A good time with this one.
B009AMAM9S|2.0|This is a very long film made up of a bunch of short stories that are mostly disconnected from each other. As I have not read the book, I can't say if the failure was in the original material or capturing the original material on film. But for me, the stories told in the film don't connect with each other enough to really tell an overall story. The story also lacks any sort of payoff in the end.<br /><br />The one thing I can think of to compare it to is D. W. Griffith's \\"intolerance\\" from 1916. There are some vague similiarities in structure and intent.<br /><br />The film also has a basic conflict in directorial styles built into it. Tom Tykwer handled the complicated human stories within the film while the Wachowskis were called in for the Japanese homage swipes. The Wachowskis populate the film with all their now familiar cliche material. I guess it speaks to the visual and philosophical strength of \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" that the Wachowskis continue to do so very well mining it for material.<br /><br />The music (not the \\"cloud atlas\\" itself) in the film was good (sometimes great). Some of the philosphical lines in the film worked, others didn't. The success of the big lines often depended on how well the story elements supported them. Often those story elements didn't support them enough. Too often the story is caught up in big ideas and loses touch with the meaning of small human interconnections. Too often the film falls back on simple matters of freedom versus totaltarism or slavery of one sort or another where there are always easy answers and a clear moral path.<br /><br />For a film about big ideas, the ending was very shallow indeed. Walking away from the consequences of your actions is an often popular choice, but not a philosophically brave choice.
B009AJDDQU|2.0|A very long movie for the story. Very predictable and you can see other parts of sci-fi movies in this one. The ending was a let down. How the hell do you get and alien from the combo in the end, beats me.
B005LAIISU|3.0|Saw this movie in an all digital theatre in 3D and still thought it was just okay.  When are they going to make a movie with Scrat as the main character.  I feel like they tried very hard to usurp him into the screen time much more, however I think the magic is gone from the herd of various animals sticking together.  The only character which doesnt currently drive me nuts to hear their voice is John Leguiziamo.  The pirates were fresh, but really they need to go back to square one on this idea
B008JH5CVS|2.0|The same story told over and over again. The acting was bad and you know what is going to be next. This is a pass, wait till it comes out on tv.
B00337KMAA|4.0|Nice break from the cookie cutter garbage being spat out monthly by Hollywood.  Unique film with an interesting narrative and character developement.  Very humorous sections in the film especially during downsizing events.  Definitely worth a good watch.
B009QW7HMC|5.0|This keeps you on the edge of your seat. I love the way they tell the sorry. One of the best on TV.
B001PR0YGC|5.0|Definitely loved this movie.  Matt Damon is so smooth, witty, believable, and just downright entertaining.  Once you realize what is going on in the storyline you can't do much but laugh the rest of the movie.  The fact that this is based on a true story makes it that much more of a movie.
B000SSDQYG|5.0|Always one of my favorite album; a pleasure to play it on vinyl!<br />I got it fast and in great condition, thank you!
B001UV4XUQ|3.0|I heard all the fuss about this movie when it was in theatres.  Not much of a love story if you ask me.  The actors are adorable and just watching them is fun by itself, but this movie is not what everyone claims it to be.  Its not The Notebook, and there is just too much angst, confusion, and separation for this movie to be considered a love story.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Its fun....not your normal Bejeweled. Lots of different games with in. Its a good challenge with multiple goals to achieve.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|it is a funny book for boys and girls but i can not belive that there are more diary of the wimpy kid books when i first read it made me laugh but after a while i read it  agein and i was boring
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I was very disappointed with the story. It had very slow portions in it.  She has definitely written better, more exciting novels.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Frankly, after reading it, it shocked me why is a Best Seller. The story is not new. It's basically an adaptation of other romantic novels, just with different scenerio. I tried to give it a chance but at the end, it didn't make want to read more. It's so out of reality. It's kind of a bizarre fairy tale that definitively, doesn't happen. She is a good writer, though, because you can read it pretty easily but that's quite it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Good game, keeps me occupied when i have down time.  Easy to use and no errors.  thumbs up.  i approve

1423389409|5.0|This review is about the Audiobook version. I have listened to several epic fantasy series on audiobook, and I must say the KingKiller Chronicles audiobook versions are one of the best, if not best fantasy series audiobooks out there.<br /><br />Obviously, the audiobook reader is what makes or breaks the audiobook, and sadly i have listened to some readers that destroy the book entirely. Nick Podehl, the reader for the KingKiller Chronicles, is absolutely amazing, perhaps even better than the readers for The Wheel of Time series (whom I enjoy).<br /><br />Here is a quick list of what makes Nick Podehl an excellent story teller.<br /><br />1. Podehl has a great variety of voices for the various characters, many of which are quite diverse. His voices are consistent for each character and for how each character ought to sound in terms of nationalities, accents, age, gender, etc. The voices also fit in easily with my imagination; they did not clash and make me think \\"that is not how that character ought to sound\\". If there is an old wise mystical man, I have ideas and bias about how he should sound (Gandalf, Dumbledore, Zedd from the sword of truth series, etc.), and if he does not sound the way I imagine then it is noticed.<br /><br />His many voices add a new depth to the overall story, for not only do you get to experience the wonderful world that Rothfuss has created, but you also get to hear how voices change throughout this world, through Podehl's own imagination and talent. In fact, several times I knew what nationality a character was through the voice of the reader (although it was likely mentioned earlier in the book).<br /><br />2. None of Podehl's voices are annoying. Annoying voices are the most devastating flaw an audiobook reader can have. Not only do annoying voices make the book less enjoyable, but you are constantly thinking of how much you dislike the voice, instead of listening to the story. All of Podehl's voices are easy on the ear and enjoyable. Even characters with accents because of their nationality are easy to understand, and never did I have to re-listen to a section because I did not understand what was said.<br /><br />3. Podehl is a competent, intelligent reader. He knows his stuff, and he knows the story very well, down to its bones. His tones of voice are spot on, letting you hear the words the way they are meant to be said. He knows the context of each word and all the complexities of each words meaning. He knows the characters and how they ought to act. This adds even more depth to the story, giving you insights into the characters emotions and meanings behind each word that you might miss by simply reading them. At no point did I think \\"that is definitely not how the sentence is meant to be read.\\"<br /><br />4. Along with competence, Podehl's pronunciation of unfamiliar words and names gave me no issues. Although I have read the book in paperback format, I did not actually look up words and check his pronunciations against my own imagined pronunciations of the word. Still, I found no problems with them. (In comparison, I have listened to a book with two readers, where they pronounced a name quite different from each other. It took me a long time to even realize they were talking about the same character!).<br /><br />5. Finally, Podehl's voice fits Kvothe perfectly. I can't remember if it took me some getting used to, but the voice is exactly how I imagine Kvothe should sound. It is a very enjoyable voice, easy to listen to and understand, and I cannot imagine it sounding any other way.<br /><br />If you enjoy fantasy, and like to listen to audiobooks, the KingKiller Chronicles would be my number one recommendation. Not only is Nick Podehl fantastic, but the KingKiller Chronicles is one of my favorite fantasy series out there, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys delving into fantastical worlds with secrets and mysteries, love and loss, fairytales and legends, and characters whoyou can come to know and love.<br /><br />Yes, some people have issues with the books, but I enjoyed them without end. Above all else, I read fantasy for enjoyment, and as long as you go into it looking for adventure and wonder, you cannot possibly dislike these books. Perhaps the author gets side tracked along the way, but that is likely because he was so intensely into the story himself that it never even crossed his mind. Without a doubt, 5 star.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This is a fun and addicting game.  Once you start it's hard to put down. However it has convenient breaks between the various screens and levels that provide good stopping points. I would give it 5 stars if the help section was a little more detailed about what items have what powers and how best to use them. All in all it is a  worthwhile game to have.
B00846TTDG|5.0|This is an excellent movie.  It shows the character of men that go past living in fear, though it is there, and fight for the freedoms that most of us take for granted.  It showed the sacrifices that some families make as their loved one fights in a place where they may never come home from, but have the strength and integrity that goes beyond worldly thinking.  I highly recommend this movie.  Would love to see our youth be raised with this level of honor.  They are our there, but not many.  They are the few.  The proud.  They are The Men Of Valor.

B0098VYCCE|4.0|This film was wonderful. Everyone in my family enjoyed this film. Kristen Stewart and Charlize Theron were fabulous and the supporting cast were terrific also. The film contained alot of action scenes and great dialogue. The cinemetography was beautiful. It had some violence but not nearly as bad as most movies today. I recommend this movie.
B000NY12LO|5.0|Amazingly raw, emotional story. Could not put it down. Heart wrenching and engaging. The intertwining of youth in love, high school tragedy and a parent's concern and love of their child.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|I was listening to this book and could barely stand it. I quit listening when he discovers the three religions and gets scolded for it. It might be more apparent to me because I was listening to the book, but there are more lists than I have ever encountered in a book before. It is completely unnecessary and mind numbing. Yes, I get it! There are animals at the zoo! there is no need to list them every time you stroll by!<br />  I also thought the author was trying too hard. There is a lot of over description that leaves nothing to the imagination. It is like we are being locked in this book instead of taking the trip willingly in own own domain. He is obviously a very opinionated person as evidenced in his long defenses of zoos and the three religions he adopts.<br />I will not be finishing it.
B0091QS88K|3.0|My niece really likes this game. The graphics and interaction level are great. But there is not alot of cooking options in the free version. Cute game, will entertain for a while...
B008FPOIT6|3.0|I was really excited to read this book after seeing its reviews. However, I found this book to be boring and not very well written. I would suggest it for younger children (10-14yo), not experienced readers.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|The title says it all. It is Bejeweled themed after Atlantis. Colorful, challenging at times. Good to kill some time.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Just finished reading this series this morning. I read all the time and my favourite genre is dystopian science fiction - this is by far the best book(s) I have read in years. The writing is excellent, the characters so well developed and I was genuinely surprised several times throughout (which rarely happens to me anymore). I simply could not stop reading!<br /><br />I read at the end of book 5 that Hugh Howey reads his reviews so I wanted to write my very first review to let him know how much I genuinely enjoyed this series. He is now one of my top 5 fave authors and I will be recommending these book to all my friends. I also hope to have an opportunity to read more in the future - what's going on in Silo 17??!! :)

Of course, their institutional account has some relevance, but there are some explanations that have to do with historical chance that affect outcomes, all else being equal. This is not a satisfying treatment, as one can find institutional issues and geographic/environmental and chance issues that affect the fate of almost any country. In other words the explanation for failure are not simple and not predictable, and thus one should be able to consider a multiplicity of explanations. As a result, their theory is not subject to verification, since there are so many chance issues that completely alter the outcome.
B007PP2J9I|5.0|Mark Russinovich does it again...only better. I loved the first novel, Zero Day. This sequel brings all the elements that made the first novel great only with a little more polish (I mean that as a good thing). Mark does a great job balancing the technical aspects with the human drama that keeps you turning the pages. What's really interesting is reading about all the different ways systems can be exploited. Curious to see if the next novel focuses on social engineering attacks or if there are more tricks in Russinovich's bag of technical tricks. Great book/series and can't wait for more titles.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|It had a so so start...but got better and ended up not wanting to put it down! Read it if you dare!
B0073XV2W2|5.0|Ever since discovering Daemon, Daniel Suarez has become my favorite techno-thriller author. Kill Decision is a fantastic story that perfectly blends techno-terror (is that even a real word/phrase?) and action. While Daemon/Freedom were a bit more cerebral, this story leans more on action. Drones were scary enough before reading this book but after this you'll never look at them the same way again.
0307887960|5.0|This diet really works. I have lost ten pounds in such a short time. I will stick with this diet.
B000000OE7|5.0|I came to Queen in MY early 60s, yet I find this final celebration of the vocal magic of Freddie Mercury to be a true crown for the fourteen previous albums. The warmth and poetry are very touching, even before experiencing the twenty-three minute final track, clearly emanating from another dimension.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very Addictive. Cool Graphics. Great for the Kindle Fire!!! I play it at least 2 or 3 times a day.@
B004LZF2LW|5.0|This is by far one of the handiest apps I have and I use it all the time. Attractive, simple to use, reliable and accurate. I travel a lot across timezones and I teach online courses to national and international students. Thanks to this app I have never missed a flight or a course. Definitely worth the money.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|'A Discovery of Witches' is a very fun novel! Although I will agree with several reviews here that the author spends way too much time on mundane details (toast, eggs, and scalding tea... Black trousers or leggings, a sweater or pullover, misbehaved hair) and some details are somewhat odd (true love in 3 weeks?), it's still a good read. It goes very quickly. As a college student, it's nice to turn my brain off every now and then from dense school readings and turn to something like this! The characters and story are fun... It's an elevated version of 'Twilight,' for sure. I love all of the historical details and the scholarly context, I think that's what makes the book for me. Enjoy!! :)
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I wish the next book was out already !!! so I know what happens !! It makes me wish I could find someone like mr.crossfire for myself
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I had been wanting the product for a long time and was surprised to pick it up so reasonably priced!  I am very happy with it and it got here so timely.  fantastic deal.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel and want to read the third one. I can not wait and start to read
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Highly recommend this movie, excellent action, excellent cast, Have purchsed the whole series leading up to the Avengers. Great collection in our library
B008XG1X18|5.0|love pinterest. I have made a lot of dinners from the recipes on here and my family has loved them.also made a few tailgate party recipes and everyone ate it all up.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|Perfect summertime mindless adventure movie. Some of the humor is subtle, but overall the predictability was fun. Some of the acting was a little over the top, but I expect that from Marvel Comics.
B007454AVE|5.0|This was purchased to add to his Cars duplos.  The duplo race day was purchased for Christmas,he really likes building<br />duplos.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|I felt that Ridley Scott should have kept up with the no names to start theory.  Charlize was not a good choice, she felt flat and like a writter that has a stash novel hidden, publishes it just to get by.  Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender were the scene makers, but David the robot, took me back to Nash in the first Alien movie, what a great tie in, still; I felt cuts were intense and took from the movie, I would have sat for another hour, would you?  \\"Should have left them in!\\" Good movie, Noomi was no Helen Ripley, but she held it together for Ridley Scott, too bad...like I said, good movie buy it for the collect.
B00979CS50|5.0|I could swear when I was listening to this album I was listening to a Neil Young album from the 70's.  That's the sound and spirit they have created here.  Excellent songs, production, and guitar work!  Every song is a winner!  I long for music like this and hearing a great new release like this almost restores my faith in rock and roll!  I use to say Neil Young's problem is he just makes too many new CDs.  He puts out something new almost every year.  But maybe that turned out to be a good thing?  Practice makes perfect!  Because he sure nailed this album.  In my opinion this is the best Neil Young CD in more than 20 years! After the 1992 comeback Harvest Moon which was the quieter mellower acoustic sound he nailed again (from the early 70's), now he's nailed his electric style (from the late 70's). Great treat from Neil Young and Crazy Horse, be sure to pick up this one!
B008PWUYVA|4.0|I was mainly interested in this jacket because I wanted one which I could use to make my Kindle freestanding on any surface (especially airplane trays).  My Kindle Fire fit perfectly inside the window opening, which is held by one velcro strip in the middle of the inside binding. The cover folded over just fine to make a stand and on the bottom of other cover there is a long strip made of tiny little bumps which apparently will grip the surface so the case & Kindle stays upright in landscape mode.  I tried it on different table surfaces and it worked.<br /><br />The cover exterior is not as pretty as the other case I bought, nor does it have a slat for a hand grip, but overall it does work much better as a stand.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|awesome movie! great for all ages! I would recommend this movie to everyone! It was definately worth it and amazon was so easy to use!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I am hoping this cable will be much better than the original and hopefully they have learned their lesson. The cable that came with my Kindle literally fell apart after about a year...made very cheaply ... the outer coating just peeled off the wire wrap. I am hoping this new one will hold together.
B000002NFM|5.0|This album pretty much helped redefine REAL techno.  I first heard Breathe when it hit the local rock station and LOVED IT!!!  Then I heard Smack My B**** Up when I borrowed it from a friend and I told him I had to make a copy of it.  I could not stop listening to it for the longest time.  Anyone who loves rock and/or techno will absolutely love this album!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this great game will give u hours of fun and most of the games are really easy. the graphics are good as well
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool are a band that you can't help but fall in love with their melodic and dark approach to heavy rock.  Maynard is a vocal GOD!!!  I wish they would make more music, but hey, They left on the best note any legendary band could leave on.  Tool is a band that all of their albums are required in your collection!!!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|The Heist, on the whole, showcases some of Macklemore's best work: the lyrics are heartfelt and stirring, his cadence is awesome, and the tunes each individually tell a story that paints a picture you'll find it hard to look away from. Backed by Ryan Lewis's innovative and pleasant sound, this album is worth every penny. The deluxe edition has, I believe, 6 or 7 more songs than the other title, and is only 4 bucks more: way worth it, too, especially since Starting Over and My Oh My are included in the extra tracks.
B008DVJO8C|5.0|I'm not sure how any metal or rock fan can't like this.  This is a beautiful album, vocally and melodically.  Their song \\"Beautiful Tragedy\\" from a few albums ago turned me off to them, but then I actually listened this album and just wow, this album is a HUGE improvement.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I'd say this game is entertaining. I don't know if I would pay but I am enjoying playing so if you like these kind of games get it! And have fun
B0041B785Y|5.0|I figured I'd give this one a try and see what they sound like now.  I also recently learned they use a custom 8 string guitar; it is obvious that they have one.  \\"The Hurt That Finds you First\\" is an extremely brutal and fast track that sucker punches the hell out of you.  The only issue I have with that song is it ends slowly and drags out.  This album is definitely the heaviest they have done and is outstandingly awesome!!!
B00957T6X6|5.0|I loved all of them, went into a world of fantasy!!<br />I just can't wait for the last one. I thought it was<br />coming out on the 30/11/2012. Where is it?
B008O69SZ0|5.0|As I die-hard Ian fan, I pre-ordered this CD. Ian has so many styles, you're never sure what you might get, but they're always great.  This one rocks. I had the good fortune to go and see the great man in Chicago for 2 nights at the City Winery, where he performed several songs from this CD. The title song is a rocking semi-protest/parody that out-dylans Dylan. The first track, \\"Comfortable\\" is a hard-driving tune that will play in your head for days after, and make you smile every time it does.  If you like Ian, or any great classic rock, this album is for you!
B009LE7AU4|5.0|John Taylor is down to Earth, warm, and a great story teller. Easy to relate to and a great listen!
B000PMLFRA|1.0|This has all George Lucas' idiotic edits.  Disney, please please give us the real originals now that Lucas is out.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|As usual, Ms. Cornwell's writing was exceptional and well-researched.  However, the theme of \\"everyone is out to get Scarpetti\\" is wearing thin.  I would like more action, and less looking into Scarpetti's inner world.  I would rate this book 3 1/2 stars.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Used this app to check my wifi connection in my room from my kindle, realized my iphone has the weakest signal out of all my electronics. Trying to change my channels but cant find my router information
1451695195|1.0|I saw the author interviewed on TV and was impressed by his credentials.  I have never believed in this type of thing; near death experiences, ghosts, astrology, ESP.  At least, not since the third trade.  Here was a man, an obviously accomplished physician, a neurologist, no less, who was claiming to have had a near-death experience during which he visited what appeared to be heaven.  I bought the kindle version and began to read.<br /><br />I found that he and I had a few things in common, at least peripherally.  He was raised in Winston Salem; I was born there.  His dad worked at Bowman Gray; my dad did his residency at Bowman Gray, I was born at the Baptist Hospital,  and my sister is a Wake Forest graduate.  He attended Duke Medical School; so did my dad.  These things were not important in establishing whether or not the author was sincere, but they naturally made me feel a slight kinship with him; i was ready to open my mind and give him the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />I read with interest about his disease, his coma, and the \\"after death\\" experience he had in an idyllic heaven, guided by a beautiful spirit who, he later found, was his long deceased sister, a person whom he had never met.<br /><br />It was interesting and while i read, i kept reminding myself; \\"This guy is a neurologist who was an associate professor at Harvard!  He had astronaut training and graduated from Duke Med School!  He wears bow ties, just like I do!  Could this be true?  Is there really an afterlife?  This book could change my entire worldview!\\"<br /><br />Then, I hit chapter 16.<br /><br />\\"16.  The Well<br /><br />Holley first met our friend sylvia in the 1980's, when both were teaching at the Ravenscroft School in Raleigh, N.C.  while there, Holley was also a close friend of Susan Reintjes.  Susan is an intuitive...\\"<br /><br />SCREEEEEEEECH!!<br /><br />A what?  What's an \\"intuitive\\"?<br /><br />And \\"Ravenscroft\\"?  I'm sure this is the name of an actual school, but the name, Ravenscroft, reminded me a little of something from Harry Potter.<br /><br />\\"...She was also a channel and had written a book called 'Third Eye Open', which Holley was a big fan of.\\"<br /><br />What's a \\"channel\\"?  Am I supposed to know what a channel is?  \\"Third Eye Open\\"; what?  Sounds obscene.<br /><br />\\"One of the spiritual healing activities Susan regularly performed involved helping coma patients to heal by contacting them psychically.\\"<br /><br />I stopped reading.  I don't know what happened after chapter 16.  Maybe he went to an astrologer to have his horoscope cast.<br /><br />The inclusion of \\"channel\\" and \\"intuitive\\" was bad enough.  But it was done so casually; as if the author took for granted that any normal person would know what these things were and would, of course, accept them as legitimate.  It reminded me of a TV commercial for a set of Time Life books years ago in which was stated, \\"Well, everybody's a little psychic.\\"  After seeing this commercial i wrote Time Life an indignant letter and have never since bought a Time Life book.<br /><br />I'm sure the author is a nice person.  And well-educated.  But chapter sixteen made me question his scientific objectivity, neurologist or not.  I neither know nor care what a \\"channel\\" is.  I don't believe that Susan contacted coma patients \\"psychically\\".<br /><br />Here's a tip; if you're trying to convince a sceptic that something magic happened, don't compound your problems by introducing more magic into the narrative.  Dupe them a step at a time.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|Who doesn't love free apps for their kindle?  And TripAdivor is my 'bible' to all things travel, I use it to see photos of hotels, read users comments (which we all like to do, no?) Great tool.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Takes longer than other site to come up....often says can't find secure connection while other sites have no problem. Too many ads for products I might like that I have no interest in.
1594744475|4.0|It was great as far as giving me cute ideas for ways to arrange foods, and even a few recipes.  I don't know how much my boyfriend would like getting a bunch of cute animals in his lunch, but I definitely think it is a great book for people with children.  I wish it had the nutrition content of the recipes though.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|The first two of this trilogy were a tad boring and it got to the point that the sex part became such a non-issue that I couldn't click my page turner on my Kindle fast enuff.<br />The third book had me wanting to skip to the end which I am glad I didn't because it ended so weakly that I exclaimed out loud, \\"Are you kidding me?\\"<br />Good for the author to make so much money off of this...and now a movie?<br />Perfect in the day of reality everthing so that quality is hidden under the pet rock.
0753539470|5.0|Positive book to read.  Good information and interesting ideas. Enjoyed reading the book and seeing the information on a localPBs station.
B009ESIGHI|5.0|This is my favorite telling of the \\"A Christmas carol\\" and suggest anyone and everyone should see it at least once. As the other reviewer at this time points out a song is removed but it is not as important as they make it out to be.
B009E2WX3W|4.0|\\"Sledgehammer\\" and \\"Big Time\\" are my favorite two songs on this CD or album or whatever they call them these days.  This item is a little misleading to me as there are actually more songs on this 25th Anniversary Remaster than you are getting for this price.  If you look under MP3 songs, there is a whole slew of them listed that are not on this particular \\"CD\\" that I purchased.  I would suggest listening to the first 30 seconds of each song before you make up your mind if you are not familiar with the song or his music.  You can download the whole CD and then pick and choose which ones you want to put on your Ipod or other MP3 listening device.  That's pretty much what I did, I chose a few and left the rest off.  I like some of his music (especially \\"I Shot the Monkey\\" which isn't even on this \\"Definitive Collection.\\"
B00992CF6W|3.0|I love minecraft and play it everyday but the pocket edition needs more items I under stand that its new and that its still developing but I needs more. Ps I do own pocket edition :-)
0525958002|5.0|This book brought back so many good memories for me, and actually made me go to Itunes to download some of the fabulous music DD has created that I haven't listened to in years. I also couldn't put it down and finished it within a day.<br /><br />The book is raw, honest, funny and sad. I felt there was a little held back, and I understand that.<br /><br />I sincerely hope our beloved JT has found his peace and his little slice of happiness.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Arrived on time! Intact! Has everything you could want for this movie! Can't wait for the second one! I dunno what else to say.
B00992CF6W|1.0|first off, it should be less than $1.00 and should be more of a challenge for people who like challenges. you should be able to ride and raise animals like cows horses and sheep.
034580404X|5.0|This was a good book. Couldn't put it down. Kept waiting to see what they were going to do next...wow.....  I bought the set for my niece as a wedding gift.
B0060D16VI|5.0|My son has been so into Disney movies since he was 1yr old and Ofcourse he was just 6months on his first Disneyland theme park visit... My choice of picking this movie was the perfect one for him.....!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Came in fast, came in safe, ordered to the person that i sent it to.  Everything was followed as told!
B005ZMTXMY|5.0|This is one of many Disney/pixar great movies and hope they  continue there great achievements to show kids and like us adults who sit with them to enjoy a weekday even a weekend movie. Let's not forget we are all kids @ heart! LOL... Well, this movie still gets my 2 thumbs up and 5 magnificent stars.. you won't regret buying it or renting \\"UP\\"......
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I give this game 2 thumbs up. lots of games to choose. from. I highly recommend. dwnldng &amp; playing. this game
B002N14GPE|3.0|If you're thinking of adopting an older child, you might want to think twice, then a few more times, because some kids come with more luggage than you bargained for. The orphan in this movie, a nine-year-old girl from Russia named Esther, is very bad. And that's part of the problem. She's too bad too quick; a fact that, even given the big revelation at the end, strains the believability of the plot, which is otherwise both engaging and plausible.<br /><br />My favorite character is the little deaf girl, Ester's new \\"sister\\". She's just cute. But I also like the parents, particularly the father Ester plays the role of daddy's little girl to while former alcoholic \\"Mommy\\" raises her eyebrows in dreadful suspicion. It's a silly story in the sense that not enough reason is given for all the extreme things Ester does when she does them. But it works well for what it is; essentially just another psycho killer thriller.<br /><br />marcellee.com
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Avengers was certainly entertaining! It is a success of CG and the marvel comic line of narratives. I give it 4 stars because the 5 star category is reserved for those films that go past just being entertainment and instead for those works of art that provide a canvass of meaning to the viewer. We can only take so much of the hero/heroine category -  which we get ad nausea and it is indicative of the lack of unified leadership in America and the loss of a sense of common goodness to strive towards. Maybe that is reading too much into it.
B009QW6ZT8|4.0|I can tell their still working on setting us up for a big season. I can be patient, not saying the episode was bad just slower, for now. Still a great show.
B007TNS6JI|1.0|the game is ok but nothing special. kinda fun but not that  great to be honest<br />could be better with better controls or aiming
0425263908|2.0|I loved the Fifty Shades of Grey series. I was excited when I learned of the Crossfire Series and immediatley ordered Bared to you. The book started off very good. But, it was not long before I started seeing many many similarities between Fifty Shades of Grey and Bared to You. I began to get turned off with the book because all the author did was change the name of the characters but all of the personalities of the characters were the same in both books. This author is obssessed with Dominanct/Submissive acts. So, if you read Fifty Shades of Grey then you've read Bared to you!!!!! Save your time and money!!!
B000085RPU|1.0|I bought this movie new, but it will not play on my DvD player. I have tried several other players/machine to play this in & it will not work in any of them. I am very disappointed with this product. When I was looking at it on Amazon, it didn't say it was not compatable with any system.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Wow - for a free app, I am seriously impressed!  I downloaded this app because I was debating switching internet service providers and I wanted to see if I could get more out of my current AT&T U-verse service.<br /><br />I used this app on my Kindle Fire HD to check for interference, and was surprised to see everyone in my apartment building was pretty much on the same 2.4 Ghz channels.  This app showed me which channels would be best to switch to - which I learned how to do by doing a quick google search for \\"change channel\\" and my router model  - and now instead of 15 other signals interfering with mine, there are 2 (upstairs neighbor and manager's office next door)!  Using speedtest.net for before and after testing, my download speeds (all around 7pm) went from an average of 2.3 Mbps to about 2.7Mbps.  Revolutionary - not really, I have cheap internet - but I have noticed a decrease in the amount of buffering stops when streaming HQ youtube videos on my iPhone 4S.<br /><br />It also helped me consider my home network in the future, as I noticed the channels on the 5 Ghz band were not being used by anyone in range.  Note to self, if I ever purchase my own router, I'll get a dual-band capable model!<br /><br />This app also works great when traveling and there are multiple wifi options (airports, malls, etc.), as it will help identify the strongest signals available to you.<br /><br />If you are looking to optimize your wifi usage wherever you go, this app will help you do that - for free!
0739352989|5.0|I am only at fifty shades of gray cd.It is worth buying epecially if your married.Thiswill boost your love life.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|Loved the book. Finished it in 2 days.  I was surprised by the ending.  Although it was not as capturing as other love stories that I have read, I really enjoyed the book.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|I was very pleased with the quality of the decals. I let my 4-yr old granddaughter put them on her wall. I moved a few of them and they were very easy to move and did not leave any residue. I also bought the Cinderella castle for their room. I have always been pleased with the price and quality of anything I ordered from Amazon.
0761158820|5.0|This is a wonderfully produced item.  It punches  out without tearing (8 year olds).  The paper is heavy stock.  All tabs are numbered as are the spots where they go.  Like the other reviewer I recommend the glue dots- they are perfect for these projects.<br /><br />You and your child will be delighted.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|works for me.  Easy to use and plus its free. I keep it on my kindle and use it multiple times a day
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book to read. Every woman should read thus book.  All my friends have read thus book and live it.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I am very happy with my purchase.  The this package has it all: The Bluray, 3D, DVD, and Digital Copy versions and as an extra it includes the soundtrack for downloading.  The picture clarity is wonderful, even on the DVD copy (I checked).  It's just like being in the movies.  My family enjoyed watching it in the theatres, and now we can re-create that experience at home.  Fantastic actors, great director, and a fast-paced plot that tells the viewer a little more about each character/superhero.  Definitely one of my favourite movies.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book for me made me appreciate Sylvia Day a little more. When I read the first crossfire book I was a little apprehensive because I saw so many similarities between fifty shades of grey and bared to you. Although in reflected in you I think Sylvia finally decided to come into her own and may a book that is not a reflection of the fifty series. For me reflected in you was addicting and left me sad knowing the next book doesn't come out until may. The ending of this book is the best part, makes you feel good inside. Gives you hope about the power of true love.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is totally addictive and so much fun to play. Its challenging but not too challenging. Best. Game. Ever.
030758836X|4.0|I really enjoyed this book!  The author is sharp, witty, and outrageous at times.  I, too, would recommend against being swayed by any of the negative reviews, some of which were written by people who just didn't seem to get the humor and irony.  Yes some characters were caricatures, but I believe that was Gillian's intent; she has a great sense of the absurd.  Good, strong writing and impressive intellect.  A real page turner.
B005K17RU0|5.0|omg works well.I use this app everyday when I need to know the weather.I wish it were 100% accurate .
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|so fun and addicting. so simple to put down. i try to play everyday when possible. i love that the coins regenerate and it feels good whenever you get a coin drop.
