B000MQC9H4|4.0|I love this film. It's a great holiday movie, as well as a good movie any time. It's also a nice feel-good piece. Plus, Jude Law is always a plus.
0765325950|4.0|*Includes Spoilers*<br /><br />I am sure there are fans who will never be pleased.  And it is impossible to complete something like this perfectly.  But this was a great effort to end an impossibly long and complex series.  The major threads were completed and most of the minor ones were as well.  There were some great and surprising scenes.  Great battles as well.  Most of the characters stayed true to their development.  There were few wasted moments in the book.<br /><br />Yes, a book by RJ would have been different and perhaps better.  But we shouldn't forget that there were some books authored by RJ himself that seem to stretch things out and push the series further rather than closer to completion.  The first 6 were outstanding.  In the subsequent books however, there was too much dialogue and elaborate descriptions of character clothing.  Sanderson should be congratulated on a tremendous feat.<br /><br />Some downsides of the last book include a pace that was so quick that it was hard to follow the action at times unless you reread sentences.  Additionally, for me, it seemed like the description of the Dark One, at times, veered a little too close to his villain in his Mystborn trilogy.  The final battle between Rand and the Dark One wasn't what I had anticipated and was far less physical that I was expecting.  However, that may have been the way it was anticipated by RJ himself.<br /><br />As with many of you, this moment was bittersweet.  It's great to have a conclusion.  But it was always exciting to have another book coming out every few years.  We were all much younger when this started and we all matured so much while the series evolved.  I will miss the excitement of a new book.  I am glad however, that they were able to find someone as conscientious as Sanderson and that they were able to bring this to a close.<br /><br />Enjoy!!
B0002JJBZE|5.0|Essential viewing. It forms the bedrock of all learning and understanding. Teach yourselves by watching TOS, teach your children. All three seasons, all 69 episodes. And keep up-to-date by refreshing at least once a year. Like the Koran.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|I read through the whole thing after surgery so I'd know what to go back and follow. There are so many nice tidbit in here, and it's true that it's not really meant to be read through like a novel lest you get overwhelmed.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|i love all of John  Gresham's work, this book was no exception.  If you've enjoyed any of his other sroies you are sure to love this one.
B003YOEXUM|5.0|OK, so I hate buying albums that are only listened to once.<br />Most reviews were 5 stars, and none of the old Accept albums are better than 4.5 stars.<br /><br />Once you start this, you can not believe how great this sounds.<br />It is old metal, with a current sound (the recording levels, and overall sound quality).<br />Imagine, Judas Priest Painkiller, Pantera Vulgar, Overkill (any album), Sepultura Arise, Megadeth So Far So Good all smashed into one.<br /><br />Buy it.
030758836X|5.0|This tense thriller will have you on the edge of your seat, unsure who to root for with its alternating perspectives. This mystery offers chapter-ending cliffhangers and differing voices (between characters and also within characters, depending on the stage of the book). Masterfully written, not for the weak at heart, nor the prudish, 'Gone Girl' wraps with an ending that disturbs and satisfies all at the same time.<br />Lisa Ard<br />Author of 'Saving Halloween' and the Dream Seeker series
B00AREIAI8|4.0|my 5 year old daughter loves this game. She likes to pet and take care of the horses.<br />Good game for kids.
0446343129|5.0|Anyone who is interested in their health should read this. Easy to read, entertaining, and informative! I agree that sugar really is  like a drug!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Awesome my kids and I race to see who better and they love beating Mom. I highly recommend helps with memory retention. Have fun with the family.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is so awesome so far! :) I love horses, but they are a lot of work. This is great if you love horses!
0778328821|4.0|I especially liked the way the story is told from the point of view of each of the four main female characters, who are all described clearly, so that it is easy to visualize them and their lives in your mind's eye... I felt as though I knew them, and certainly wanted to.  Some of the romantic resolutions were thinly believable, and others were strong.<br /><br />And while romance was part of the theme, it also involved relationships between sisters, parents and their offspring, and friends... and the development of strong friendship ties among the four very different women, ties that could only occur in unique circumstances such as the knitting circle, is touching and gratifying.  We get to see beyond each of their outer defenses into their hearts, minds, and souls.<br /><br />Twice, when apparently obvious and trite solutions to dilemmas did not happen, I was relieved (it would have been boringly easy) and very pleased at the original ways that they were resolved.<br /><br />Easy to read, flowing, gripping without too much drama, this book will make women want close female friends if they don't have them, value the ones they do have, and be open to women whom they previously had thought were too different from themselves.
1594744769|3.0|If its eerily eccentric cover didn't make you want to pick up Ransom Riggs' latest young adult work, then it's highly possible the contents of the pages between the front and back flaps won't make you either.<br /><br /> Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children by Ransom Riggs is a story about 16 year-old Jacob Portman's voyage to a small island in Wales to discover the truth behind the outrageous stories his late grandfather told him years before and to find peace with his grandfather's sudden death.  When Jacob and his father arrive at the island, it seems that all hope in uncovering a sliver of truth to his grandfather's tales might be completely lost. It's not until Jacob finds himself entangled in the lives of Miss Peregrine and the children, all possessing very peculiar talents, who live with her that he discovers more about his grandfather's past along with the truth about himself.<br /><br /> Personally, I didn't get what I wanted out of this book at all. I picked up a copy, having admired such a distinctive cover, and bought it without knowing absolutely anything about the plot. This is a true testament of judging a book by its cover. I thought the story had potential once I began reading, but I soon realized that the old photographs Riggs placed throughout the pages to enhance the story constantly distracted me. I also thought the general plot was very spastic and random. I felt like I was being told a story that was being fabricated as it was being told to me.  Many elements of the plot were both confusing and inappropriate, in my opinion. In general, the book was too mentally exhausting for a book of leisure.<br /><br />My favorite piece of the novel was the interesting use of collected photographs. Most of the books I read do not include pictures of any sort, so it was something different. The photographs added an element of realism to the story because I was shown what I should be imagining rather than just having to go off a vague description. At the same time, though, I felt limited on what I was able to imagine. I read to use my mind, and I quickly established that it wasn't so easy to do while reading this particular novel.<br /><br />While I consider Riggs' originality quite refreshing compared to what I am accustomed to reading, it really wasn't my cup of tea. If I hadn't bought the book based on the bizarre cover, I probably wouldn't have ever thought to read it at all. It's apparent to me why this book spent 63 weeks on The New York Times Best Sellers list and why it engrossed so many readers, but I will stand by my own judgments to say that not every writer is meant to write children's or young adult fiction.<br /><br />Overall, based on plot and overall presentation, I give Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children 3/5 stars.he same time, though, I felt limited on what I was able to imagine.

B00B2V66VS|2.0|keep losing all my coins can't buy any upgrades or new characters. like the new scenes especially like the mines and zip lines
B009U9S6FI|3.0|I found the first half of the book enlightening but had a hard time getting thru the second half.  It was so technical that I found it boring.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book with so much color. I can't wait  to read the next book.<br />This is one  you must !
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|An interestingly developed plot line bogged down by gratuitous foreplay. I was disappointed in the read overall. Much too fluffy for adult readers.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|don't start this book too late at night or you will have to read it all and really be tired at work. this book and the movie drag you into the adventure John Carter was made for. this is Tarzan on Mars.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It's okay, but it could be better. There is way more glitches than the first one. (I guess it makes it easier to cheat) The game is very sensitive which just makes it harder, but overall it's okay. If it was me I'd download it and delete it just to know what it was.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|the Doyle inside of many of us is challenged to come up to the best of WHO DONE IT. i belive a DOYLE  lived inside my English teacher and cannot immagine not reading this collection.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|This movie captures my interest on several levels and it's rated multiple views per week.  The performances, music and setting are all compelling, intriguing and somehow addictive to me.  I own Hunger Games, anticipate the next installments of that franchise and can't wait to view Silver Linings Playbook.
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|i bought 4 of them, well they are great and works as mentioned but one thing that its not right if you use the sticker that comes with it, well it will not last long it will fall from above, my recommand is to drill one small whole and that will do<br /><br />other than that the item is a good quility
B003WH765U|5.0|One of my favorite movies. Enjoy watching anytime. The acting of everyone from Red Buttons to Patricia Owens was simply superb. And the countryside was stunning.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Enjoyable game. I love those little birds and so does my husband. It's a challenge to win all the downloads of these little birds, but it's fun.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It's Downton Abbey! Yes, I paid to see it! It's one the best shows on TV! I am attached to all the characters now and have to see what they are up to.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Amazing. I love reading it before bedtime. I hope to read more books when I get a chance. Love it.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|It isn't often that I find a book that resonates through me the way \\"Eat. Pray. Love.\\" did from the introduction. I decided I needed to read this after seeing the movie adaptation of the book, knowing there was lots the film's producers had cut out or changed in the effort of making the story good for the big screen.<br /><br />I must say that her story of self-exploration - of finding herself after losing her sense of self along the course of her life - spoke to me. I mean, everyone has parts of them that they lose over the course of years, but very people are willing to admit they'd lost their entire sense of worth and didn't know who or what they were any more.<br /><br />When she talked about spending night after night on the floor next to the bed, just crying because she was so unhappy and didn't know what to do, I immediately knew exactly from where she was coming.<br /><br />Although I have hundreds of books in my \\"to read\\" pile, I will most likely start the second half of her story next - I cannot wait to find out how her self-structured, self-rescued fairy tale ends.
B0063IH60K|5.0|My husband and I enjoy playing solitaire on my Kindle. I look forward to playing more games on my Kindle.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I just love this game, and my children do love it too!<br />It is very well done for being a free game.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I considered giving this book five starts but simply because  I hate cliff hangers I gave it four. Lol. This is  are all intriguing read. It only took me two and a half days to read it. That's a first for me lol.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Bought this for my daughter's Kindle Fire HD and it seems to work very well on the device. When using as a stand it holds up very well. The corners of the Kindle do not slide on the gripping surface. The elastic strap keeps it closed tightly and has a very nice feature that brings the Kindle out of sleep when opening it. Yes you can not charge it while in the case the standard way with the camera on top but my daughter just takes it out of the case while she is charging it at night. And if you aren't going to use the camera very often it is not a bib deal. Does not add a lot of bulk to the device which is nice.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This is like most of Grisham´s books. Good twists every so often. Flows easyly and keeps your interest throught the book.
B0095P3ULC|2.0|They should have stopped after the first film.  More bad acting filled in with fighting sequences that are way too long.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|As you know, Mohjong is a tile game, and this one is very good.  There are many multiple tile setups, and elements that make this version a keeper.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|Beautifully filmed, this documentary is a fascinating look at the life of a man who is not just a supreme chef, but also a master artist. Though he is certainly human, and not without his flaws, Jiro remains an exceptional individual (and one with a superhuman resistance to mercury, apparently, considering that he's constantly sampling fish throughout his workday).<br /><br />Jiro's life philosophy can best be summed up as \\"the relentless pursuit of perfection\\". He has such passion for his work, his calling, it is truly inspiring. To have been doing the same work for 75 years (yes, 75 years!), and to still be filled with passion and excitement for it, is thrilling to behold. Though he has clearly perfected his craft (by any reasonable standard), complacency is not in this man's genetic makeup. With all his success, ability, and fame, he remains committed to excellence and the highest level of quality, and it is in this passion that he finds his happiness. He is like any practitioner of zen, achieving enlightenment and tranquility in the process of his art- be it painting, flower arrangement, or in this case, food.<br /><br />I also greatly appreciated the perspective that Jiro provides concerning sustainable fishing. He has been in the business longer than anybody (literally), and his insights as to how the fish populations have transformed over that time, due to over-fishing, are both fascinating and alarming. His son sums it up best when he points out that sushi used to be a delicacy, but now you see it everywhere- even in gas stations and on conveyor belts (not good sushi, mind you!). Here's to harvesting fish at a sustainable and responsible rate- and to the relentless pursuit of perfection.
034580404X|3.0|It wasn't all it was cracked up to be - somewhat disappointed after all i heard about this book :(
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game really challenges you hand eye in a unique way. I am very impressed with the graphics. nicely designed characters and if for sale i would buy this game for sure. but since it was free......and I look foreward to more games from you guys.
B0053O89WY|5.0|OK all of you hardcore The Big Bang Theory fans or all of you Wanna-Bees.

The fifth season may be one of the best yet, so go ahead an drop some cash and<br />get this three disk masterpiece.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|Wanted this CD from the one of a kind Ray Charles. Great songs. Listen to it often. Good duets. Very enjoyable listening.
0385504209|5.0|After all the hype about the movie and the Church's reaction to the book's premise, I finally broke down and bought the book. Good read. Makes you think.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|I actually got tired of all the fighting, you could have summed up the entire story in 5 minutes without all the shooting.
B00846REIS|1.0|No originality.  Very predictable and repetitive.  My bookclub's rating average was 4.5.  Book could have been shorten by 120 pages.

B000YMMN04|5.0|Love the movie!!! It will recommended to others. We watched on amazon video demand, it has good quality and sound.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Trying to go through my mail and delete want I don't need and the app seems to be having trouble doing so, it is quite glitchy to include the menu and options bar that doesn't seem to present itself when appropriate.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|An entertaining and informative look into the &#34;dark&#34; world of some of our military specialists.  A &#34;Joe Friday&#34; narrative, just the facts, little to no fluff.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I enjoy this game. It is fun to play. It is not as much fun as I thought it would be,but it is fun.
B0085Y4JF0|4.0|pretty good for training, its worth the money, Im 6*4 290 and its loose. holds  8 ar mags 6 pistol mags and has molle to strap your first aid and a pistol. I use the mag pouch on left side for good cross draw and tight retention,holds up to more than light use. comfortable.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It's a awesome book I think they should make  another one all the other ones are cool to you should check them out
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a great game but a lot of stuff costs gems, which cost real money. The competitions are the best part plus the training leading up to them.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's awesome I wish they made more games like this it's amazing I just can't stop  playing it so addicting
B0064X7FVE|3.0|This app is okay but not great.  It gives you some info but the map doesn't always animate and can't get all the info needed for the weather.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I just love this game!  It is so much fun!  Not as easy as you would think so there is a challenge.
0525952926|5.0|I haven't finished it yet, but I am completely absorbed in those pages. Unfortunately, the people who should be reading it are so deliberately uneducated and so counterproductive that Germany's horror could repeat itself.
1419705849|5.0|This book is for my 10 year old daughter. She currently has 7 other Jeff Kinney novels and she got to meet him at a book signing last fall. She says she loves his stories and she would highly recommend them to kids her age!
0446554995|3.0|I am a huge fan of Preston & Child and especially the Pendergast books.  I can't tell you the number of people I have recommended this series to while working at the library.  Two Graves isn't on par with the others in the series.  It's still a wonderful, thrilling read but it lacks something.  It seems to hurried in places, too disjointed in others, and a little wacky in between.  I think the character of Helen and what becomes of her might be part of the problem.  I don't want to give anything away so I will only say I was unhappy with the Helen situation.  I also didn't like D'Agosta not being partnered as much with Pendergast.  I think they work well as a team by contrast to their styles and while Pendergast is a fascinating person, he appears even more so when surrounded by regular types.  I was also thrilled to see Corrie Swanson back but then she has her own plot which didn't really intersect with the main action.  She really should be included with Pendergast and D'Agosta in the next one.  Constance and her storyline and especially Dr. Felder's adventures were rather compelling.  I had no idea where it was going and was happy when we got to the end of it.  All in all, I would read it again, but with lowered expectations.  It is a good addition to the series, just not a great one.
0439023521|4.0|I started this and was not really into it. About 1/4 of the way through I started looking forward to each chapter. I guess I'm hooked. I'm getting the 2nd book.
B007N5YIUS|2.0|did not play on my tablet. the download went fine, the file is on the tablet. It will not open.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed this book as I did the other two.  It was nice to see how Ana and Christian complement each other. Now we wait for book four.
B00A3DZ61W|2.0|will not run on my tablet. It has been checked and loaded on tablet but will not open. do not know what to do.
B003JTHXOK|1.0|I rarely don't finish reading books but after the husband discovered a letter of his late wife which was actually meant for his future girlfriend (and how much she blesses her in the letter), I closed the book and threw it in the trash. Awful. Unreal and very cheesy. I can't believe they are making a movie out of it.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Very suspensefull and well acted.  We had heard a lot about the series and now can heartily recommend it to all!
B009HV2JT8|1.0|Neither goofy nor satiric. Just a plain dumb concept in order to make a buck.<br />What will Hollywood think of next?<br />\\"Elizabeth: drag queen\\"? \\"George Washington: wigged martian\\"? \\"Adolf Hitler: borscht belt comedian\\"?
B001KZG99A|5.0|This is a good put together movie.  The beginning was very well done.<br />Good vs Evil<br />greed vs doing what is right or better for other/unselfish<br />defeat vs hope.<br />Adults will understand this movie better than children and may be too violent for children.  Not that they can't watch when they get to an age where they can understand what is going on and why.<br />I really liked the movie.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|The price on this flucuated a lot, but I got it at what I felt was a fair one eventually.  Big hit with the Star wars fan in the house.
B009ZQGNPQ|5.0|I love this show.  While it is definitely a \\"period show\\", it is new and fresh to American audiences. The acting is superb, the cinematography is beautiful, and the story is spellbinding.  I am a huge fan, and I cannot wait until the next episode airs.
B006BG7RI0|5.0|More than perhaps any other film from the 1940s, Casablanca stands the test of time and holds incredible power and emotion for what should be any generation. This blu-ray box set more than does justice to the film.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|a lot better than the first one the first ins great but this is the greatist it blows away the first one if this ishow good two is then im amazed because most of the time the first one is better but not with temple run two
0877180121|2.0|I thought this would be a good tool to home school but too hard to follow for a 6 year old.
1451696191|3.0|Being a teenager myself in the early 90's, the movie based off this book caught my attention and, since I try to read the book before I see the movie, I picked this one up. It's really short and written in the form of letters which makes it a breeze to read. I was able to finish it in just a few hours.<br /><br />The book takes the form of letters written by Charlie to his &#34;dear friend&#34; and follows his freshman year of high school and what a year it was. I loved the 90's references to television, movies and lots of music. What teenager in 91' wasn't in the process of making a mix tape in the hopes of pouring out our soul to anyone who would listen? I think the references are what made this book worth reading.<br /><br />What kept this at 3 stars is that Charlie's POV left me slightly confused. He's 15, a freshman in high school and a bit of a misfit, which makes him a typical teen of this era. The problem is his voice isn't consistent. I felt like I was reading the narrative of an 8 year old who is living the experiences of a 20 year old. He cry's A LOT! And not just in private. It makes him seem much more immature then the actions he participates in.<br /><br />What's good about Charlie? He's extremely perceptible to the emotions of the people around him. He's sensitive, respectful and kind. He has thought's that are beyond his years yet is so awkward and nieve. He tries so hard to please everybody and has to learn to live for himself and not others. Charlie is endearing but wholly frustrating.<br /><br />Charlie's friends are diverse and wonderfully unique. A hodgepodge of raging hormones and teen angst, they give Charlie and the story purpose and direction.<br /><br />In my opinion, the author puts Charlie in way to many unlikely situations. The situations themselves aren't unlikely, but the sheer number of them are. How many 15 year olds experience all of these themselves or by association in one years time?<br /><br />If you enjoy atypical coming of age stories or dated references, this is a good fast read. Be prepared to be pummeled with life experiences, some of which are not &#34;perks&#34;.stories or dated references, this is a good fast read.

B002ZTIIXK|5.0|For anyone who is a K.D. Lang fan this is a great collection, especially if you'd rather buy just one CD- instead of a dozen, each with a couple of songs you like.
B00913DPW2|3.0|I purchase for my son, and I think he likes it a little, as he plays it only for a while.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|as far as angry birds goes, this is a stretch to make money from the name. This game is aggravating and not at all what I expected. glad it was free
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I highly recommend this book. Susan Collins did a great job writing the final book. It was adventurous, sad, exciting and just simply awesome. I love this and I really was satisfy with the ending. I just cant wait for the movies to come in theaters.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|my toddler loves this - puzzles and trains. the balloons at the end of the puzzle are added fun for him
B003O86FMW|5.0|I started out reading the trilogy when I first watched the movie. By watching the movie it sparked an interest to read the books. Catching Fire was an excellent read, it kept me interested and wanting to know what happen to the characters in the story. It literally pulled me in the story and made me have feelings for the characters. I definitely recommend this book.
B008NMT684|5.0|my toddler loves this puzzle game. ended up buying full version. the balloons at the end of the puzzle are fun too
B006OEPITO|5.0|Received instantly on my Kindle Fire. Just in time for my college course paper. This book help me with my research on Siddhartha.
B00AKYRCNY|4.0|not much to this game, but great for toddlers. makes sounds that go with the vehicles, so that is fun
B005HSL626|4.0|Fast and instantly on my Kindle Fire, Iphone and Ipad. I recommend this app. it is fast and convenient to be able to play one of my favorite games on the run.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|as far as angry birds goes, it's the same basic concept. the gravity effect makes for more challenging play. don't care for the eagle aspect of it. some level down right infuriating trying to conqure
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I first watched the movie and was intrigued by the way the screenplay was written, so I bought the kindle fire version and never been happier. I loved the book more than the movie, it has much more details than the movie. As I read the book I was pulled in by the characters emotions, which I think the author Susan Collins did a wonderful job keeping the readers eyes on the book. I recommend for anyone to buy and find out more of what happen in the story.
B009NIJNLW|5.0|Best movie I have seen in quite some time. Looked ridiculous in it's full 1080p glory on my projector. Even with mediocre conditions in some of the locations they brought this film together with creative camera work, a lineup of great riders, and dialogue to keep it emotionally available. I cannot watch Art of Flight enough!
B006I1OB0U|1.0|If you saw season two... Or ordered it on DVD, this comes with it. You don't need it as a special item. Very disappointed that the season two DVD, which I ordered, did not state this was included.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I enjoy all the temple run games. This one is fun because of the  zipline! There are gems that save your life and other new cool features. You will love it like we do!  :)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I don't really know what else to say, this is an amazingly written and directed show and the Amazon Prime feature makes watching it on my Xbox so easy!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Better then the first temple run.  I just can't stop playing it!!!!! I love that its looks cooler then the first one too.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am obsessed with this app! I love it SOOO much. I dont know what i would do without minecraft!!
B003FNWR6Y|5.0|I bought this game because I love playing board games with my friends and family.  I played this game last night for the first time and I can say first hand it is a great spinoff of the classic version of monopoly.  You can play it like the classic version as I did.<br /><br />Some things to point out are:<br />1 - the moving tokens are not what I thought they would be (mario, luigi, peach, etc).  They are actually items from different nintendo games.  For example, there is a sword, a samus helmet, one of those tree like things that were in animal crossing that you would save the game too, etc.  sort of disappointing but I quickly got over it.<br />2 - The items you can buy are the characters from different nintendo games.  There are no longer places like in classic monopoly, but characters you can own.  Characters are grouped together in groups of 2 or 3 depending on what game they are from. For example, you can own wario, peach, kirby, samus, king dedede, link, etc.  And of course, mario and luigi.  The railroads and utilities are still in the game, but they are items such as piranha plant, gunship, mario kart, etc.  The free parking space is still in the game, as is the jail system.<br />3 - The cards that were used in previous monopolys are no longer named, now they are block cards and a question mark card. Each card has to do with a nintendo theme such as save the princess collect 100 dollars and so on.<br /><br />This is a great game for nintendo gamers, especially younger children.  If you were having a problem getting your child into games involving money and skills, this game might be good at that since the would be staring at nintendo characters on the board, as well as mario images on money and cards having to do with the game. But My friend and I are both in our 20's and we had a blast with it as well.  If you liked monopoly, you will sure like this game as well.  If you have a nintendo fan in the house, or are one yourself, you will probably like it a bit more.<br /><br />One thing I felt the game lacked was the number of hotels and houses they supply you with.  there is not many at all so you may need to use a creative way to mark properties off as we did.  not a deal breaker but kind of annoying.
B000002VSN|3.0|I loved the movie, and ordered this for the song, Imagine a King,<br />well, for that one song it was great, but all the other songs weren't what<br />I liked.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a good game that can keep people entertained for hours on end. I definitely recommend this to horse lovers as it is a very good and addictive game.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Have to have this movie in your Christmas Collection. When you need a<br />good laugh, this movie is it. Good condition and plays like a charm..
0307950654|5.0|I really like the format of this book.  Eventhough it is a paperback it is of high quality and will last for a long time.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|Great movie!  Just like a Disney original! I would recommend for the whole family!<br /><br />P.S. If you like this, check out the &#34;Once Upon a Time&#34; TV series.  You'll enjoy it.
B004T32SOK|5.0|I can't do my job without it!  A great solution to working in multiple locations. Easy to use and I haven't had a problem ever with it.
0783230079|4.0|Normal everyday people go about their normal lives when...  their lives are cut short and they realize it as their ghostly embodiment.  Thinking, it can't happen to me, a small group of life-shortened ghosts are attached to Robert Downey Jr as a little boy to adulthood.  The ghosts interact with the boy through his life journey to adulthood.  The problem is part Downey Jr's and part ghost's fault.  They both have to figure out a way to make both his life a moral success and the reason the ghost's are trapped before heading to the pearly gates.  Amusing and interesting!
B009GXHOW4|2.0|I can not find a save button or mode for any inventory edit that I do. There is no back icon available on these screens.<br />I have paid version of Minecraft PE. I have original Fire. If someone can tell me how to save an edit, I will increase the stars, maybe even buy the pro version.<br /><br />edited to comment:<br />It does work on my HTC Vivid phone, which has a permanent \\"back\\" button, which allows saves. The pop-up back button won't pop up on any screen that requires saves on the Fire. So this should not be certified for that device.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This same package was for sale at our Best Buy for much more.  This pack has everything a Sound of Music lover would want and then some.  First thing I did was download all the music to my computer and my iPhone.  The stories in the books are very interesting and the pictures are fun to look at.  I would buy this again in a heart beat.
0307454568|5.0|Book was in fine condition; pages all fine, a minor crease on the spine as warned. Fantastic. I'm almost done with it now.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|At first, the new richer graphics became a little too much, but once you get used to it, it's as fun as the original one.  The game could benefit from carrying over stats from one device to the next.
B001EYU1VO|2.0|Right out of the box a few of the button were lose but it didn't seem to effect game play/function. This was only a minor annoyance compared to the present. Now I have no rudder control to the right at all. I paid for a product that basically only lasted 6ish months..
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read this book MONTHS after I finished Bared to You.  I was really glad that I didn't have to refer back to Bared to You to remember everything.  This book gave enough details to jog my memory.<br /><br />This book was SO exciting, full of many twists and turns.  SO much better than 50 Shades.<br /><br />The only CON is that we have to wait for the 3rd book!  You'll finish the book and say to yourself, \\"What?!  It's over?!  Now what!!!\\"
1557048630|5.0|My kids wouldn't put this book down. They are facinated by those skecthes. It's great to have something to hold on after watch their favorite movie. Great book.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This novel is a fresh original story filled with interesting well written characters. This is not a dull stuffy Victorian era novel, it's modern contemporary fiction. From the very beginning you are invested in the main character, wanting to know more. Great read.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I don't regret purchasing season 2 at all! Some of these longer shows start to go off the rails and stretch out to ensure they can meet show requirements. I believe the plot (for the most part) stayed in tact. This season did a good job of adding a lot of human emotion that the viewer can feel.
B002DQDV6Y|1.0|We rented this movie for my daughter and her friend for their sleep-over movie. The download did not work. It kept stopping and really ticked off our daughter and her guest. I had to resort to streaming the movie from one of those free illicit sites........It is so sad that a free illegal service works better than a legal paid service. Amazon, please get your act together on this. We had to stop using I-Tunes because the sound would never sync up with the action when streaming a rental. We don't go to the free illegal sites to cheat anyone out of their $, we just want something that works. Looks like we will be sticking with free sites for a while. You know what would be awesome? If Amazon actually read this review, fixed the problem, and then contacted us to let us know it has been fixed. If it actually happens, I'll update this review. Will it happen? Stay tuned!<br /><br />Well, it's about 6 months later and, apparently, some people have found this review helpful. Sadly Amazon has not. We have a 20mbps cable internet connection and sometimes the Amazon rentals just don't work...... There does not seem to be any method of contacting Amazon for any immediate attention.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I think I like this version on my tablet better than the facebook version except that version has power ups and this one doesn't..

B00B2V66VS|5.0|The new temple run is even better than the first one. It has lots of new features including ziplines and where you ride a cart inside of a cave. I highly recommended you buy this application.
B00421IR5I|4.0|My daughter takes French in school and saw this in her class.  She wanted her own copy so we purchased it and I had the opportunity of watching this delightful film. It certainly captures the innocence and the precociousness of childhood.

B004J4WKTW|1.0|I'm 65% through this book, The Night CIrcus.  If I didn't belong to a Book Club I would have quit a long time ago.  This book seems to be going no where.  Characters keep appearing, but i don't see much of a plot.  I just keep reading about different charaacters, thier actions, magical motions and circus tents.  Folks in my group say the book is better the last half , but I'm still waiting.
014241543X|4.0|I feel for the readers who picked up \\"If I Stay\\" soon after it was released, because the ending is one of the most breathless cliffhangers I've ever read.  I'm happy that I have the sequel, [[ASIN:0142420891 Where She Went]], right here beside me.<br /><br />\\"If I Stay\\" is a story about the value of life.  At what point is life no longer worth living?  Seventeen-year-old Mia must find these answers when a devastating car crash kills Mia's parents and leaves her with life-threatening injuries.  She detaches from her body at the scene of the accident, and she sees the corpses of her parents and her own mangled body.  But where is her little brother, Teddy?  She sees her body brought to the hospital as the doctors and nurses frantically work to save her.  As her friends and family visit, Mia gathers information and observes the reactions of her loved ones.<br /><br />The plot moves back and forth in time from Mia's unconscious state in the hospital to recollections of earlier points in her life.  These jumps in time were sometimes jarring, and they sometimes seemed as though they were being relayed by a reporter rather than by Mia herself.  I understand these scenes were necessary to give us a sense of the importance of Mia's loved ones and to let us know what she has already lost, as well as what she stands to lose if she also dies.  I just wish the scenes were conveyed with more emotion.  I found myself much more interested in the present hospital scenes and wondering if there was some other story-telling device that could have been used to relay Mia's past.<br /><br />Much of the focus is on Mia's boyfriend, but I really didn't \\"get\\" them as a couple until a heart-breaking scene near the end when Adam speaks to the comatose Mia.  This was a short scene, but so wonderfully written that I had to reread it several times.  Mia's relationship with her best friend, Kim, by contrast felt true and solid.  The \\"reporting\\" scenes established that wonderfully, as well as the bond between Mia and her family members.<br /><br />I should be going to bed now, but I won't be able to sleep until I see what happens with that cliffhanger.ond between Mia and her family members.<br /><br />I should be going to bed now, but I won't be able to sleep until I see what happens with that cliffhanger.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|I'm having fun with it but there are somethings that need some improvement, like the small gifts, once in place cannot be moved to adjust space
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Fell in love with Holder!!!!! Love this book wish it never ended.<br />Totally worth it please buy it you won't be disappointed.
B006MR2ZQC|5.0|very entertaining!my grandson spends a lot of time playing with it. He loves it. I would recomend this to a friend.
1616550414|5.0|I can't believe this only cost $20 the content that this book contains is amazing. The manga in the back has great artwork and first few pages are colored. Kind of wish that the rest were but i can't complain for $20. I don't get how anybody could give this less than 5 stars
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I can't stop playing this game so entertaining and fun.  Makes me laugh each time I play especially when I run into the wall (lol).....

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Just starting playing this game so far it is fun my boyfriend plays this game on his cell phone so i thought i would try it too
B008133MDK|3.0|I'd recommend skipping the second episode. It was pretty stupid in my opinion. But I loved episodes 1 and 3..
B00A4FOWYQ|4.0|To me they were always pop - you know, clarity of feeling, brightness of sound, hooks, melody - i.e. the good stuff, so easy to sneer at. So it makes me think that their big theme is the perfectly executed A chorus and B chorus, and love is what it is, even still at 32.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book it's sad, it's got a little bit of murder. I also love it because once you read a chapter you just want read the whole book without stopping. I love this book so much.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I have just started watching this series, and I love it.  There are so many interesting subjects in this series.  I love it.
B003K1EYM6|2.0|I could not get the reader to work. Not too sure if it was my fault or if it was defective
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I love this series, So glad I got it great acting and have enjoyed it though the packaging was a little bit flimsy caused damage to outer box.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I was able to read it with my son. It was a great story that made an awesome opportunity for Mommy son time. It appeals to both adults and children.
B003K1EYM6|2.0|Did not realise this item would not work with my iPad 4 (description not clear). My bad for not confirming it was appropriate.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A hard game to put down.  I got my husband addicted to it quickly too.  Good for brain stimulation and challenging.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun game for anyone who loves horses it helps to have an app like this when I cant be around my own horses
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Like most everyone who doesn't live in either Australia or South Africa, where he was huge, I'd never heard of Rodriguez before last year's documentary, Searching for Sugarman, now nominated for an Academy Award.  His two recordings, Cold Fact and Coming from Reality, were made in the 1970s, have been reissued.  They are staggeringly good--his streetwise views of Detroit contrasted with idealistic and touching songs of love and memory.  One can hope that, sooner or later, we'll have some of his more recent output recorded.  He's 71; he's fragile; but one can hope.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Bob Dylan, Kris Kristofferson, Keb 'Mo, and Warren Zevon, these are for you.
1400069289|5.0|Our leadership team at work is reading this book right now.  Although we're finding practical applications for our team, we're also finding personal applications as well.  Most of the examples we discuss come from our live outside of work.  It's nice to find a business book that spurs great discussions and enables real change.
1609611543|5.0|I ordered this book over a month ago and before I finished the first chapter, the pantry and fridge were cleaned of all processed wheat crackers, flour and bread.    Dr. Davis has changed my life. This is not a diet!  I have been a faithful vegetarian in the Midwest since fifteen years old because I wanted a lifestyle change. I could skip over all the meats, and double up on the dinner rolls at family functions. Looking back, I was severely addicted to wheat. My vegetarian morality was shrouded in wheat addiction.    I was skinny fat a month ago. My stomach was  distended and big although my arms are toned and slender. As of today, a month later, I have lost ten pounds mainly around my midsection.    The weird rash on my arms that I grew to accept  has vanished. My shape is changing. I look younger. I do not have to eat constantly.    Dr. Davis goes indepth with the material because the science exists. Wheat can be contributed to a myriad of problems and life threatening illnesses. Looking back, I am thankful because all of the information shifted my outlook to see the truth about this poison that is the base of the government's food pyramid.    I have devoured cheese, oils, chicken and pork this month. I also have not refrained from corn, oats, potatoes or dark chocolate. I seriously only cut out wheat! Although, I do find that these items seem less and less appealing.    Please opened your mind to a wheatless lifestyle and order the book!    UPDATE:  10/12/ 14    I have followed this diet for awhile now. I never went back to eating wheat, but I have to admit that I don't follow all the advice in the book. I eat homemade corn tortillas, potatoes, and rice quite a bit. I gave up sugar for honey.    Anyway, I went from a snug size 10 to a size 2. I have curves; I never realized how petite my frame is. I went from 160 lbs to 123 lbs. I have not exercised in five months because of a very serious injury. Despite not exercising, I am the same size before my accident!

B005LAJ1O0|4.0|I just purchased the first season of AHS. I watched the first three episodes all back-to-back. It's a wonderfully creepy and twisted story with a great cast. However, I must inform anyone who has not seen this show to NOT watch the pilot episode with director's commentary until they have finished all the episodes. There are tons of spoilers that will ruin the experience for anyone who absolutely must remain in suspense about what's happening as they are watching. Other than that, this show is genius.

B0086700CM|4.0|This is a fast paced game that the kids love.  Its a little too fast for my aging eyes and hands but gives them a long playtime.  Well worth it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The book and series has much more than the kinky sex everyone first explained it to have. The deep emotional contact between Ana and Christian and the dramatic and suspenseful events of this book will make it so you can't put it down until it's finished

B008HK3XU4|4.0|I love the color of the case, and it has held up well so far (I've only had it for a month).  My only complaint is that the kindle fire does not remain in an upright position as shown in the picture.  It doesn't bother me enough to make me purchase another one, but it can be annoying at times.
014241543X|4.0|A beautifully written story of the life and death and the power of choice through the will to live.  Can love save you or bring you back for the brink of death?  Can it give you the will and desire to want to live when you know that the pain of choosing live is too much?  I absolutely loved the way this book was written.  It is a simple read but there is nothing simple about it...it will stir your heart and make you excited to read Where She Went (which is better if that were possible).
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I JUST LOVE THIS APP.  IT KEEPS EVERYTHING IN ONE PLACE FOR EASY VIEWING ON MY KFHD.. ONE WORD DESCRIBES IT...GREAT... NO NEED TO SAY ANY MORE :-)
B009AMALGM|5.0|I had actually forgotten that I had pre-ordered this movie, so when it showed up it was like a surprise present to me from me! The feel of this movie is different from the other 3 where you knew for a fact who was being targeted.  It DID have an &#34;OH!&#34; moment that took me by surprise and there were several visually stunning moments.  GOOD movie!

B00AYB20KI|1.0|Not fun, not scary, not entertaining, pretty much not even worth the text I'm writing about it. Only upside to it is being able to see Jennifer Lawrence looking good throughout the movie. Other than that, don't watch this terrible movie.
B002IKLZZY|5.0|VEry happy with product, beautifully presented and the shipment of the item was very fast. I really enjoy this very entertaining movie.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Nice game...Good graphics, decent story. I can seethis game will game will take some time to master. It reminds me of Diablo.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing this. It is my go to time waster.  Just wish there were no adds. Guess I should buy it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I decided to get this book solely because I had heard the movie was ok.  I ended up reading the trilogy straight through and thought it was well worth my time.
B005LAII08|5.0|This was the first movie that my daughter ever saw in theaters.  She loved it so it was a must have when it came out on DVD.  It is a very cute Disney princess movie that breaks the mold from falling in love with a prince!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The graphics are soooooooo coool and a little confusing at first but hen u get used to it and its better. then they added a zipline and its wool fun!!!!!!!!!
B004GVUPFE|3.0|It's a good game, but gets overly complex quickly so I quit playing.  It needs to teach you some ways to solve future levels.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A whole new take on the post-apocalyptic theme, these books slowly unravel a tale of mystery and suspense, following each characters path as they slowly uncover the well-hidden secrets of their underground home, and their very existence, that will change the lives of every surviving human on earth.
B009POCG2C|5.0|Clint Eastwood always comes thru in his movies.  I love this movie and have watched it 4-5 times.  Thanks Clint for another great one!!!
B000O178BY|4.0|This album finds NIN more introspective and pointed...gone are the songs that seem to just lash out, even the anger is tempered.  With Teeth fits my mode more, as the songs themselves are well constructed but don't always stick in my mind.
B000CDO330|4.0|I love our Schleich animals.  They are well made, and so fun for pretend play or for just holding in the hand to play.  I think my kids will get many years of play out of them (currently age 4 and 18 months), so i feel they are worth the somewhat hefty price tag,although i do wish they were cheaper.  This giraffe is cute and looks great.  One really minor thing is that the giraffes ears are really hard and pointy. Not at all too sharp for regular play, but sometimes when we have a big jumble of toys on the floor, i make sure to move the giraffe out of the way so that the kids dont hurt their feet by stepping on it barefoot, or get poked while rolling onto it.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Very much liked this book. Kept your interest from page 1 ....the characters were interesting and the book was well written. Would liked only to know more about the life of the eldest daughter ...who more or less was telling her mothers story. Pick this book up. Very easy  reading. Janet B.

It's unique in that its basis is that former presidents are a great source of inspiration, support and trust for those currently in office.  No one else can really understand the pressure that most presidents are under except those who have &#34;been there&#34;.  It offers the reader an insight into the presidency that I don't think is available anywhere else.  Sometimes it seems to get involved in a bit too much detail and what I thought were minor situations but on the whole it's a great book if you want to see a different side of the presidency.  Despite their differing political leanings, they were/are all able to support one another because unlike anyone else they &#34;understand&#34; each other's situation better than probably anyone else.  I was surprised how often they turn to each other and how much they no doubt appreciate this support.
B005K01VZS|3.0|It is a good book, the story is interesting and you can read it in a couple of days. I would say that it even is a little bit inspirational and you will definitely feel touched by some of the events. Anyway, I didn´t grade it with more stars since I´ve read better books by Mitch Albom, I don´t think this one is one of his best.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Well, it's just not really about anything is it. Most of the movie is taken up with Ed Norton trying to explain to everyone they could persuade to come back from the original movies, why they had to kill the operatives. They all looked bemused, as they might, I certainly was. So, its better to wreak havoc and carnage with news crews and emergency services everywhere than allow people to - this is where I got really confused - see a video clip on YouTube of two old men drinking wine (which, even more bewilderingly, they already would have as its... duh! ...on YouTube)? If you &#34;did&#34; recognized these guys and joined the dots then you would already be in the know right? Who knows? Who cares? Anyway, Jeremy Renner runs away, and that pretty much sums it up. Was it just me or did anyone else think it turned into Terminator II at one (brief) point?
B009D0LBRO|4.0|I used to play this game all the time when i was a kid i still love it it's so addicting
B00005N6RU|1.0|The DVD did not play in my blue ray DVD player or my laptop DVD player. It was like it was for a different country
0765325950|5.0|I'm not done reading this book yet, but so far, its one you cant put down unless you absolutely have to. Action filled as you could expect, being the Last Battle and all... but also it has managed to give me chills from chapter one. Will try to update this after I'm done. But if you are a fan of the series... you have to finish it. If you aren't yet familiar with the series but are a fantasy fan, I highly recommend!!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Greatest game ever.I think everyone should get this plus its free! It's so addicting because it's just that darn fun
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is entertaining and a step towards every child's dream for owning and taking care of their very own horse. Amazingly addictive and hours of fun
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Christiana good game for parents and kids.  It's challenge.  You only get 3 hints-which I didn't know.  It's great when you are sitting somewhere waiting on your kids.  :)
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Installed and connected with Google calendars easily - and has continued to work well for several weeks now - thanks for a great product!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's a great show with high quality. I love this show and I would extend this to other people totally
B000BTC5LW|5.0|With or without Waters, watching/listening to this on my home theater was a trip down memory lane when I saw these guys for the Division Bell Tour. If you like Pink Floyd music and want to \\"relive\\" their live performances, you should also try Roger Water's [[ASIN:B00005U122 Roger Waters - In the Flesh (Live)]] DVD set and David Gilmour's [[ASIN:B001BKG9SK Live In Gdansk (2 CD/2 DVD)]] Happy listening!
B0061S073A|3.0|Turning off the kindle. Then turning it back on gets you out of the app so you still have to keep a eye on them.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|Right down my isle. If you like action movies with modern technologies twists, this is a great choice. Would watch it again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing this game and this is one of the best ones I have played.Great for keeping your mind sharp.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|It's a bit weird and much less funny than I expected. Ultimately it is just another chick-flick with a strange teddy-twist.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game by far to me is the best game on the kindle fire HD just amazing who ever hasn't played it should
B000FC130E|5.0|If you like Steven King and Clive Barker, ever wanted to visit the places you read about in Everville, The Talisman or the Gunslinger books, Neverwhere is right up your alley.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was under the impression from the beginning of the book that it was a whodoneit.  There is a surprising plot twist mid-book, and after that point I think the novel went downhill.  It's also difficult to tell a story with one of the two protagonists being unlikable.  You lose interest in her at some point.<br /><br />That said, Gillian's &#34;voice&#34; is fresh, she does the difficult trick of using two protagonists and their point of view quite well, and it's a unique type of mystery novel.<br /><br />I didn't love it, but I was glad that I read it.  I think others may embrace it more than I did; my expectations were high for this book.  I'd recommend it for entertaining literature, beach book or a refreshing change for people who like serious novels.
B008VBYN80|4.0|Ok game exeped for the fact that it's kinda hard to get friends.otherwise it's realy good game.also add me _ gabo331
0062200909|5.0|A superb book for fans of the Hobbit. Great details about how sets and characters were created from start to finish. Wonderful drawings and so much more plus the foldouts of Thorin's mapand Bilbo's contract are an excellent treat for lover's of this movie and for those who enjoy seeing behind the scenes.
0634022296|4.0|Love this book.  I am a 53 year old women who began playing guitar just 3 years ago and this book is perfect. I love being able to strum the chords and sing the old Beatle songs.<br /><br />The customer service communication wasn't the best but the book did arrive within the 10 day window the shipper gave.  And the book was in excellent condition.
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|Let's not beat a dead horse here.  It's the last episode in the long journey from childhood fantasy to utter chaos for the boy (now young man) wizard.  All of the hue and cry over leading children down the path of Godlessnes can be shelved for the next perceived travesty.<br /><br />The film is dark, brooding, and introspective.  Just the thing for a kids afternoon entertainment.  More of an adult adventure, but the kids who started out with The Sorcerer's Stone are now of the age where they can watch a film of this nature without nightmare.  A fitting end to a billion dollar franchise that started young people reading.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This sooo much more fun than the previous version. Great graphics, fast action make for an awesome ride. Love it!
B00723NWJE|5.0|I have every album Norah Jones has released in the U.S. (including her projects with The Little Willies), so I admit I'm biased here.  My first exposure to this project was the wildly weird music video for &#34;Miriam&#34; -- something that could have been the opening scene to an episode of &#34;Criminal Minds&#34;!  Sick, twisted, and a lot of dark fun!  With that, I was excited to get to hear the entire album, and it did not disappoint.<br /><br />I pretty much liked &#34;The Fall&#34; (2009), but I was worried that it signaled that she was starting to go too much towards &#34;hipster tunes.&#34;  But &#34;Little Broken Hearts&#34; has renewed my faith in the way Ms. Jones is navigating her recording career.  This is CLASSIC NORAH JONES!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I had the free version of this and used it for a year and really liked it. I got a new android tablet and decided to get the paid version (only $.99 so a great bargain). There is such a good variety of radio stations with this app and It doesn't stop after a while to ask if you are still there, which is definintely a plus. I would definitely recommend this program if you like listening to the radio as you work or read or just relax.
6305784116|1.0|I love Disney cartoons for the most part. Except for The Aristocats!! What was Disney thinking when they made this movie in 1970?? The story is boring and slow. There isn't anything worthwhile about The Aristocats or all that interesting. If you love cats, great, but this movie doesn't even offer a great cat story. Ugh, pass on this movie. It's not even worth categorizing as a classic.
B00026WU4G|5.0|Bob Dylan is the song writer with chameleon DNA. In this enigmatic collection one song stands out in light of his musical/spiritual (?)  conversion from Judaism and later back to it. His support of the State of Israel in  &#34;Neighborhood Bully&#34; is quite heart warming. Way to go Bobby Zimmerman!
B0002VFXFE|4.0|I used this to replace the thermal paste on a 6870 that I had bought.<br />The application was simple, just a drop on the center of the GPU, and then clamp the heatsink in place.<br />The temps went down about 6 celcius, which was perfectly acceptable.<br /><br />My only qualm with the paste was that I had a nearly empty tube to start with. I'm sure it was just a one-off, but I only got one application, since the tube was filled almost completely with air.
0767805712|5.0|This is one of the most compelling stories of the future of genetic manipulation of the human genome. Much of what is in the film is ocurring as I write this. Slow but dramatic. I've used this in classes I've taught about the social ramifications of genetic modifications.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This is a book that didn't know if it was a romatic novel, a crime novel, or what! But I kept reading- because the other reviews were so good. And yes, about 1/2 way through-it got interesting. But what a disappointing ending-not believable! This author could have done better. Blech.
B000000OE7|5.0|it must have been quite difficult to make this after freddie was gone but they did a wonderful job.  so sad
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I love my purple cover.  It is my favorite color and I am amazed at how the kindle sleeps when the cover is placed on the screen.  My techie friends and family are too.  They play with that before they play with the Kindle.  OH!  And I love, love , love my Kindle.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the game but you guys need to lower the prise on the other games of minecraft like to maby free than I can get all your guys games
B0086700CM|5.0|I love the graphics on this - looks almost 3D.  I am not very good on it, but my sons love it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|better than the first temple run was.  better setup and better characters with more fun than a man should be allowed.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|But, only if your spouse/partner is willing to read it, too. I truly belive that the advice in this book (combined with lots of work on your part) can save or strengthen a relationship.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Easy to read because of interesting story line and quick pace. Would recommend to a friend or child over the age of 13. Even though the violence is handled tastefully I Don't think it's appropriate for younger readers.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This game can be used to pass the time when waiting in line at the Doctors office.<br /> It is fun to play.
0399160450|5.0|The campus are under attack, as is the United States!  Jack Clark, Jack Ryan Junior, and the boys are the saviors!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Walking Dead and Dexter are the best shows, but how can you beat zombies?? If only Dexter could make zombies. Walking Dead rocks.
0142501123|5.0|A friend who isn't usually into children's books recommended this one to me<br />and it was a real hit with my two grandkids.  I highly recommend this title!
B00000K3D4|3.0|this seemed to me like a mixture of Wizard of Oz and present day lord of the Rings. the Classic Good vs Evil and how a girl is in the center of all this and seems to have an impossible task before her.<br /><br />I think for its time it was pretty great tricks
B007XGJK4G|5.0|Just thought this was such a great film about Bob Marley. I remember seeing the Rolling Stones in September 1981 and they were blasting \\"Get Up Stand Up\\" over their sound system in honor of Bob Marley who had recently passed away. I've listened all these years since I was a kid in the 70s but this film showed things about Mr Marley I never saw before. His music was/is a message for everyone. Check it out.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Ellen is one of my favorite comedians and her books are just a small dip inside her crazy thought patterns, which are easy to follow her from bicycle to banana an  know how she got there because my mind jumps around the same way. All in alts book was a pleasure to read.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|This could not be anything but exceptional.  Having seen the stage play and movie I totally enjoy this music as I knew I would.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app works great. Let's you know exactly when you need to plug in to charge. You will not be disappointed when you purchase this one.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Loved reading this whole series. George Martin is the king of this type of series - each book is so well thought out, the plot flows perfectly and it is probably the most engaging book series I've ever read.<br /><br />When will there be more is the only question I have!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The third season of The Walking Dead is by far the most suspenseful yet. With twists and turns, edge of your seat thrills and \\"Did that seriously just happen?!\\" endings, I highly recommend this show to any adult. And this is coming from a woman who is no fan of her husband's Xbox zombie games. (Put the preempted zombie notion aside, start with season one episode one and you'll be hooked, just like I was.)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Fantastic, creative, spellbinding, this has it all. I am looking forward to the second half of this season coming back very soon.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Anyone that love Fleetwood Mac as I do should definitely add this to their collection. It's an awesome CD and a must have.
B0001I561E|5.0|My children love this movie. It's a new classic. Just like A Christmas Story was to me when I was growing up
B00006JL1Z|5.0|It's Fleetwood Mac. What more can I say? They are a true classic band, and this 2CD set is a must have for any fan.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|well the game is really fun and this new place is so kool but there is so many glitches that make you die and I was at 5'000 coins then I played a different game then I came back to temple run and I only had 20 coins left
B0067LXQAW|5.0|The newest release was everything I expected it to be coming from The Cranberries. They are one of my favorites and I am enjoying the new release.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very inspiring, loved reading the book, it was a very real life experience. Highly recommend it to everyone, especially non believers.
B009AMAMF2|1.0|I really tried to like this movie, but I just can't. It is just horrible. Even great actors like Hanks, Berry, and Grant can't save it. I watch almost 60 minutes of it before I gave up, that's how bad this is. Do yourself a favor and just ship this one. Don't loose another 172 minutes of your life.
B0052FX6M2|4.0|An excellent description of China's cultural perspective and an intriguing, first-hand view of those early days when China and America first started to talk at the highest levels. A must-read for anyone interested in modern China.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Man what a great book super funny and silly.  I totally would recommend this to any one who wants a good laugh
B004SIP9E2|5.0|My son is really into this type of movie.  Always good for a laugh.  Not sure he understands everything but that is probably a good thing. LOL
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is amazing if your a horse lover this app is perfect and even if you aren't IT is still an amazing game
B006GLLREU|5.0|Acting is incredible, the cinematography is flawless, and the plot is an enlightening slice of life. This is one of the best shows in the history of television, such good quality  nearly compensates for the vast majority of what you see on the idiot box.
B009VB9VKY|3.0|I saw the trailers for *Magic Mike* an assumed it would be a fun, quirky girls-night-out sort of flick. Of course, my friends and I never rallied to actually see it in the theaters. Last weekend, I noticed it as available on Amazon On Demand and decided to give it a watch, thinking I was in for a cute romantic comedy type film.<br /><br />Yes, there is romance. Yes, there is all the dancing and nudity the trailer promised. But there's also a very stoic darkness to the film, something I suspected may exist (it is a Soderbergh, after all, and *Entertainment Weekly* firmly believed Matthew McConaughey was an &#34;Oscar Snub&#34;....). But was surprised at just how dark and gritty the film became at point. EW is not wrong -- I haven't seen McConaughey this layered and complex in a long time (perhaps *A Time to Kill*?).<br /><br />Channing Tatum and Alex Pettyfer are foils for one another, but it's almost too severe. Pettyfer is almost completely unlikable, while Tatum is so endearing he comes off a bit one-note. I was also a bit disappointed that Matt Bomer and Joe Manganiello weren't better utilized in the film. The film starts out with a &#34;band of brothers&#34; type feel, but that dissolved quickly.<br /><br />I think the film overall is interesting and was worth my time on a Saturday evening. But I wouldn't recommend it as light, fun, girls-night-out party fare.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|Don't like the fact that it's forcing me to give a review. Love to read to my daughter and not spend time writing this and being told how many words to write
0452298482|5.0|We have a ton of experts on life in our oldest Americans.  Through Dr. Karl's research and interviews, he brings out advice that we all can learn from our greatest generation.
0525952926|5.0|Winter of the World - I love that time in history, enjoy reading about the joys and trails that they had back then.Ken takes you back and brings it alive, they were very important times for the world!
1594487154|5.0|So many good nuggets, stories, and research driven data that you'll want to read it twice.  I loved the phrase, we shouldn't look to &#34;up-sell, we should look to up-serve&#34;.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Left our cord in a doctor's office far from home. This works just fine. Can plug right into computer to charge most quickly, or into ipod jack plugged into regular wall outlet. Doesn't charge fast at all when plugged into car USB or into an ipod jack that lets us use our car a/c outlet: Will operate unit but not store much power once car is off. FYI, it's not expensive to get this Kindle-made cord so I'd avoid some Stuff-Mart knock-off in case its not compatible or unreliable.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|great read could not put it down, very interesting, books likes these  keep you reading, i finished it in two days
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow!  This was a very good read - I was totally unprepared for the twists that it took but that made it all the better.  It was actually even better read again because you knew info ahead of time that the character didn't know.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|ok listen up. this is an amazing game. just after playing it for a day or two it completely shut down. now i cant play it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This Game Is A Lot Better Than The First One Because It Challenges You. And I Like How Real It Looks
B0063GORYU|4.0|Basic spider solitaire game.  It has only one suit available so the more difficult challenges aren't there.  I have won each time I've played.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|This camera produces great photos on your Kindle. It was well worth the purchase however I would like to be able to take photos from both sides of my product.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|LOVE all the Harry B. books - even got my sister and neighbor hooked!  Haven't quite warmed to the Lincoln Lawyer series - sure hope there's more Harry to come.
0425252868|5.0|Adam Makos did an incredible job telling the story of German pilots during WWII...a story that Hollywood has never taken to the big screen. This true story is filled with human passion and what appears to be the little known fact that many German pilots had a disdain for the National Socialist Party (the Nazis). These men did have a courageous streak however in their desire to fight for their homeland. The chivalry demonstrated by one German pilot, and the reunion of pilots years after the war was a very emotional ending to a well written book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. Great ideas for everyone and anything. It is very addictive also. love love love love love
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I read this book because my 8 year old recommended it and I couldn't put it down.  It was inspiring, funny, and heartwarming.
B00633W614|5.0|this was for my mother in law she liked this book she is a big time reader and is going book crazy now that she is reading on a Kendal.
1616550414|5.0|Originally released in Japan for the 25th anniversary of the Zelda series, this full-color book covers the entire Legend of Zelda series. After a foreword from Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto, the book starts with 65 pages of Skyward Sword, and then delves into the other games. Of course, the best part is what most fans have been waiting for: an official Zelda timeline (something that Nintendo persistently denied existed). Along with a history of the Zelda universe and games, it also explains how they came to be. There is plenty of artwork, from original drafts to the final looks of characters and locations.<br /><br />The book closes with a look at Zelda, Link, and Ganon through the years; a catalog of all the games; an afterword from director Eiji Aonuma; and a Skyward Sword manga. This book is truly worthy of being placed on a coffee table for all to see. Once you open it, you will not want to put the book down.<br /><br />All in all, if you consider yourself a Zelda fan, don't think, just buy it.
B007SGM084|5.0|Love these books. Definitely worth the money. The relationship that forms is amazing. Take the time to read these books.
B009HEMW4W|4.0|Usually the thrid movie sucks but this one is good.  I loved the special effects.  I will keep this movie.
1451695195|5.0|I have read books NDE experiences before and have always wondered if NDEs were real or a fantasy of the dying brain. It is only after reading this book that I am convinced that NDEs are real and that our souls do survive physical death. Dr. Alexander makes a thoroughly convincing case for his adventure. I would recommend this book for all who have an interest for what comes after this life.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|I watched this with my Granddaughter and we had great laughs.  I loved the Elf who could wrap anything even his head.  Very well done movie and a new must for Christmas.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I am very happy with my new Chromebook.  It does everything I want it to do and more.  Since it is only about 3 lbs., the chromebook is very portable.  Also, the instructions that come with it explain everything in detail.  It is a very good product!
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Different concept a must see for the little ones. Some of the scenes seems too adult based but overall not a bad movie.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|Loved the music.  Loved the sequence of music as it related to the storyline.  What more can I say-Barbra and Kris very<br />electric!
B009R9WAZ8|5.0|Rihanna experimented on this cd and succeeded. Her music is entertaining and sounds amazing. My favorite album is loud, but I still love the music on unapologetic.
B009SCR7RU|5.0|My 6 year old daughter has watched it 10 times in a week. Great picture quality is awesome.  Sound quality is very good as well.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My 9 year old grandaughter loved it, And it arrived within 3 days. Great children's movies. Would recommend to children of all ages.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|The only really free game app I've found so far. Sure, you still get the ads at the end of the game but at least they wait till the end. The graphics are great and you can adjust the background to have tiles Show up better. I also like trying to compete to get the best time. Overall, this is a great free app.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is no different than the Angry Birds Free game for any other device.  So, if you like that game, you'll like this one, too.
B00030EIY6|5.0|if you are interested in the new year's concert, you should get it!!!! It is very nice and the songs here are nice~~~
B006AZZPCM|3.0|While I appreciate having a app that allows me to watch the occasional YouTube vid on my Kindle Fire, TubeMate is so buggy it's only useful for watching the occasional video.  It nees to be shut down and restarted constantly.  It freezes often.  If you absolutely need to watch something and you have no other device available, it's good to have, but it's hardly as good as the real thing.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is so fun I think its much better then the first one get this app its so tu.
B00A6PD8RQ|2.0|It crapped out halfway through watching it and I was never able to get it to play again on my Kindle Fire, my desktop, or my Roku.  So, boo on you, Brave!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The best show on TV, excellent character development is what made this show so much better than other tv shows,very good acting and story line. All other shows seem superficial by comparison.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is a great collection and for an amazing price. mm m m m m m m m m m m
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Loved this darling movie, especially JD and BN and of course Sonny.  Maggie Smith's character does an about face too quickly to be believed.  Sad that all these folks are so destitute at their age.  Very nice movie.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|it was just like i rember it years ago. the quality of sound is great. brought back lot of memories
B00APUQRPC|2.0|Acting looks stiff, silly too. I expect more from these guys. JT is good, about the only worthwhile part.  Glad it was free!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Amazing! So glad I got this, can't wait to get it for the pc!!! One thing though, my friend got this knew his iPod touch and he got an update for this and it added armor, stone cutter, and other cool stuff, but I can't get the update on my kindle. Why?????
B002PJ8AE2|5.0|I purchased two for my granddaugters the kid liked them very much they made a great christmas gift , the kids really treasured them...I definitly recommend them
B007FEFLTO|5.0|After reading Fall of Giants, I couldn't wait for Winter of the World to be released.  I am an avid reader and really enjoy a book that just takes you into another world and not only gives you historical characters, but also brings all the characters into a cohesive story line.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed reading the very thoughful (maybe too thoughful reviews) that some people have taken the time to write for this book. I bought this book based on the fact that I liked the movie and that I wanted to buy a cheap book to use with my Kindle app on my new iPad. It seemed like a no brainer. Again, if you enjoyed the movie, this book is an easy purchase as it helps fill in the many blanks that the movie suffers from. Is it Hemingway? No, but most books aren't, and this one doesn't pretend to be. At the end of the day, it's a book written for young adults, but for me, the story is interesting enough. I also found myself caring about the characters - even though I knew how the story would end. Can't wait to start Catching Fire.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Rad rad rad rad rad rad rad rad rad rad rad rad rad rad rad rad rad rad is what describes angry birds
B008PCVGKI|2.0|The book is a reasonable attack on big pharma politics and will open the eyes of some of Goldacre skeptical readership. But Goldacre isn't able to see that a majority of doctors just don't care about truth, money is everything that count. Just read \\"On the take\\" by Dr. Jerome Kassirer, at least there is self-critics and not only victimization of the profession.<br />Consider also all the pseudo-scientific psychiatry diagnostic. Dr. David Healy make a good case when he writes evidence-based medicine is often evidence biased-medicine. In fact, in a liberalist perspective, there is no place for ethics, there is only interests and medicine is no exception...
B003L20IJM|5.0|This is a great classic movie, with plenty of good lessons for kids on sharing, getting along with others, and teamwork. Our granddaughter loves it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|wow love this game very addictive and it's free objectives get harder as you go but its ok challenges you more a must get app
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Force close every 5 minutes. Had to uninstall and redownload twice. Crashed the Kindle Fire. Needs to have a lot of the bugs worked out.
B006PTL1QM|3.0|Viggo is excellent in every movie he is in. Keira Knightly overacts a great deal. Overall the movie is slow.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My kids love this app and so do I. We have gotten HOURS of fun out of it. It is so creative. It is worth every penny.
B000NY12LO|5.0|This story was engaging from beginning to end. The only issue I had with it was the ending and the storyline of one particular character (Josie). Other than that it was a great and interesting read.
B00AYB0SX4|1.0|I have no idea what all the great reviews were about, I was hesitant, but decided to try it.  I wish I hadn't wasted the $4. If I could give it a negative star I would have.
1616550414|5.0|I'm so impressed with the quality and content of this book.  It was way more than I could have expected.  The amazon price is also incredible, 20$.  I can't begin to guess how many hours it would take you to read all of the included content and the gorgeous art.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I really enjoyed the Christmas special.  Downton just keeps getting better.  I'm anxious to see season 3.  There are always surprises in the story line.
B00ANY7V8M|5.0|My daughter has several of these mini colections but this one we had trouble finding in the store.  She loved this set and was very happy we found it.
B0086700CM|4.0|Temple Run is fast paced & challenging.....even though it makes me a nervous wreck, I love to see how far I can get! Great game!
B008NEVP1S|5.0|I have always listened to Aimee and this is a really pleasant surprise.  Watch the video for Charmer, it's great!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Downloaded Angry Birds to my Kindle & definitely love playing it.  Highly recommend this game & even the kids & grandkids like to play it!
B004SDSSFY|1.0|I down loaded this for my android and still have been unable to get it to work.  A waste of money.
030758836X|5.0|This is about a marriage I guarantee you will remember by an author you should be sure to remember. Give it time to hook you--you won't e sorry.[[ASIN:0985688041 CURED]]
B000V63BN6|5.0|Great Stevie Wonder collection filled a gaping hole in my music collection. Very good price and very easy to download.
B00AE2I4WK|4.0|I like the whole mob thing I think it would be awesome to be apart of seeing something like that
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app helps me remember to plug my kindle in and I like this visual more than the battery I have in my right top corner.
B007NESBK2|5.0|I had the pleasure of attending her concert last year as I do every time the band performs and I know that usually they have a dvd of the concert to follow. I couldn't wait to get my hands on the blu-ray being as though I received a blu-ray player as a gift. I already have the Sade:Bring Me Home dvd.
1577316517|5.0|Have read the book and I find these cards to be an efficient way to review and stay on the path of delivering oneself from EGO.  Have given the cards as present and really enjoy reading them.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I think this game is just how I recall playing solitaire as a child. Good options in the settings so gyou can play the game the way you like.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|The book draws you in right away.  It could be a depressing subject, but you find yourself wanting to know more about the good and bad of life through the words of death.
B0013TTLDE|3.0|Morton writes well, but after reading &#34;The Secret Keeper,&#34; I was disappointed both in this story's lack of suspense and in the characters. She furnishes the reader with telling details about the house so the title seems  appropriate. However, since I was neither intriqued by a mystery nor beguiled by a character, I gave up on the novel after only a few chapters. Maybe it takes more than a few chapters to involve yourself in the story, but I don't have the patience nor the time. There are too many good books that have been written to force myself to read something that doesn't interest me.
0440246210|3.0|I'm a big Grisham fan, but I was disappointed with this collection of short stories, primarily because the stories were too short. The stories didn't tend to go anywhere, they sized by me at 200mph and more often than not ended in an anti climax. On more than one occasion I thought I'd missed some ages, only to discover the story had ended without a real conclusion.<br /><br />A light, uneventful read with little by way of substance.
B007EECSFA|5.0|If you love suspense maintained throughout a novel, stories that hark back to WWII in London, and a well written plot you'll enjoy this book. From the beginning action I was dumfounded wondering what could have happened to create such a sudden, vicious reaction? And, like a good suspense writer, Morton doesn't disclose the motive until the end of the book, which contains  a delicious twist. This book was one of the few I've read recently that I &#34;couldn't put down.&#34;
0891419063|4.0|I'll be brief.  \\"With the Old Breed\\" is worth every moment spent reading it.  Sledge writes like Hemingway with his short, powerful sentences.  If anything, he is understated as he recounts his experiences as a Marine infantryman in the Pacific campaign.  Man's brutality to man is given its full measure in \\"The Old Breed\\" and the reader can feel the physical toll extended combat takes and an almost gravitational pull into the abyss of dehumanization.<br /><br />This is a must read for those contemplating a deliberate role for American women in infantry units and those that support the infantry in the thick of combat.  Sledge, perhaps better than any other author, shows us that war is hell.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|I got this for my mother because she remembers Dark Shadows the TV show. It's funny and entertaining. If you remember the TV show, you will enjoy this film.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Good clean entertainment.  Great fun. Feel like I am part of the family. Looking forward to seeing. next season. Robert
B006LSZECO|1.0|I GAVE THIS BOOK 1 STAR BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE THE CHARACTERS OR THE STORY LINE.  THE CHARACTERS DON'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY REDEEMING QUALITIES OR LIKABILITY.  THIS BOOK WAS RECOMMENDED TO ME BY SEVERAL PEOPLE.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE.  I AM 50% OF THE WAY THROUGH THIS BOOK AND I WILL FINISH IT BECAUSE I BOUGHT IT.
B005QUQ99K|5.0|Got this for my son for Christmas and it is very happy with it. he is 9 and he loves lego's, he had it built in about a hr and he said it was pretty easy.
B005EPFA8I|3.0|Excellent movie. Great video...must see once. Narration was a bit lengthy and monotonous.<br />Amazon kept buffering and the movie would pause due to high traffic. I will never stream from them again. I double checked my PC system, windows 7, dual core processor, 8G RAM, running programs etc.and I also ran internet speed test (cable high speed internet). All was fine but the movie kept pausing and buffering for 2-3 min. even with popout player. Very annoying.
B008X9Z4I8|4.0|The case is just what I wanted.  It is not bulky and fits into my carryon bag or pocketbook.  Love it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The whole family enjoys Temple Run 2 from age 6 to 38.  Much better than the first version and great graphics on the Kindle Fire HD.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is fun it's almost the same as the original temple run. But it has one big monkey instead of three and its a tunnel and rope that is in it plus it only have four characters instead if over five.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|My daughter told me about this book.  She loved it so much that she purchased several to give away including me.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I could buy the game but it is 7.00 and I only have 5.00. Can you have a like a special time where you lower the price for like two days. Other wise, this game is great and very fun.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love having the ease of my bible at my fingertips, and it is lightweight. Thy word is a light unto my feet.

B004RJMUJO|5.0|This app is fun and can be addicting - once you start chopping you don't want to stop.  Entertaining app

B0058VW36U|4.0|My 11 year daughter thinks this is an entertaining app however after a while she gets a little bored with it and stops playing it.
B009PF93LS|5.0|this is the best christmas cd ever. it was rereleased in 2012  with extra songs. michael buble is fantastic and a must have for anyone who loves this type of music...
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|Until u had to pay to finish the game. The puzzles were a lot of fun, really make you think and remember.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Enjoyed reading HOPELESS it will keep you interested from beginning to the end.  I liked it because it was emotionally involving that it keeps you interested in the story and the way it makes you feel for the characters.
0062103377|3.0|the book and the history is so interesting but the books needs more pictures, illustrations and color! and the cover maybe a little more hard
B000ZM1FXO|1.0|One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Kept waiting for it to get better. It didn't.<br />Waste of money.
B000FCK8ZK|3.0|Disclaimer: I have never watched the show, and I am coming at this story from position of a complete newbie.<br />I'm torn with this book. The story is totally different: a serial killer who ONLY kills other killers. How does he find his victims? He works for the police as a blood splatter expert. Wow. The story is pretty good, and moves fast and keeps you interested. So the story makes it worth the read.<br />My biggest problem is with the characters. Dexter is a serial killer. Right there he is very hard to empathize with. He is also a sociopath. Strike two. Finally, most of the plot advancement comes from 'feelings' and 'dreams' he has about the killings. So there isn't much investigation and evidence like most crime novels. The supporting cast is as interesting as a box of nails. His sister Debbie comes off as a complete nit-wit. Her actions aren't all that insightful, and it doesn't help that Dexter's internal dialogue keeps saying things like 'why can't anyone else figure this out?' while talking to her. Detective LaGuerta is more of the same, but with no redeeming qualities (not only is she dim witted, but abrasive, short-sighted, and overly political).<br />I'm looking forward to the second book in the series, only because the concept is good, and the characters can evolve as the series progresses. After all, the story is what keeps you coming back.
B0058DRUV6|4.0|I got this book for a college class on the Kindle...then I realized referencing is a bit difficult w/o page numbers. Hope Kindle soon gives the option to use pg. numbers and locations. If I put a magnifying glass on a paper book, the font size changed, but I am fully aware that I'm still on the same page and the book has not exponentially increased in paper.
B0072OFM28|5.0|Another epic season of Spartacus.  Great scenes, great script, and great action.  If you're addicted to Spartacus like we are, you won't be disappointed!
B00B16WZBE|5.0|\\"It's My Life,\\" \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood,\\" \\"We Gotta Get Out of This Place,\\" \\"House of the Rising Sun,\\" \\"Don't Bring Me Down,\\" and so many more.  Eric Burdon and the Animals were a very unique and original band and his later work with War and on \\"The Twain Shall Meet\\" (\\"Sky Pilot,\\" etc.) is also quite unique.  These songs were much deeper, more raw and gritty than a lot of what was being played at the time.  They were fantastic and many of us have never stopped listening to them.  I listen to this day, I play guitar and sing \\"House of the Rising Sun\\" frequently and it never gets old to me...I love 'em all still.<br /><br />And now the old man looks back and marvels that he has survived (as do many of us) and shares a bit more with us.  Proof that creative expression can endure.  There have been some very middling releases of EB material over the years, so it is nice to be able to say that this new release is not of that sort, but is indeed a serious effort worthy of a listen.<br /><br />The set opens with \\"Water\\" an introspective rocker which sets the tone for what follows. \\"Memorial Day\\" recalls the hit \\"Monterey\\" to me and is a good song.  \\"Devil and Jesus\\" is a nice rocking blues.  There are some surprises, \\"Wait\\" is a particularly touching and poignant love song that is quite beautiful - it's one of my favorites so far. \\"Old Habits Die Hard\\" is a real rocking blues number than brings back the 60's Animals vibe. As does \\"In The Ground\\" while \\"Bo Diddley Special\\" lives up to its name. \\"27 Forever\\" seems to suit the theme of this CD pretty well and echos a bit of the opening number.  \\"Medicine Man\\" is another early favorite as I get to know these songs.  It's one of the better produced songs, I think, and features some very nice vocals by Eric.  Like his earlier work, these songs tend to grow on you with repeated listens.<br /><br />The digital download includes a nice PDF booklet that has the liner notes, pictures, words to the songs and a few words from Eric as well as the credits and so on.  Nicely done and well worth having.<br /><br />So, here is quite a nice collection of songs by an acknowledged legend that will not disappoint.  Well worth the asking price.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />2013-03-02 Update: Came back and raised my rating from 4 to 5 stars.  The more I listen, the more I like this CD.  Wonderful to see this artist still turning out work of this caliber.  \\"Memorial Day\\" is excellent and very timely.  Lots of good song writing and that 60's vibe throughout. Nice.<br /><br />2013-03-08 -See comments for a list of personnel performing with Eric.  Quite a few.c as well as the credits and so on.  Nicely done and well worth having.<br /><br />So, here is quite a nice collection of songs by an acknowledged legend that will not disappoint.

B001P06GX4|5.0|Our family of four (with 2 elementary school aged kids) has loved this game!  Our 2nd and 4th graders have no problem with strategy, and it's great fun for the whole family.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The graphics are gorgeous, and there are so many minigames to keep yourself occupied with. There are so many different types of horses and ways to customize them!
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|I love the movie so I have to own it! Great for Saturday morning sleeping in! Highly recommend it! Enjoy!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I pick this game to play whenever I have short periods of time. Definitely not boring and the graphics are great.
B000J103PC|5.0|I love the movie so I have to own it! Great for Saturday morning sleeping in! Highly recommend it! Enjoy!
0596805888|5.0|Really good book with tips and tricks for scientific cooking a b c d e f g h i j
B000QCS8TW|5.0|great reading, is better then the series on HBO...i would recommend it to my friends and relatives...i would buy more books from this author
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Just what i needed, perfect for travel, easy to use and set, really like the color display/sound options best of all...
1426308469|5.0|I bought this for my great nephew for Xmas. After he had opened all his gifts I was surprised to see him go back to the book! He is a Dino fanatic! If you know a true Dino fanatic this is a must!
B0081BU42O|3.0|Banks is better than this book would indicate. The plot is stretched out to unnecessary lengths.  As a sci fi geek I rate this in the mid class of space operas.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|well worth getting. sometimes the tiles are a little to small on my kindle but over all i really like this game and this version is great.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|I'm sure many people have commented on the deep storyline and characters.  I'll ad a quick two cents to the special features.  I was surprised to find out the castle actually WAS a hospital during WWI.  And, it was fun to see the interviews of actors our of character (and, in many cases in modern day outfits).  Just ordered Season III
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love it! best game I have ever played so much fun. not just for kids for everyone. my new fav game
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A little lame at the end...but overall a great read.  Takes some great unexpected turns.  A well-crafted story with interesting characters.
B002PEP4SC|3.0|I love the TV series and found the book fun and entertaining. Not sure however if I want ro read any additional Richard castle books
B0029XFNA8|4.0|One of my favorite movies as a child, I had to get this. The up-convert quality is great and I couldn't be happier.
0786956127|5.0|Quicker than I expected, perfect handling and package. All I could hope for. I was surprised by the amount of time it took, I mean, how quick it was than I expected.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This is a master story teller.  Sometimes the scene is almost too vivid in its detail, but the twists and unexpected happenings are riveting.  The conclusion leaves you wrapped in the mystery of this unbelievable journey and its outcome.  Now to see the movie!!!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|i downloaded the app to my kindle fire today and played it once. i thought the game was good and i liked it. but when i tried to play again the app wouldn't open. i thought maybe it was my kindle so i tryed opening my other apps and they all worked. this app is glitchy :/
B00A2LFXVI|4.0|I give it four stars largely because it does not tamper with Frank Miller's inspired story (this is easily tops the other two ie. Batman: Year One and Batman: TDKR Part 1). The animation was very slick, and they include just about all of the scenes from the very edgy story (including the opening scenes featuring the Joker's new female bodybuilder girlfriend \\"Bruno\\"). The feature is not without its flaws however, particularly the surprisingly horrific voice acting. Peter Weller is beyond awful as Batman. He almost single handedly ruins the movie. He sounds more like Superman's crusty old curmudgeon of a boss at the Daily Planet, rather than an aging Dark Knight. His performance was downright jarring at times, particularly vis a vis the actor who voices Superman (who does a terrific job). Micheal Emerson's Joker is not nearly as bad, he just isnt that memorable, either. Another minor irritation is the voice actor who does Ronald Reagan -- it doesnt sound like the Gipper in the least. I do a better imitation -- or at least I did back in high school in the 1980s! Miller includes Reagan in this story because of the former President's remarkable duality -- the harmless old fuddy duddy charm with his incessant \\"wells\\" and references to his own wife as \\"mommy\\", masks a terribly strong, menacing and highly xenophobic character within (and a possibly a corrupt one). But the voice actor responsible for Reagan doesnt seem understand this, and so Reagan comes across as just another generic old white guy. So, yeah, apparently the legendary Andrea Romano, responsible for hiring voice actors for DC Films, is mortal after all. She totally drops the ball on this one.<br />The near catastrophic voice acting aside, I would still recommend at least a single viewing of this film, because the Miller story is that damn good.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this has amazing graphics and wonderful twists and turns.  Still like the original but this one is fun to use.
0887307280|5.0|I must say this is on my top 5 business books ever, along with Delivering Happiness, Tribal Leadership, Good to Great and The 4-hour workweek. Highly recommended for anyone that has recently started a business and wants to grow it
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I really think that this game is iight nothing more<br />I really think that this game is iight<br />I really think that this game is ok and iight
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Couldn't put it down - read it all in one sitting.  Grisham's knowledge of the law, twists and turns of plot, and great writing style make for an incredibly exciting read.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|so far so good. entertaining fun cheep for awhile Then you pay.. worth it .other games just as fun must have.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|A taut, well written story, a real page-turner.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a fast-paced action story.  The author's empathy for his subjects is touching.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|Bought this for my husband who was having major problems hearing the TV. Used it and my TV Volume went from 25 to 6. My ears feels so much better!!!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I liked it but it was too short. it had a nice pace and decent story line. g5 does good games. cant wait to play another
B0020BUWX2|2.0|This book had what could have been a good storyline. Depressing of course but still heartwrenching. I did not feel that raw emotion though. This book jumps from past to present and takes place over a 24 hour period. We did not have time to love Adam and Mia or even Mia and her family. Relationships need to gross for a reader in order to truly feel their loss. It ends with a cliffhanger so even though I couldn't wait to finish \\"If I Stay\\" I am forced to read \\"Where She Went.\\" Hoping for more in the sequel...
0765342294|5.0|I went into this series with no idea what I was getting myself into. It ended up being an incredible ride, Ender's adventure is one of my favorite new series!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Kept me entertained and busy for many hours. Definitely worth the small price for the full version. Looking forward to similar games from the same vendor.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I still can not get logged on using ,my account.  I just gave up and have not tried anything else nore have I requested help.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Love it! This is the best movie series! It also comes with the online Flixster license for each so you can watch streaming anytime you want.
B009NCM248|3.0|There are a few great songs on this album.  Absolute Zero is my favorite.  Wish it was a more complete album though.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I wish they can tell us when our updates come out because the ipad and iphones have 6.0 gives armor u can make animals have babbys also they have better d pads
B009FOBMBI|3.0|Just not as complete of an album as some of their earlier work.  There are a few good songs though.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|I was so disappointed when I got the Sex and the City complete series for Christmas. There were multiple episodes that would skip and some would not play at all. I thought maybe it was my dvd player, but I tried another one and it was the same thing. I even tried it on my computer, but that did not help. I thought maybe it was a fluke and I sent it back and got a new one, but I still had the same problems. I love watching this series and it makes me sad that I can't watch every episode without it freezing or skipping :(
B00571F26Y|4.0|Can be a little heavy going on the chemical processes, but it's important stuff. Definately changed the way I eat, and the way I look at processed food products - and I feel a lot better for it.
0465022227|5.0|People who undertake doctoral study tend to want or expect to have an academic career of teaching, studying, writing, publishing and making a contribution to their field if not to the world.  While they may get the technical training that they need to succeed in their field, especially as students, they often don't get the training that they need to survive in the job market, which is tough and getting tougher.  This small book focuses on just that missing information and does an excellent job of it.  In 10 relatively compact chapters author Peter Feibelman provides wonderful advice on what students need to do to survive graduate school, to develop professional skills and contacts, and to position themselves for the academic job of their dreams.  He covers topics such as choosing a mentor and an advisor; postdoctoral work; preparing and giving presentations; publication; the comparative merits of jobs in academia, industry and government; what to expect from job interviews; grant proposals and funding; and establishing a research program.  Finally, he ends with a short checklist of reminders.  Feibelman himself refers to his advice as common sense, but it is really only common sense to someone who has already been through the process.  As a useful guide it provides a \\"road map\\" to follow. Doctoral students and recent graduates should read it, and then re-read it on a regular basis.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|My only issue with the alarm is how close the snooze button is to the shut off option. Not the best of ideas. Definitely use a back up alarm if you use that option.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I love these movies and will watch them over and over.  I had the first 3 on VHS.  It was nice to be able to get the complete set on Blu-Ray at a great price.
B002RSQGQK|5.0|This is a truly wonderful, gripping film. Not much to say beyond that. One of Hitchcock's finest in my opinion.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I think this book was interesting.Most of this stuff didn't happen in the movie.It was more than I expected.The witch didn't say,I`'ll get you my pretty and your little dog to.<br />Overall it was the best book I've  ever read. L.Frank Baum your a great writer
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game had some fun games. But most of them were stupid, and half the time I thought I was playing a Nintendo 64 game
B005LAII3U|2.0|Great movie, but very poorly recorded audio on the blu-ray disc.  Seems to be a common problem with this movie release.  Search the web.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book really shows the struggle that a person may ensure and that will power will keep someone moving for a long time. I would recommend this book to someone who is trying to seek God or trying to understand him. This book is truly inspiring!
B00785P2QC|4.0|It took me a little while to get the hang of the game as it reminds me of Sim City. Addicting once get used to it. I don't like that you can't really progress without buying invest points or city credits. I also dislike the Facebook tie in.  I don't do social media so I can't get some free points or credits.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Only the best spectacular game ever and this is coming from a 10 year old anyway this game rocks awesomely
B009FXIICK|5.0|A refreshing rewind of the bejeweled game you find online.  I enjoy playing it each time just to see how far I can go.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Fantastically believable and filled with enticing and interesting factual information. The relationships set on by the perfectly flawed characters delves deep into the interactions we have as humans and displays the complexity of life through multiple generations. I am eagerly awaiting the conclusion to this epic trilogy.
1457514508|4.0|I liked this mystery.  It started well and the characters were believable.  You were introduced to each member of the community and their dogs.  Then they all decided to eliminate their rivals...and they all went with the same company of hit men.  The question was whose contract was going to be accepted... The end was quite a surprise!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Absolutely could not put it down! The best book I have read in a long time. Can't wait for the next one
B0052RDHTM|4.0|The two stories were unbelievable and realistic. enjoyed them both.  wondering where is the third book ..it is a trilogy, correct?  Have my husband ready to start the first two..
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|It actually has a story line, is challenging but not impossible to do. The free app goes you<br />4 chapters.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Interesting..very thoughtful..alot of detail to the happenings..quite interesting..plot very good..I thought the author gave a great deal of thought to the plot..intriging..dissapointing ending
B005LJKEXS|5.0|Chalk me up as another satisfied customer. The cable is a great value. I'm using it to shoot photography &#34;tethered&#34; to a computer.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|Love this series. Can't believe that dweeb Tom Cruise is playing Reacher. Blasphemy. I recommend to anyone who loves an easy fun read.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Outstanding read. Couldn't put the book down. Very fascinating to learn about one of the most brilliant minds of the technological revolution.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|Larger than life is the feeling I gained from the characters in this lovely series.  Life lessons gleened from each episode, I enjoyed the journey.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have been waiting for temple run 2 to come out for kindle fire. it is finally here. I luv it!!!!!! :)
B0090EIILU|4.0|I thought this film was pretty good...kept me watching and laughing as well...I would recommend as a guy flic or
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome. Don't know where the time goes when I'm playing it. Super addicting and fun. Very realistic.
B005MLP71Y|1.0|I'm a huge Seinfeld fan, which is why I watched this film...but even the kids didnt like it...it's full of adult humor, mostly Seinfeld type humor that the kids just didnt get...I would not watch again
1616550414|2.0|i'll be brief as im not much of a reviewer.<br /><br />this whole thing feels like a giant cop out. ive been playing zelda games since i first saw that gold cart for the nes.<br /><br />it brushes over all the older stuff and really focuses on the brand new stuff. its hard to be a 'historia' without any history.<br /><br />looks good. thats about it.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Will Ferrell hits a home run with this seasonal winner...great family entertainment during the holiday season..a must see...dont miss out
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is sweet.  Download this app. You need this app.  I LOVE playing it.  The whole point of the game is to take care of a horse.  This app is great!
B00APUQT7I|5.0|this is yet another entertaining Ice Age that is a must see...the kids loved it and I enjoyed it as well...we've watched it many times
B003ZHR6SY|5.0|Aside from being an excellent children's movie with amazing animation, its attention to detail is outstanding.  We are raising our child with Spanish first and this was a perfect choice.  The language track choice can be easily selected when the movie starts.  They also have a French track.They even translated the written words (signs) in the movie to Spanish!  This is a very good story and one of my child's favorite videos for over 1 year.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This was my way to organize our wedding with all of the best ideas.. all together in one place!! I would recommend this app for everyone!
B0086700CM|5.0|I think this is the best app I have ever gotten in my entire life! I just love it like loveeee!!!!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think all your books rock I am a huge fan of your books especially the third wheel .I give you a 5 star rating !!!!!!:-)
038572179X|1.0|The only reason that I forced myself through to the end of this book is because it was a gift from someone.  (I'm guessing they tried to read it first and decided to re-gift because it was dreadful.)  The author has some perverse fascination with describing every tiny detail of every scene, no matter how irrelevant those details are to the story.  Three pages for a woman to decide which dress to wear.  Not kidding.  That's all that happened, for three pages.  I got through the second part by reading 2-3 sentences off of each page. The majority of it is entirely useless.  It is impossible to like any of the characters, in part because the author did not make me like them, but mostly because I was so angry with this book I didn't care what happened to any of them.  Any sympathy you might have felt for Briony vanishes with the self-aggrandizing ending.  I am just so glad to be done with this book.  I think I deserve some sort of literary prize just for reading it.
0545265355|3.0|Read the first two books with ease, the third I couldn't finish. If you want to read all of the books, I suggest you purchase this.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Not great, but good. I didn't expect the ending, but it was sort of romantic. The end of the book really did not leave me feeling like it was a good ending. I felt hurried, reading that Katniss went  on to be a mother and wife. Definitely feel like there is more of a story there. So many tragedies to so many characters that I wished had lived. Well written, lots of unpredictability.
1577314808|5.0|this book really did change my life. I read it very throughly and I want everyone I meet to read it too. This book was delivered and I was so excited.
B0063GORYU|5.0|quick fun game. of course it can be challenging.  depending how you set up the game.  most of the time I like the quick fun game.
B0080IVBJI|5.0|Very interesting.  Kept me wanting to know more.  Liked the variety of scenarios and real life examples.  Gives you ideas to apply to other areas as well.
1419705849|5.0|My elementry school age daughter loved this book. Could hardly get her to put it down! Can wait for the next book in this series!
B003O86FMW|5.0|unexpected, gut wrenching, insightful, clever.  Suzanne Collins knows how to keep you wanting more in this book.  Can't wait for Book 3!!!!
B009IH0ICG|5.0|Great gift for my son-in-law!  Happy with the smaller size to go with the Smokey Joe ....  good quality product.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|One of my faves!!! This is Absolutely adoreable. That much better on bluray! Who wouldnt want to see Gene Kelly on bly ray??
030758836X|2.0|Really enjoyed the book.....didn't want to put it down.,....then the ending came, and was SO disappointed!!!! Ugh!!!  Wish she would've ended it better
0786958731|4.0|Great game, though it is a bit on the easy side compared to Ashardalon and Ravenloft.  The lack of a healer archetype is a bit of a let down, but characters are interesting otherwise.
0765325950|5.0|Over 20 years and it's finally wrapped up.  You get some final politics and maneuvering interspersed in all the action, but MAN is there a lot of action!  If they tried to make this a movie there would be a 7 hour battle sequence...and I'm shooting on the short end.<br /><br />I, for one, enjoyed every minute of it.  There were enough surprises, heroic moments and tragedies to make you feel like the ending does not come cheaply.  And the ending itself was enjoyable.<br /><br />Also, kudos to Jordan/Sanderson for not going the Tolkien route and wrapping up the denouement in less than 20 pages! There is a part of me that, after 20 years, could have spent an extra 100 pages on wrap up, but I think that would have cheapened everything.<br /><br />All-in-all an excellent ending to an overall outstanding series, even factoring in the slowwwwww 7-9 segment and the unmitigated crapfest of #10.  Great job, and if you've come this far, of course you're reading it!
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|I have heart throb and the new Imagine Dragons on just can't get enough (replay)! I get lost in the music, I imagine I will know all the words shortly!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Very enjoyable game.  Hard to put it down.<br />Good plot and interesting characters.<br /><br />The graphics were well done.<br />Some of the hints were useless.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|This was an awesome movie! Music and laughter! Loved it! My hubby even liked it even tho he said it was a chick flick. Lol!
0547884591|5.0|Admittedly I am already a fan of Tim Ferriss' approach to most things he teaches, but this book exceeded my expectations. I call it an adult choose-our-own-adventure book. I was able to go to specific topics I was particularly curious about and apply what I learned within minutes. There were so many unexpected extras included as well! My picky-eater (teen) approached me after dinner the other night to say and I quote, &#34; Mom that was AWESOME!&#34; If he only knew how little effort AWESOME actually took after reading a few chapters of The 4-HOUR CHEF. Tim, pick the next adventure and keep the great reads coming...
B003ASLJO0|5.0|I bought this for my daughter for her birthday. She has always wanted the movie. we have watched it so many times. LOVE Clint Eastwood!!
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|This show is really good. The idea is very well executed, without the sugar coating of many other vampire shows.  Not sure what else to say, just watch it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|If you read Fall of Giants you must read part two.  War, romance, betrayal and so much more keeps the reader on the edge.
B0083B3KOQ|5.0|Here was my experience with the player:<br /><br />I used it to convert 2 music albums. I put .wma VBR (Variable Bit Rate) files on to my Coby Kyros that I did a &quot;wipe factory data&quot; on (turn off the Kyros then turn it back on while holding power button and one of the volume buttons) the Android 4.0.3 Ice Cream Sandwich operating system that the Kyros came with. Be warned that if u do the factory wipe on the Kyros, your HDMI will no longer work (unless u can get a tech guy somewhere to show u how to fix it). I donwnloaded this App only to convert these 2 albums that were on my Android in .wma VBR format to a format that any player on the Android would play. I have high speed wireless internet, which is required to use this App. I converted both of my albums that were on my Android into mp3s using this App on the droid. No PC or anything else used. Files on Droid converted with App on Droid to folder on Droid. The converted files all played in the music library that came preinstalled on my Kyros. No problems. Only complaint is that I could not find any option to convert multiple files at once. Had to do one at a time. They took about 1.5 minutes per file...for about 3 to 6 minute songs in the 220 wma VBR range. Very pleased to be able to play these albums along with the rest and half no hassle or trouble whatsoever with this App. Didn't even freeze once unlike some Apps. Didn't use it to convert any other types of files so can't vouch for anything but the 220 wma VBR files succesfully converting to mp3
B004XVN1T4|5.0|Spionage, the cold war, russians, germans and the middle east are the main ingredients to this novel full of suspence, intrigue, and romance.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|It was amazing I could not put it  down I had to know  what happened next in the story or I would die
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very very fun and addicting game. Fun for all ages of horse lovers. Awesome graphics and seems very life like.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I haven't taken it out of my CD player all week and not sick of it yet! Good variety. Not one of those CD's with 75% slow songs - mostly upbeat!
B008BTOVL6|5.0|Exactly what I wanted, works great!!! I received my shipment way fast and am very pleased with my purchase. Thanks!!!
030758836X|3.0|Gone Girl<br /><br />This was an interesting book even though the subject matter was somewhat dark.  I hope I never meet anyone like the main character in real life.  If I had been her husband, I would have gotten away from that woman and found a new country to leive in.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a fun game.  Kinda continuous.  Nothing fast paced. Good for passing time ! Try it today because they are making me have a word minimum!  Still trying to get it to let me submit.  Best awesome thrilling can't live without game!!!
B003QS9SGA|3.0|Charming but a bit short on plot---good comedic scenes though kept things lively.  Would rent again some time in the future
B009KUANWG|5.0|Adele's range and velvety voice is nothing short of amazing! And then mixed with the traditional Bond music in this fabulous song... it's simple beyond words. I turn up my speakers and just listen to this song over and over! Wonderful purchase!
020530902X|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who needs a little help improving your writing. I am going to share this book with my two high schoolers. All ages can benefit from this book.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I absolutely love Dragon Story!!!! I never thought I'd play it so much, but I`m totally addicted!!! Buy this game! It's free and the greatest game on earth for FREE!!! You don't have to pay for anything in the game, the dragons are adorable and FREE!!! How could you not love this game?!? You don't have to do anything, the dragons can't die. You can buy dragons for coins, which you easily collect because the dragons produce coins. You can breed the dragons to find common or rare dragons, my most prized dragon is my Fairy Dragon, it would have cost me 400 gold, which I only have 20 gold, but I got it for free because I bred my Forest Dragon with my Air Dragon. You can also name your Dragons, my favourite is Tofu. You can feed your dragons to make them bigger, the dragon on the logo is the Fire Dragon(at level 4,5 or 6). Also, when you but dragons, you level up, which allows you to buy more dragons. There are 6 types of dragon, and many sub-types, Fire, Forest, Air, Water, Magic, and Crystal. The graphics are adorable, and I love playing just to look at the baby dragons. You can visit other peoples Dragon Isles and play with them to give them a bonus, and when people play with your dragons you get a bonus too. So, if you want an adorable, addictive, free game this is the one that you want!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|having this game not open properly and freeze every time I open it takes from the experience of a good game. I have had ti erase and re-download it 4 times already.....
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is like temple run 1  but they fixed<br />the control problems.  All in all this game is sweet
B001NLN07K|4.0|Not bad, moves along ok. Serious BigBoy toys. Sex, guns and drugs. Slick visuals, it'll do for a cop flick.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Free is easy to use.  Small ads on bottom.  Are not obtrusive at all.<br />Will continue to use the app.<br />  Thanks..
B009KS4XRO|5.0|The game was suggested to me by a co-worker who likes the game.  I tried the game and I also like it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|How do you get the update for Minecraft for the kindle. I have it for the kindle,computer and for the iPod,ipad
B0063IH60K|4.0|The game is awesome, but the ads can get to be a little much. Eventually I will get the paid version, but other than that it is just straight up solitude fun.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|This won't be a long detailed review.  I have her first album too.  This is an amazing leap over that previous effort.  I love this music.  I love her voice... I love all of the selections..  I pray that we will see Miss Rossum in more musical theatre in more musical films.  My recommendation may mean little - but it can't be stronger.  Pick it up, you won't be sorry.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Best series ever.  Beautiful setting, costumes, actors and content. Want to own every season.  Well worth the investment and time.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I saw this movie twice...I am SO glad the directors and producers decided to wait to make this movie in the present and not the past.  The cast is outstanding..especially Hugh Jackman, who is already an accomplished singer.  Anne Hathaway, Eddie Redmayne and Russell Crowe are also amazing.  The barricade ensemble are AMAZING!  There voices blend as one and give me chills.<br /><br />To have three actors in the film that have been on the London Stage of Les Miserables that is still playing, after 27 years. Cameron Macintosh made the best decision of his career to include these beautiful, talented actors.<br /><br />This musical depicts love and loss between three people. The music and story of this movie just pulls at your heart strings. I can see why Les Mis has lasted as long as it has on the London stage.<br /><br />I will watch this movie over and over again. This musical still gives me chills. I can't wait to see them at the Hippodrome in Baltimore in April. I heard a rumor, Les Miserables, may be coming back to Broadway early next year.
B00AIA89HS|5.0|Well, I don't know . . . but if you don't live for something, you'll die for nothing!!  My only justice lies in knowing they'll eat every F*&^ing word!!
0988262592|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this book.  The authors have drawn from their vast IT backgrounds to create a realistic practical depiction of how to improve things for IT.  (both Development and Operations).  This is critical as we more and more are told to do more with less along with a crushing velocity of product needs. The story leaves you on the edge of your seat wanting to know the next challenge that comes up and how &#34;Bill&#34; the IT manager will attack it. I have read a LOT of IT improvement books and this is by far the one that has inspired me the most.  I've already been promoting some of the ideas.  Of course what else what would you expect from this great trio who wrote &#34;The Visible OPS Handbook&#34;.  Thanks for continuing your quest to research high performing companies and sharing your insights with us out here driving improvements.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Very well written! Lots of information is given but all is relevant to the story. It seems like the author is very knowledgable on many subjects so there is a lot that binds the characters together. I love Diana and Matthew and am constantly rooting for them to get together! I hope they end up with a child! Can't wait to read the next book!
B00B0NDF26|2.0|Bought this one untried and unsampled.  As a long time fan of Tegan and Sara I knew I would like it so I bought it.  Wow, was I ever wrong!  This is not the Tegan and Sara of years past, this album is a dramatic departure away from alternative rock and into pop dance music.  Be forewarned, even if you are a big Tegan and Sara fan, you might want to sample these tunes before you decide to buy.
B007I1QUHG|1.0|The movies do not play in my xbox 360 console, which is my only source of a DVD player. i would appreciate a full refund considering i had to wait over 3 weeks just to get the DVDs that don't work.
B007SY3CEW|3.0|This is a good piano simulator, but you need to have a device that has true multi-touch (not just 2 touch input) for a number of the songs. Heavy on the classical, which I like, but I'd like to have more of other kinds of songs, too. After trying several piano apps, my two favorites are: 1) Magic Piano, which doesn't have much to do with piano playing (other than an optional free-play keyboard) but the main part of the app is a very easy way to &#34;play&#34; a number of songs (I recommend paying for the &#34;Smoola&#34; to buy some of your favorites, especially if you don't care for classical - classical is Public Domain, but modern popular songs are copyrighted and licensed). 2) Pianist HD (AKA Finger Tap Piano) which actually uses a simulated keyboard like Piano Master but also has a number of settings you can adjust, a recording option, a cloud sharing service, and my favorite (possible only with the Diamond paid-for version) the ability to import MIDI songs. But if you want a play-along app with a keyboard instead of magic dots and don't care for all the options that come with HD Pianist, this might fit your needs.
B00005A0B7|5.0|If you enjoy old school R&B that's heavy on the blue notes, you'll bound to like this album. It's mostly all good. Even the less then perfect fidelity can't be faulted because this is rare stuff indeed.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|This album is well worth the money. To be honest though, the first time you listen, you say to yourself \\"this is weird. Why did I buy this?\\" But then you keep listening. Somehow it goes from weird to \\"can't stop listening good\\". Highly recommend. Also, if you have some speakers or headphones that play the low-end frequencies, you will appreciate it on a whole new level.
0811870987|5.0|I bought this as a gift and we went through it together after he opened it, wow!  The pictures are really beautiful!  Great buy!
1608862801|5.0|If you watch the show this is a great addition to it. It is hilarious and just like any episode.
B0039Q7QKE|5.0|It is actual size and pins on nicely. I have found that it is not intended for easy display moreso for being worn. But I got creative. Plus the box it arrives in also acts as a display.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|This is a great movie during the times of the prohibition. It's cool to see the whole lifestyle of the people back then when they had to rely on making moonshine to survive!
B001XCWPAM|2.0|Foreign copy of these movies that does not play in all bluray players that makes these movies useless for some.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Great read. Very interesting storyline. Learned something and also enjoyed the characters. Highly recommend this book to fiction and nonfiction readers alike.
1936891026|5.0|While this book is a must read for the creative soul, everyone can benefit from the War of Art. If you've ever tried to loose weight or run a marathon or do your taxes or finish a project of any type and struggled to not only get started but finish, then Pressfield is talking to you. He labels the enemy that keeps us from being productive as \\"resistance\\" and reveals the tricks that \\"resistance\\" plays to keep us from accomplishing those items we've set out to do. You have to know the enemy to beat him and Pressfield shines the light brightly on this one.<br /><br />I've read this book several times in the past year and know that it will be one I refer to often in the future. Pressfield's work has had a huge impact on my life.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love love love this app!!!!!!!!! it is the beet app!! so easy and very realistic! !!!!! I love it!!!!
0307279189|5.0|Born to Run gave me the inspiration and courage I needed to toss my big, bulky running shoes with the custom arch supports in the trash can and hit the trails in zero drops. After years of knee and hip pain, I'm on my way to being able to call myself a runner again thanks to his book and the resources he shares.<br /><br />All this aside, it's just a damn good story telling. I read it the first time straight through only stopping when forced to by circumstances beyond my control. Then read it a second time a few weeks later out loud to my spouse on a long car trip. The characters, while real live people, are larger than life. That coupled with the way McDougall weaves the story together pulling from history, science, the lives of others, and his life is nothing short of masterful.<br /><br />This is good, good stuff.
B0029XFNA8|5.0|Excellent movie and had wanted it on blu- ray. The only thing is that I didn't realise that it is in black & white. Thought it was in color because of the packaging
030726999X|4.0|I enjoyed all three books. Understood they found another of his. They kept my interest. Plots were very good Characters were also well done.
B0001AP158|5.0|Entire album has different version of familiar songs. Absolutely wonderful. Like all new songs and they are grand! Well worth it in my opinion.
B0071DJZZA|3.0|Think these books were more for younger readers [teens etc] Don't think they should be compared to the Harry Potter<br />bookks
B005RYF5JA|5.0|I am such a Celtic Woman fan and had copied this from their television performance but could not keep it on my DVR indefinitely.  The DVD is much better as you don't have the promotional material included.
B009MF56GC|5.0|For a generation of those who grew up with these stars as our action heros, you could not ask for any better. Shoot em up scenes and one liners have you with a smile on your face by the end of the film.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|...and then I will read it again.  This book is wonderfully funny, warm, endearing.  It's about looking forward, back, in, and out.  Stephanie Perkins writes with grace and charm.<br />The story flows....I appreciated the correct use of grammar & punctuation.  I will read every Stephanie Perkins book....and fall in love over & over again!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Like daily reward every day to time to time to time to time to time to time to time to time to time to do it in your own company has also a new one that has a few years old man in a new study shows how much money to the role that you can also use a few days later on a few years back and watch them with their children are being the first place of a new comment on the role in the first to be the role that is the first time since I've got the role in the role in the first place in your I meant that has been in a new one is no longer have some fun to watch it on this game and the first time in your life is the role that you replied with a few weeks back in a great job on a ago.
B007THA4FI|1.0|It truly was a let down considering the Harry Potter Books!!  I just couldn't get into it :( Don't wast your money on this book.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and found it inspiring to go out there and make things happen. I read this book the same week that my mom passed away and could really connect with her feeling if loss and unfairness. She reminds us all to accept and embrace the challenges in our lives.
B003O86FMW|5.0|There's enough action in this tale to keep me on my elliptical beyond the time I had planned. I enjoy a book that reveals twists and turns that had not even been on my radar. I'm glad I still have a book to go in the series. Love the characters.
B00B7YQ44Y|5.0|My wife and I have watched this show from the beginning and it just gets better and better. All of the characters work so well together and their chemistry is great. Schmidt, Jess, Winston and Nick are an awesome foursome that makes us laugh for 20 minutes straight. Every episode is full of laughs in real situations; I feel like we could hang out with all of them and fit right in. The writing and the story lines are great, they haven't gotten worse but better each episode and the show is getting stronger. This is an awesome show and a must watch. I wish there were more writers that could bring us awesome shows like New Girl and less \\"reality\\" style shows.<br /><br />Good:<br /><br />Great characters<br />Good writing<br />Really funny<br />Keeps getting better<br /><br />Bad:<br /><br />Nothing as of yet!<br /><br />Overall 10/10
B005H29GSI|5.0|We already had the first set.  This adds to what my boys already have.  Now they can build bigger forts to topple over.
0425098478|5.0|This is a book that I always keep in my desk. It is a quick and easy read, good information, and also inspirational. It is one that should be read every six months if you are in a leadership role where you work.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I loved this book and read it fast! It's a great story about life bringing two people, well families, together who really need eachother more than they could have thought. I found myself laughing out loud, &#34;awwww&#34;ing,  and even tearing up. I was skeptical about reading number two, &#34;The Point of Retreat&#34;, but have found the perspective change to be refreshing. This author did a great job continuing the story and keeping me hooked.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Take all of your favorite and familiar story book characters, put them in a blender, spit them out in present day but flash back to their past (which never was because most of them never met).  Throw in mystery, suspense, and total craziness and you'll become addicted.  Warning Rumpelstilskin steals the show. ...And you must watch from the beginning to appreciate the story line.  It's so much fun, don't pass it by.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book!! Colleen Hoover did a wonderful job writing this story. Although fictional I found it to be inspirational. The story was a lot different than I had anticipated when I purchased it and I'm glad I honestly may not have read it if I wasn't already invested. Great read for any age,over 17.<br />  Sky herself is in high-school but handling mature situations that anyone could find interesting and hard to put down. The story takes enough twists and turns that I couldn't stop reading.<br />  Great job Colleen Hoover you have accidentally become one of my new favorite authors.
B009POCG5Y|5.0|I really like Clint as an actor and this movie didn't change my mind about him he is a great director and actor.  He hasn't had a bad movie yet in my opinion and I'm a baseball fan as well
0765325950|5.0|This book moves at a very fast pace. Found myself sitting at the edge of my seat waiting to see what happens next. This has been one of my favorite books of this series.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|IT kept my interest the whole time.I would recomend this book to anyone that likes a good romace story. Excellant
B003R0MF1W|5.0|love the series!  Love the plots and the action that Simon Baker tries to avoid.  Fun TV nights for my hubs and I
B003ODIZL6|5.0|The reason I rated it 5 stars is because its a dictionary, I found the word I was looking for and so I got my homework done. The part I didnt like about it was since its on a electronic device why isnt there a search bar to search the word your looking for? Instead of going through the whole thing. The part I like  was you can change the color of the pages, which helps me because a lot of white is too much, you can change the font size, the type of writing style, I personally think thats a good thing. I would recommend this book to everybody since it is a dictionary and everybody will need to use it more than once in their life time.
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|I so love sitting down to these and seeing how some of the worlds horrors are worked through.  Dont know that you want popcorn or treats with these shows!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This  game is fun because I don't have a real horse! I get to feed the game and play with it and compete!
B0087JTAKW|4.0|this is his second best in my opinion..just under Thursdays With Morrie .  I liked the book more and more as I kept reading and started understanding what was going on.  It was a little distracting at first, but as i said, it ended up a very thought provoking book that i will for sure read again.

B003LL3LHO|4.0|Got introduced to Guild Wars with Guild Wars 2 and used this book to get a bit more insight into the lore. Liked it
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book kept me interested from beginning to end, I would recommend to all my friends. Superb job always :)
B0053O89WY|5.0|I recommend this to all Big Bang Theory fans, along with seasons 1-4! Nothing special, just a DVD with BBT awesomeness!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|IT REALLY WORKS! I used to have so much trouble waking up in the morning. I tried all kinds of alarms, none of them ever really worked that we'll, being a heavy sleeper makes this challenge even harder. I finally stumbled across this app and I haven't slept in a day since. If you have the same issue I did, or you just need an alarm to pull you out of your dream land and back to reality then this is the app for you.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|We have seasons 1-5 and watch these DVDs over and over!  (eventhough they come on TV)  I recommend to all Big Bang Theory Fans!
B007PTJOV0|3.0|Don't get me wrong I love this app.(one up) but the thong about it is ......... it has sooooooooo many ads it is unreel.(the down)
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Really fun game.<br />Bought the full game and can't wait to see what happens next. I plan to check out more of the G5 games.
0440246008|5.0|I suppose almost every one who has read a Jack Reacher novel knows what to expect from this &#34;tough guy&#34; hero and they will not be disappointed when they read this story. He takes you &#34;down a different street&#34; from most crime writers. I really enjoyed this one!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Everything is complete and makes sense now. Should have just read the book to begin with, I could never understand why people were so crazed about the movies and even more so the books
1574216988|5.0|I so enjoyed Sandy's Tangles in this small book, a delightful bunch of goodies. If you are just beginning with Tangles, this is a lady who can really help show you the way. Her combinations are a delight and I give this book of Sandy's a well deserved 5 ***** rating. Thank you Sandy !! :-)) Kind regards, L.B.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|While I was not thrilled with the instruction sheet, I loved the way this item looks so I went ahead and installed it.<br /><br />Like others, I had no problems using this to hold a 27&#34; monitor.  My Viewsonic only weighs 12# so it is well within the manufacturers recommendation.<br /><br />It looks great!  Everyone who walks into my office comments on it...all positive.

B00B2V66VS|1.0|when i log on to temple run 2 it shuts off and goes back to the home page. Then you have to download it agian.
B005I6EU7U|4.0|I love it and have received many compliments. I just wish it folded into a stand the way the HD cover does
B004RL9T50|5.0|Really a fun fun  movie!!! Kids love it and so do the parents. Probably will buy it at some point.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Such a fun app no matter what age. It was definitely worth the money. I can't stop doodling in my free time
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it was a very good game. I don't care what you thought about it but I know I loved it
B009X01C64|5.0|I guess the title says it all, for the price and the benefits you get with this tablet is beyond expectation, Screen quality and many others things. Just do yourself a favor a review the differences between tablets before committing.<br />You will find the verdict.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|What a good way to end the trilogy. I believe this was the best of any Batman series. I think this is the Batman that Bob Cane had in mind when created this character. I think everybody should see this movie it was awesome.
0877180121|4.0|i boutgh it for my son, i want to teach him to play.<br />it looks very nice and very child friendly.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Usually a Johnny Depp movie is pretty good. I thought this was going to be corny but it end up being a real good movie with a good story line. I think that Tim Burton directing this movie is what made it  and a good performance by Johnny Depp. Would recommend this movie to any one.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is one of the best games I have ever played in my life.<br />It is better than minecraft pocket edition.
B00005M989|3.0|glad to have greatest hits but I am not a super big Prince fan just wanted to have the hits
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|At first I was not sure about this game. Then it grabbed me and I can't stop playing!!! It's a keeper!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My kid loves this game. She plays it so much that she forgets to do her homework. Even her friends enjoy it.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I'm SO excited to see an audiobook edition will be available in March!  And based on the audio sample, the narration sounds like it will be bang on.  This story will make such a great audiobook.<br /><br />It's hard to add to what's already been said in all the reviews so far.  The Martian has everything that makes a great story.  The protagonist is so easy to connect with that you feel you know him as soon as the book opens - that's incredibly hard to do.  The plot is so enticing, I was easily drawn in with a single-sentence synopsis (how often does that happen!?).<br /><br />It's just one of those stories that is so brilliantly written, it steps outside the boundaries of it's genre, and appeals to the masses.<br /><br />Should be made into a Hollywood blockbuster film some day!!  I will definitely be eagerly awaiting Andy Weir's next offering!
B002BWP49C|3.0|i had to have it to go with rest i do like the extras  it is a must have if you liked the otherd
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I didn't think this was something I would particularly enjoy for myself, but I love it- especially how customizable it is.
B004RKXN44|5.0|I just discovered this series not too long ago (thanks, Sister) and have been so excited to read my way up to this book. Good gravy, it did not disappoint.<br /><br />Love the expansion of the larger story arc.<br /><br />Love the development of the characters...Walker especially. Nikita...the Ghost...Kaleb...Anthony...WHAT WILL HAPPEN???? This was a pivotal book in the series, so if you haven't read the first 9 you should before you pick this one up.
B0019IB26I|5.0|Having just discovered John Mayer I took the chance that the live offering would be enjoyable. What I found was heavenly, just marvelous. John Mayer and the trio kicked my ass. I was so motivated that I have since purchased three more of this CDs, including the newest.......BORN AND RAISED&#62;
B009ERK1T0|5.0|This CD is very good.  The product was shipped very quickly and arrived by the date advertised.  Very satisfied customer.
B003S897UK|3.0|This effort by the MULE turned out to be worth the effort because the second disc introduced me to a Blues Man I was unfamiliar with..........one LITTLE MILTON. The three disc set was enjoyable, finding Little Milton was the treasure.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|This CD is very good.  The product was shipped very quickly and arrived by the date advertised.  Very satisfied customer
B001FOPODS|3.0|This was well done, but it seemed too short.  I thought there was more to this story.  I was a bit disappointed.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|A wonderful story about a special artist, and beyond that an artist who understood that making music is part of a seamless tapestry of living a well-lived life.  An inspiration.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I love this movie but even more I have to say how awesome Amazon Video is. I watched this the first week it came out on DVD and I didn't have to go out and try to get it. Watched it on my XBox. I &#60;3 you Amazon!!!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I don't know how many times I've bought an album where all of the songs except the single are awful. This is NOT the case. Every track is amazing no need to skip around. Buy it.
B007YQAYDG|5.0|I saw him on Conan and really enjoyed the song he played. I had to buy the album especially when I saw the good price on here. Great album and great artist. Great mellow music.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I really enjoyed the DVD. I love the series and the characters. DVD is in great shape and the case is designed very attractively.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|Great movie. Blu-Ray makes it better. Anyone who like Liam Neeson and edge-of-your-seat drama would like this movie very much.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I wasn't going to post a review because there are so many praising it, I thought why bother. But really--why not bother? I really, really enjoyed it...and that's saying something because the main character is in high school and it's written in present tense. Both of those are usually turnoffs, but this story hooked me right from the beginning. Great character development, great pacing, great twists/turns, though if you're paying attention, you can see them coming. I can see why someone would say it's depressing and relatable to female audiences only. Unfortunately, we ALL know girls who have been in situations like Sky's or we've been that girl (the stats say so). Even worse, we don't all end up with selfless mothers like Karen or understanding boyfriends like Holder. It's incredibly sappy at times, which would normally be a kiss of death for me too. Not here. Given the subject matter, I think it was handled just right. I also loved how everything tied together and connected in a realistic way, right down to the last page. In fact, the very end (pinky scene) really did me in. I'm happy to see this indie author doing so well, so quickly. *Amazing* Way to go, Colleen!
0679805273|5.0|This book is a great gift for people leaving a job, going off to college, or moving away in general for any reason!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This is a great movie I recommend this movie for everyone and it was so easy to stream this movie from Amazon..
B0095ZMMCK|2.0|Tom Clancy's mastery was in making fiction both creditable and utterly believable.<br /><br />The suspense was brought about by his characters' doing extraordinary things within the real limits of red-taped bureaucracy and human capabilities.<br /><br />And this is where his writers go wrong. Gone are the intricate plots and technical descriptions. Gone are the politically-relevant and (mostly) historically accurate backdrops surrounding a plot.<br /><br />Global super-large organized hacker crime rings? No thanks.<br /><br />Jack Jr, the son of the President, an analyst / gun-wielding secret agent? Meh.<br /><br />After proudly owning the hard cover of every Tom Clancy novel, I'm glad I purchased this digitally. There's a metaphor there, which makes it one more than can be found in this novel.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My daughter loves this app.  She was about 1.5 yrs old when we got this and she really likes it.  I'd say these puzzles are good for about 1.5-2.5yr olds.  There are plenty of puzzles that she doesn't get bored.  If you baby likes puzzles, this is really a good app.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Need to watch it with someone, it scares me half to death. Love it love it.  Brings back memories/stories of vampires, things under your bed, cartoons (haha) and all the other scary things in the night, plus angels, devils, what will the writers think of next..........
0783240236|4.0|Before there was Jurassic Park and Jaws, there was \\"The Birds.\\"  There are adversarial themes running throughout this film.  There are battles between the sexes, man versus nature, and one with oneself.  Seen are contentious dynamics between men and women, as well as between women.  Hitchcock plays this out with regards to dealing with the conventional restraints placed on men and women within society. This is exercised through the mannerisms, speech, and behavior directed towards each other.  His statement about male/female relationships is that they are combative, provocative, competitive, and sometimes comedic. Often times this can erupt into disharmony when it is exploited.  The dilemma lies in how to deal with things that are beyond our control.  In this film, the men do so by being patronizing, dismissive, and controlling towards women.  Traditionally, this is considered acceptable behavior.  But not for women like Annie and Melanie, the two young women who are love interests in Mitch's life. The first, being the former, whom is still in love with him.<br /> Mitch is attracted to unconventional women, such Annie and Melanie, who go against the grain of conventional society.  Annie is strong and independent, and Melanie is a high society woman, who has the freedom to do as she pleases.  In doing so, this causes friction with his mother, Lydia, who is uncomfortable with his desires to rebel against social norms, even though he was raised as such, and has a traditional profession.  This illustrates a desire for men to also want to exercise outside the boundaries of what is considered acceptable.<br /> Life is a game between chaos and perfect order.  If it is too rigid or chaotic, it will attempt to rebalance itself out.  Resistance occurs as a result.  The seagulls represent a symbol of preservation of nature (Mother Nature--female) against man, who has exploited the planet, causing destruction and chaos against them.  The question is how we deal with it.  Does civilization decide to mature through negotiation and cooperation (Maturation), or deal with it through competition (Darwinism)?  This is universally applicable not only to dealing with nature and society, but also with oneself.  It creates conflict and fear, because it goes into the realm of the unknown.<br /> One of my favorite moments in the film which illustrates the struggle one has with oneself deals with Mitch's mother, Lydia, when she first meets Melanie.  Once again, she has to contend with a person who is unlike her, and with whom she perceives as a threat to what is left of her former cocooned way of life. When Mitch introduces Melanie to her, as a friend, she gives Melanie a subtle long up-and-down stare to let her know right away to stave off any designs she may have towards her son.  I found it slightly comedic in the way she does this.<br /> Through the ordeal with the birds, they become the catalyst that creates a bond, in the end, between Melanie and Mitch, and Melanie with his mother, that would have not otherwise have happened.  It has forced all them to choose the path of maturity in order to survive the chaos and uncertainty in their lives, not only within Bodega Bay.ivilization decide to mature through negotiation and cooperation (Maturation), or deal with it through competition (Darwinism)?

B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is a great little game to play when you have some time.<br /><br />Its pretty basic, your character runs and you avoid objects, lest you die or get eaten by the monster. Collect coins, powerups, and other items to make yourself better and faster. Purchase other characters to change up the game play.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|It is really great.  I love her voice.  The music sounds great on my kindlefirer.  I would recomended it to my friends.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I wanted something on my Kindle Fire 1st Gen that would give me more information about the state of my battery, how much run time was left etc. This app does that and more.<br /><br />The calibration was annoying but seems to have been worth it. I couldn't use my Kindle for about 1.5 hours as it ran itself through a half hour of web surfing, video, and audio so that it could see approximately how much battery was used for each activity.The amount of time is gives for each activity based on the current battery charge seems to have fallen more in line with my observations.<br /><br />The app not only gives you that information but also gives you some charts of battery usage as well as other information and a nice large easily readable percentage display of how much battery is remaining. I believe this app has a paid version with some more reporting features and I may consider paying for it even if just to support the developers.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved it, but I payed for one show and I had already seen it....review should be alittle bit more detail, so I would know which episode I am watching...so I don't pay for something I get free on PBS.  thanks...I learn from my mistakes..
0525952926|5.0|I know there have been a lot of people out there who have said that they didn't like this series of Ken Follet's books as much as some of his past books but I disagree. I have loved this series as much as any of his other books I have read. The research and history is fantastic and where he made things up on his own he meticulously sticks to what might have or could have been without taking to many liberties with the fiction part of historical fiction.<br /><br />To me the characters seem alive and real. I felt like I was living the danger and excitement right along with them. When things were going bad I felt their pain, when they narrowly avoided disaster or death I cheered and when times were good I felt their joy.<br /><br />I recommend this series to anyone who likes his books or who enjoys great historical fiction.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I really havn't had a chance to read it yet on my kindal,  but it reads well. I hope to read it soon.
1932100660|3.0|I haven't finished the book yet.  It's very informative, but dry, so it's not a quick read.  It will certainly change how I eat though!
B004GHNIRK|1.0|I did not like this book at all. I would. Not suggest. Anyone read it. The writing of the author was strange, in my opinion.
B001OR0AEY|5.0|This movie was awesome, the musicians are all phenomenal & it was really cool to see a bit of history that I was currently unaware of.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|I think it could be better. I was looking for something more complex and complete with all variations. I guess I'll keep looking. Not bad for basics but not enough for more complicated math.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|We missed the first couple of season 3. So when we finished Season 1 and 2 we really were hooked on the story. We also really enjoy the British countryside and culture.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Don't go anywhere without it. It's my right hand app. You can find it all or just about all right here on this app. Deserves 5 star rating. Everyone should have and download this app. Don't know what I'd do without it.
B009VL2AD4|5.0|Considering this could very well be a \\"one-and-done\\" collaboration, it turned out extremely well.<br /><br />What you've got here is two musicians who happen to be good friends who happen to have gone through breakups around the same time...who happened to write an album about their experiences. It's a very atmospheric and emotionally telling ride. The songs lyrically dance around some very personal views that are quality enough to justify this collaboration. Musically, the songs sound very much like Adam's last solo release, \\"Minor Love,\\" complete with Velvet Underground-esque production and brilliant melodies. Another thing that needs to be mentioned is how well Binki and Adam's voices compliment each other.<br /><br />This is a coffee shop record, the kind of record you put on at a party attended by learned individuals. Stylistic, emotional, retro, and full of personality, this album surpassed my expectations. I don't know if I'd call it Adam Green's finest album, but it contains some of his best and most unique material to date.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN! KEEPS YOU BUSY BUSY BUSY! AND IT'S HILARIOUS TO... THOSE DARN PIGS AND THE SOUNDS THEY MAKE... OMG! DEFINITELY A WINNER IN MY BOOK AND MORE THAN A 5 STAR RATING SHOULD APPLY TO THIS. DON'T DOWNLOAD ANYTHING BEFORE DOWNLOADING THIS APP... THIS ONE IS A MUST MUST HAVE ON YOUR PHONE, COMPUTER, IPAD, IPOD WHATEVER WHEREVER. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT! THERE ISN'T ANYONE THAT I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS TO. BABIES WOULD LOVE IT! LOL... KIDDING... NO BUT SERIOUSLY THE SOUNDS THESE CREATURES MAKE... JUST SAYING...
B0099Y2YL6|1.0|I purchased this last December because of the &#34;good&#34; deal and promise date of 1/29.  I do not watch Downton Abbey but they have a huge following and with the following comes a huge aniticipation to watch the episodes.  Needless to say my wife and I were disappointed that you can get the same deal and pick up on the same item on 1/29 from our local best buy.  Instead we have to wait until Monday.  Amazon did not meet the expectation they advertised.
B005HSL626|4.0|Keeps you busy and it's cool but I like the original much better. Hope they come up with something better soon. This does get old and boring. If you have nothing better to do this is an app I would recommend in the meantime. Nothing to brag about.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|went to see movie with my sister,we both loved it found that man sitting next to me crying...great story and fine music
B0031Y9DCS|5.0|A great explanation of what went on in that horrible war and the after effects on those who served and their familrs
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the perfect zombie show. I've been a fan from the start. I'm glad I can purchase the entire season on Amazon video streaming!
B00AWA5H60|5.0|The club kept playing Titanium Feat Sia and Without You Feat Usher on a regular basis. Play Hard Feat Ne-Yo and Akon came up every now and then. Curiosity prompted me to check it out on Amazon.<br /><br />The ultimate edition is really one of the best electronic albums I've heard in years. The vibe is fun and disc one is expanded to 17 songs including She Wolf (Falling To Pieces) Feat Sia and Wild One 2 (Edit) David Guetta & Nicky Romero (Jack Back) Feat Sia.<br /><br />CD 1 aka vocal album is filled with unabashedly great party anthems mentioned above and is guaranteed to have you jumping on the dance floor.<br /><br />CD 2 dubbed the electronic album is slightly more experimental. Only the first track Every Chance We Get We Run David Guetta & Alesso Feat Tegan and Sara contains vocals. The rest is purely electronic. Stand outs include Sunshine and Lunar.<br /><br />Nowadays, albums are more like work-in-progress unlike the 80s where releases are often final versions. Nothing But The Beat went through three incarnations. The original, then 2.0 and now the ultimate with 29 tracks being the most comprehensive. Love that glossy red print! Worth the wait!
B003Y5H542|5.0|Cannot for the life of me understand people anymore and I don't care. The one star reviews for this are beyond inane. To be a tad pithy this has some of the best animation and detail in ANY animation film made. The characters are whacky, likeable, and downright entertaining from start to finish. I thought from some of these negs I was going dislike elements in this one. Not a chance. Loved it to death. If you enjoy almost 3D like animation, without a 3D TV, and like the western setting and buckets of zany characters there is absolutely no reason not to give this a try. I liked it more than any of Pixar's recent offerings and pretty much everything else as well from the last couple years. I haven't seen something since maybe UP that has had me hooked but this one is a quite different way. You will notice the homages to certain films on the way through but nothing distracting. Pure fun and entertainment here.
B0091REZMW|4.0|A game for anyone that likes a little silly lost and found.... I love clue so what's that tell yeah lol..... good luck! :-)
B0084IG7KC|4.0|kind of a sad book but could not put it down, saw it at the show and ordered the Blue ray, it was good but never as good as the book but they had what I pictured perfect
B008WOULPK|2.0|This memoir was merely alot of name dropping with very little depth.  The last two chapters were the most interesting and it was a struggle to get that far.  I kept hoping for it to get better.  I love fashion but didn't find this particularly enlightening.  However, her descriptions of the characters was very well done making you able to visualize the person.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A fabulous book; I could not put it down.  I loved The Hunger Games, but Catching Fire was even more exciting. I highly recommend reading it.
0385363141|5.0|Loved loved the triology... I am glad I read it, cant wait for E L James to come out with another exciting, passion book like this.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Introduced by reruns accidentally. I Never laugh out loud at TV shows - never say never.  I'm female & worked w/this kind of guy - believe me that's how they are.  No social skills & mesmerized by women & know that they want them & no clue how to go about it.  &#34;My&#34; guys hid in their offices - had to be forced into conversation.  Do come out of their shells in time w/effort.  Can be quite charming after they get over the terror.  I digress, Sheldon thinks he knows Everything til he finds he doesn't.  His mom is endearing w/him & he w/her.  Watching Leonord alternately fold & stand up to Sheldon - a story unto itself.  Howard, so small & all that slimy enthusiasm for women. Roj - so sweet til he gets vendictive.  Last, but most certainly not least, Penny attempts to help them deal w/life outside of work & protects them.  Interaction between her & the guys makes the show what it is...
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This had been on my wishlist since it first came out, but couldn't justify spending $279.00 for the DVDs.  Finally, on sale for $89.00...a steal for me..  The best series I've ever seen and I never tire of the episodes!!  Thanks for the price reduction!!
B007FEFLTO|1.0|I'm extremely disappointed with the book.  I expected a great read from a very good author. I'm now at 90% in my kindle and I'm just reading to finish it as fast as possible.
B001NLKT60|5.0|A bit slow starting, this book slowly but surely gathers momentum with every page. I call it a gripping thriller. Will Lisbeth make it? If so, how?  Read it and see.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Temple Run two is the exact same thing as temple run 1. Plus it has bad drawings and bad graphics Don't get this game if you already have temple run 1 other people might like it but they Don't know what they're talking about
B002NXOQF2|5.0|One of the best books I have read.  Enjoyed it very much.  Watership Down was recommended to be by a friend. I  take the author at her word, that she was only writing the book for reading pleasure,  and no relativity  to human nature, but, whether intended, or not, there were many  incidents of behavior of the rabbits that are common to human beings, at least to some (people) that I have known.
B0083Z614S|4.0|I very much enjoyed this. I could actually see the children change!<br />As always, better than the movie. Good read.
B004SH40BQ|4.0|Works well with my iPod Nano. The only problem was that I have to go through the pairing process each time I use it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I was ok I haven't read a better diary of a wimpy kid book all the others had less funny things in it
B007HACDLK|4.0|This was a great book that was true to Mitch Rapp except for the end, which seemed to be an after thought. I would still highly recommend it but you will find your self engrossed in the story with 20 pages left and Vince Flynn just tosses in a quick ending.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I saw the Swedish version when it first came out and although the actors all did a great job I was disappointed by what was left out of the story.  I read the book and for once a book lived up to the \\"..couldn't put it down..\\" \\"..on the edge of your seat..\\" hype that you see on the covers of so many books. With that said, although the Swedish adaptation was well done, you saw a more one dimensional Lisbeth than we read about in the book.<br /><br />Having just finished watching the American adaptation of the book, I was blown away.  I thought the story was told more fully which set the actors up for a better portrayal of their characters.<br /><br />I think all the actors  in both films were outstanding.  Noomi Rapace and Rooney Mara both were fantastic although they each brought something different to the character neither slighted her in the least and the same can be said for the other actors/characters as well.<br /><br />If you haven't read the book, I would recommend the American version. If you have, both the Swedish and American version were done well but I lean towards the American version which I was not expecting.
0307730697|5.0|I really like this book. I found it to be very inspirational. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for insight into the war and Navy Seals.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!! constantly updated!!!!!!! best game on kindel!!!!!!! worth the money!!!!!! blocks paintings and much much more.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's difficult but the cool thing is it's fun and addicting AND u can never win, so u just want to play it over and over again. Definitely five stars :D
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The cable worked perfectly, but what I was most impressed with is the customer service I received from Amazon.  When I contacted the customer service department to explain that the cable that originally came with my Kindle was falling apart, the customer  service rep quickly responded, saying that the cable would be replaced for free and sent me the instructions for ordering the cable and receiving credit for the postage as well.  I am glad to know there are still companies, like Amazon, that know what good customer service is and continue to strive to provide it.  I was already a loyal Amazon customer, but this just reinforces my belief in your company.  Thank you!<br /><br />Can you reach out to AT&T and show them what good customer service looks like...they seem not to know.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|very entertaining. it was like watch a 30 rock episode where liz lemon is reading the script directly to me.  my wife gets it next to read.
B000N2HCM4|5.0|A book I enjoyed immensely.  My grandsons will read this book.  Every fatherless boy of color should make this a &#34;must read:&#34;
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|I expected an alarm clock and got a clock. You have to upgrade to get the alarms, so why not charge immediately instead of saying it's a FREE app. It was sort of a lure or bait and switch. Now I am not sure I want to upgrade because I'm not sure I can trust what I might get.
B007SGM084|5.0|This may not be War and Peace, but I wasn't looking for that, was I? I loved the interplay of emotion between Ana and Christian throughout the series. As confused and messed up as they were, it was difficult to put the story aside. I wanted to see them change and grow and enjoy the steam along the way.  One of the best I have read in a long time! I just couldn't put it down!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book! So much I couldn't put it down. I was upset to find out the next book in the series doesn't come out until May. I am not sure I can wait that long.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Great way to get right to Amazon and start shopping. Always looking for a short cut and this one works.
B009FZFONO|5.0|THE BEST SERIES EVER.I HATE SERIES BUT THIS ONE ROCKS MY SOCKS OFF.I WATCHED THE FIRST ONE TO SATISFY A FRIEND.
B005LAII8K|3.0|I'm a big fan of time travel stories and movies (and probably saw all of them!).<br />\\"Looper\\" has a few interesting original aspects: what happens to your older self when someone affects the younger version (well done in the movie), for instance, levitation...<br /><br />The first half of the movie sets the context and environment. Even people having no clue about what time travel can be should figure out pretty clearly what's happening, what a \\"looper\\" is, why are they \\"looping\\", what is \\"closing a loop\\" etc... Also, we learn that people in the future (2044) evolved and developed a sense of levitation.<br /><br />I liked the first half. In the second half, without revealing too much of the plot, there are a few overlong passages where the writers couldn't get the best from the original ideas developed in the 1st part.<br /><br />All in all, this is a watchable movie.<br />If it is your first time-travel movie, you will probably enjoy it more than me.<br />Otherwise you may end up a bit disappointed.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I love this series and have had showings to others who have missed this wonderful story in that time era.
B004QOB8SY|4.0|Sherlock II is a great show overall, especially the first episode. That \\"wow!\\" episode is well thought through, having (good and) unexpected twists.<br /><br />The second episode - that I saw immediately after the 1st one - was disappointing in comparison. Nothing really new, not really credible and - without revealing too much details - the ending is close to loughable.<br /><br />The 3rd and last episode is better. We see our hero facing what affects him the most... And a surprising ending.<br /><br />Some extras to hear and see our favorite characters from a real-life point of view. Interesting.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|I bought this in a package as a gift...it was appreciated, the package arrived timely and many thanks, thanks, thanks.
1119962846|4.0|Neede an intro to r before jumping into serious books. This is a nice unthreatening intro that was helpful to me and the students who work in my lab. Good start..
B008476HBM|5.0|I absolutely loved this old classic.  If you haven't read it yet, you should, after I got used to the older English way of speaking it just flowed beautifully.  A must read!
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|A great package with Two disks, one Blu Ray and the other DVD and the rights to download a digital copy besides.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|aNot as challenging as I thought, but have not used it much at this point, I love mahjong and have played other games.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|This case is perfect.  it fits well.  it was easy to insert the device in the holder.  It's all I need.
B004S9AK9U|4.0|One of those books which had to be read to the end to see if the main character received 'justice'.  Very descriptive and intriguing.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Walking Dead is a great TV show. I have seen every episode but the dvd is well worth a purchase.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Spooky and erotic! I was hooked on this show<br />right off the bat!<br />Some things are wierd and hard to follow, but that<br />seems to be part of it's charm.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The beginning of the book was pretty lackluster and reminded me a lot of 50 Shades of Grey, but I stuck with it, and it got so much better. It was captivating, intense, and, at times, heartbreaking. I would recommend giving it a read.
B004SMDJ9U|4.0|Good TV here, and the acting is surpringly well done.<br />Like all series shows, some of the episodes are kinda<br />soggy and hard to follow. There's a decent plotline developement<br />for later shows and the following series.<br />It gets better as it goes along. What really impresses me<br />about this is the filming of the town and cinimatography puts<br />you in that spooky, singular northen town. It's almost as good<br />as Sanctuary - but without the sci fi backdrops. It's very down to<br />earth with a X-Files wierd twist here and there. Highly Adictive.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Awesome game one of my favorites  I give it ten million stars has different type of place from temple run1
B005LAJ16I|5.0|starts off slow but, wow, the plot twists<br />really hook you into the story.<br />A masterpiece of plot developement<br />and the acting is beyond superior!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|EXCELLENT book  I can!t wait for the next book to come. How honey Christian and Anastasia are. E L JAMES some words are to hard too express.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|After watching Downton Abbey on Netflix, I decided to try Amazon Prime / Instant videos for the third season. I am very disappointed with the poor quality of the video feed as it continues to stop and fast-forward multiple times. It required me to completely stop the video and reboot my system. In addition, I find the entire Amazon Instant video service and software poor and clearly Netflix is superior.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|EXCELLENT  EXCELLENT book. I can!t wait for the next book to come out. I have already recommended this book to my friends
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. I had a very hard time putting it down.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl is one of those books that makes you jump up and down while shouting, \\"what just happened!\\" And it never slows down.<br /><br />The story is fast paced, engrossing, and filled with an unbelievable amount of plot twists. I've recommend this book to more people than any other. If you enjoy suspenseful, psychological thriller mysteries, then Gone Girl is a must.
B00280LYIC|5.0|this was a great book and I just read it for the first time so it was amazing and I do recommend it
B001NLKT60|3.0|If you're looking for a decent series, this works. It's entertaining, characters are interesting and once I started the series, I had to commit. This was probably the best book of the three. It kept me solidly amused during my commute but it wasn't anything that had me dying to get on the train so I could go back to my book.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This isn't as food as as the first one, but it's okay. The animation is great, but it's harder to control. I also found it harder to control the character. But like I said, it's okay. -LUCKY STAR ANIME!!
B007THA4FI|5.0|A Casual Vacancy has been grossly under rated. J. K. Rowling did a great job with Harry Potter but it was, at the end of the day, a children's series. A Casual Vacancy, on the other hand, is no doubt one of the most incredible adult literature books I've read. The reading level is high. There are many, complex characters and a rich, deep plot that brings you right in. Like Harry Potter, the book is long. And like Harry Potter, I finished the book within just a few days. It was impossible to put down and I spent more time thinking about the book, and wishing to dissect it with someone, than any other book in recent memory.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a GREAT game!! Full of strategy and quiz like features. Loads of fun for everyone! Oh, just realized I rhymed. Lol! Love it!! ~LUCKY STAR ANIME
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My granddaughter put this on my kindle at Christmas.  Been playing ever since.  It is addicting.  Keeps you on your toes.
B00005IBB3|3.0|I did not know that so many companies in this country were selling dvd's from Europe. Lesson learned! Fortunately someone had a player for European dvd's and we were able to play it, but, unfortunately we can't add it to our collection because most patrons do not have that kind of player. :-(
B0086700CM|3.0|Have played this a few times.  Have to have quick reaction and quick witted.  I am getting too old for this.  Will keep it for the grandchildren tho.
B007BVT5N4|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone....I really like this book because he put his heart into it although I cried a few times it's one of the best books I've read
B0063IH60K|2.0|Granddaughters also put this one on the kindle for Grandpa.  He loves to play solitaIire, they figure it is better than him watching ESPN.
0553584537|2.0|A week before reading this book, I finished reading The Survivors Club.<br /><br />As I listened to this book, I was instantly struck by commonalities between both books. 1. Convicted pedophile gets out of jail and is hellbent on exacting revenge on the one victim he let live. 2. There's a behind-the-scenes person who is paying for the carnage that follows. 3. The beautiful \\"victim\\" and the dutiful cop who thinks she's beautiful. 4. The dutiful cop goes rogue in the process of helping the damsel in distress.<br /><br />Maybe if I'd read these books years apart, I might have enjoyed both books. As it happens, I mildly enjoyed the Survivors Club and was bored by this one.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I downloaded the app on Saturday, on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday the app doesn't even work. It only worked on Saturday. Why must this app do these things to me?
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is a what science fiction should be. Good writing.  Good Science.  Good Story.  Once Man is left On Mars. He overcomes incredible difficulties to survive, using his knowledge of botany, engineering, and general common 'science' sense.  A great read.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Absolutely amazing. I could not stop reading until the very end and I will be buying all of the rest.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I recommend getting this game, great horses and tack. Get this game.e. Amazing game, didn't want to put it down.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Although the story is fictional, the information provided is on target in every respect. The only departure from reality, as Genova admits, is that the term of the disease has been shortened to about three years whereas most Alzheimer's terms are considerably longer. The book provided me with some insights not previously known to me and clearified others. I thank Lisa Genova for the mountain of research she put into Still Alice and will read her next book, &#34;Left Neglected&#34;. She is an excellent writer.
1452110581|5.0|I love this book, and bought a handful to give to all of my cat-obsessed friends (it's a pretty large group!).  I just open it to any random poem and laugh at how accurately the author captured the mind of a cat.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Works really fine on my kindle fire hd. Don`t know if params are accurate. I Like the look and feel and the graphics
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I picked this up expecting the usual Nicholas Sparks fare: meeting, sparks, conflict, happily ever after. This book has those elements, but they are much darker and more interesting than previous works by this author that I have read. I was pleasantly surprised, and I couldn't put it down!
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|Fun for the whole family.  This will become an annual event ro our family each Christmas and during the holidays!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My son says this game  is so great because he gets some of the levels on different days to play.
B009B4ZEKM|4.0|I love her new album and most of the songs.  She has a range to her voice that few can match!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this is a fantastic app! the fact that its free is nice to. better graphics, better gameplay, and way better scenery!
B004ZGI2KK|5.0|This movie was great. The animation was excellent and the action sequences were outstanding. This is definitely my kind of show. If you are into movies like &#34;Van Helsing&#34;, Underworld, etc. Then you will like this movie for sure.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it sooo much.  It has so much more detail and color.If I love it you will love it.<br /><br />  GET IT NOW!
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|This is a terrible charger.  It gave me a lot of grief from the get go about charging my Kindle - it wouldn't work immediately, would take about an hour before it even started charging.  Then it quit altogether about a 2 months later.  I do not recommend this at all!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is very amazing. help time go by had this one on phone but didnt work well. now on my fire its awsome.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I think most of the people who hate this haven't seen the 1st two Alien movies (don't ever watch 3 or 4.....UGH!).  By itself, this is a great film, but seeing how much of it ties into the original stories is how it can truly be appreciated:<br /><br /> -- (2 TINY SPOILERS) -- Explaining the positioning of the ship on the surface, and how Noomi Rapace's (Dr. Shaw) final speech is so close to Ripley's at the end of Alien are great.<br /><br />My 2 complaints (SPOILERS):<br />-- The way they discovered LV-426 felt very \\"Indiana Jonesish\\" (finding the arifacts on Earth with the same designs, basically a map).<br />-- The origin of the alien at the end had a \\"To Be Continued\\" feel - kind of like a 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' cliffhanger season finale.<br /><br />The sequel is in production now, with a 2014/2015 release.  I can only guess it will be much more of its own story, and less of a prequel to Alien.
B00846REIS|5.0|Blew 50 out of the waters highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed reading 50 Gideon was way hotter than Christian
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved the book. The end disappointed me...I wanted to see Amy get caught. It was a great story...but no real resolution.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great games. my girls love them and have a competition to see who can earn more points on each game. can't wait for more games
B0044KJIIC|5.0|imagination----a key ingredient-----there should be a&#34;Smallville Movie Presentation&#34;of where, when and how some of the loose ends are tied up! The WB really needs to answer questions like 'what happened to Chloe, the Justice league, the Kriptonians and perhaps two more seasons!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is really awesome.I really like that I didn't have to wait and I got it when it came out on the ipod or iphone
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Leonard Cohen is a favorite song writer and singer of mine.  I am listening to this new one over and over.  It's really wonderful.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I watched my friend play it and it looked soooooo soooooo fun so I got it!!! GET THIS APP NOW!
B005SAJJHM|5.0|The big bang theory, is a comedy, that everyone will love. the show always comes in clear and Amazon makes it easy accessible.
B0055PGUYU|3.0|This book is very strong on how people have good and bad habits.  Itr provides a good structure for educators and trainers. The last half of the book rambles, but still has useful information.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Cant wait for the other half of the season. What happen merle and darrel is so intriguing. I've never been into zombie movies but this show was very well thought out. Watch it
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I like to try to predict what is about to happen in a movie or how a movie will end. This movie was a challenge in that regard; which means it wasn't very predictable and in my opinion, that makes the movie a very good one.  It had a good beginning and an even better ending!
B003O86FMW|5.0|It took me a bit to really get into this one, but once I did...I couldn't put it down!!! I can't wait to start book 3!!!
B009AVCAJ4|5.0|One of the best, if not THE best. You read the other reviews. Just get it already. The price is right.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I loved the fact that my daughter was able to open it Christmas morning.  It came in the mail before it was on the shelves in the stores!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|overall interesting game. very different from I expected. I wish however that I didn't have to have gems to buy so much of the stuff in the game.
0670023329|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone,  it is an amazing story and the brave man who was the only one able to escape from this camp.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show gets better and better.  I sometimes cannot believe it. I need nine more words and dont know what to put.
B0007LXPBI|5.0|Such a great classic, fun to watch with each other.  Time less humor and family entertainment that goes well with even modern humor.
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|one of the best shows ever :) great great great great great great great great great great great great great ...
B004FP1WX0|2.0|it is what it is. not bad but not great. but now i know what facebook is and how to avoid being played
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|My husband and I play this game almost everyday. I feel that it's a good excerise for memory. It's a fun game.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I hats lots of trouple even with meds. So heard Dr. Oz talking about so had to check it out. Love it. And has ways to set timers and alarms...perfert
B00AYDC5HY|2.0|Not clear what this movies is doing, other than mimicking the horror movies of the Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff and Vincent Price era. Those movies had a much clearer purpose, even if it was biting people and sucking their blood to turn them into vampires. At least it was well defined. This movie, inexplicably in black and white (other than to mimic yada yada...), lacks any central idea or theme. The ideas it does present are lame at best, misguided and even reprehensible at worst. Dog lovers may like it, but everyone else should save their money.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|I stopped listening to LP after the dismal &#34;Minutes to Midnight.  It had a couple of good songs, but it just wasn't enough.  After seeing these guys live on tv performing tracks from this album, I was blown away!  I really hope they don't ever stop evolving and making music.  This one brought me right back.  Huge fan of this album!
B003KRJNBW|4.0|A good addition to any post-apocalypse movie collection.  The movie features action scenes spread out between sections of character and environment development.  Denzel is tasked with a divinely appointed mission from the God of Israel.  This movie is rated R due to scenes of violence, blood, sexual implications, and some language.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|This is one of those albums that you will remember buying, because it will have been the first time you heard this exact &#34;sound&#34;.  Like the first rock album, or the first taste of really good country you listen to.  Intensely unique.  I am a fan of Irish music, and also a fan of bluegrass, so this combined those elements in a wonderful way.  It is so mellow that I always forget that the one song has some f-bombs in it when I am playing it around my little ones.  Don't let that dissuade you though, it makes sense in the song.  This one is a haunter, it is gonna stick with you for awhile, it may even bring some tears.
B004TI5N38|5.0|it was a great book  to read held my attention through out  etc., etc.,etc., etc.,etc., wtc., etc., etc., etc.,thats it
B00A12VW86|4.0|Not a bad album, full of catchy songs.  I really think I will wait to buy anymore Greenday albums until they come out with more rock opera stuff.  The problem is that you see how amazing they can be, it's hard to settle for &#34;good&#34;.  That sounds silly, but it's just my opinion.  I don't think I will be purchasing Tre.
B008WCP2PG|2.0|Was I the only one that was hoping this would be hilarious? I mean my expectations weren't that high as far as plot goes (movie about male strippers right?) but they were high as far as what I want out of a romantic comedy. Boy, was I disappointed. I don't know how a movie that had a near constant half-naked Channing Tatum could go that wrong but I wanted to turn this dark untoned movie off about halfway through. But, if you're curious like I was and need to see it for the sake of seeing it, go to Redbox or something, don't pay full for this movie.
0345803507|5.0|This vendor had good prices; that's why I chose them.  The item arrived before the estimated date and in good shape.
B00003CXDB|5.0|Wall Street is a very good and at times great movie full of great actors good one liners and has one of best one liner's in movie history the \\"Greed is Good\\" line.  I have watched it mutiple times over the years and have yet to grow tired of it after all this time.  It is one of the director's (Stone) best works at that current time frame in movie history. Basics about the movie is guy wants to try to get into the high life and learn from the master of the high life played by Douglas and the other guy by Sheen.  But once in he gets more then he bargin for and wants a way out because like I feel whats the root of all evil Money.  But like the character it's fun in the beggining but wares off very fast and overtime.  Still one of my favorite drama's in my collection of movies.  So if you like Michael Douglas, Charlie Sheen, Martin Sheen, and that guy from the show Scrubs who does all the rants then pick this movie up and enjoy a good drama showing you how money can gulp you down whole.
B00AYB0SX4|3.0|Had high hopes for this movie but we found it very boring. Acting was decent for what they had to work with.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is even better than the first game in every way. And its even free and better than most games you pay for. In short get it.
B0099Y2MYK|1.0|If it follows the many twists and turns of the first two seasons, how can it miss?  I am anticipating its arrival.
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|The whole time I was reading this I kept thinking of that song \\"Put One Foot In Front Of The Other\\" from the cartoon Santa Claus is Coming To Town. It is slow, so if you like fast books, this may not be for you. I still found it to be a nice, entertaining read about a man on a long journey to say goodbye to an old friend.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|What a continuance!  The characters are very familiar, I like some and dislike others, just as the author wants....the acting is superb!
0553801473|5.0|I like how he keeps you guessing about what's going to happen and that no character is truly safe. I recommend this series of books to anyone.
B005I0DV4Y|4.0|I'm a guy and not a young one. Have been a film addict all my life.<br />Raised by my Grandmother (who could have run IBM but of course<br />had the horrible genetic disease of being a woman) I have fought<br />for equality (not sameness) all my business life, and was quite successful.<br />Watch this then show it to all the teenagers you can.<br />Bought it for Xmas for my 11 year old Grandson. (But watched it again<br />before I gave it to him.)
034552554X|5.0|I borrowed this book from my wife when I finished mine on vacation, and was surprised how much I really enjoyed it. Since most of the reviews seem to be from women, thought I'd add my 2 cents as well. Men--don't be turned off by the title. It's an engaging story, and pretty interesting to to learn there may be a deeper meaning to all those flowers you buy for the women in your life.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|Every Halo fan should read this book. It gives a great back story for people who want to know more about the game.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|While I was reading this book, I was going through some rough times, & I must say this book made me see things clearer. I loved it, it was definitely worth reading.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is very fun would be used by horse lovers. Would buy this game again. Plus its free very good!
B00AXVH8KQ|5.0|Every blue moon I read a Pitchfork review that I really want to listen to. This is one of those. I'm not one of those people that needs to listen to something 3 or 4 times to like it. First time was enough for me. Highly recommend.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Awesome!!!! I absolutely love this game! Ut oh? I need to get back to work! LOL!!! I PLAY THIS GAME EVERY OPPORTUNITY I GET.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Surprisingly it is fun! It runs smoothly on the Kindle fire hd..<br />I was a bit doubtful. But the details and the resolution of this game proved me wrong. Must download it, if you enjoyed the first Temple Run.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I had no problems with the movie it didn't skip it came right on time witched i loved And it has met all of my recruitments
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|i loved it and couldn't put this book down. Definitely recommend to read!! Can't wait for walking disaster to be launched! !!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was an amazing book! I was touched deeply by the special moments. I always picture the excitement and rush of the games. I can't wait to start the next book!<br /><br />To the greatest writer of them all!
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I love this show but didn't get the channel.  Great product. Rcvd it before they said I would. I would use them again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Needs the update that's available for my iPod &amp; I really want it but it's a great game still and I love it so much
B005LAIHGI|5.0|Really nice movie! Great acting! Gave to my friends so they would watch and enjoy it too! Would gladly recommend it
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really like this app. The graphics and everything you can do are really great. Caring for my own horse is fun, and definitively doing competitions.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|I used Amazon Mobile to buy 2 Samsung Galaxy S III's.  The process was easy; the price was great.  My order arrived promptly and I experienced no issues.  I would recommend Amazon Mobile.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Once you get into this book it wraps you in I couldn't stop reading it and once I got to the end I was so glad I could by the second one online!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game so much. its so fun you should really play it if you really really love hourses its a lot of fun
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love how it has the romance but also suspense and twists that you don't expect it's a combination of my two favorite things. One of my favorite books!

1451695195|3.0|Both my wife, my mother and myself read this book and found it both informative and disturbing.<br /><br />It has been said in other customer reviews of this book that \\"Fundamentalism, whether it be religious or scientific, is really no different than intellectual bigotry...\\" however, I would assert that if that same said fundamentalism is securely based on truth, then it is not bigotry.<br /><br />To allege bigotry in any conversation is to silence diversity of views; like loosely alleging the terms 'racist' when discussing matters of social policy.<br /><br />In that context, we found Dr Alexander's book informative, in the context of his scientific approach to his NDE, enlightening as it pertains to his personal experiences; but on many levels found his report of the other side in stark contrast to common-sense morality and revealed Biblical truths.<br /><br />As a 'fundamental' basis of God's revelation of Himself to man in the context of our 4 linear dimensions, God has made plain man's fallen nature; yet the very first communication Dr Alexander received was the assertion that he could do nothing wrong. The vast majority of recorded [scriptural] encounters with the Almighty reflect a different experience; that is, where prophet and saint were instantly and woefully convicted of a moral failing, when faced with the moral purity of the Great Uncreated.<br /><br />We do not doubt that veracity and 'reality' of Dr Alexander's reflections, but since there is no equivalence to a Consumer Protection mechanism on the other-side, [his experiences taken in total], we very much doubt the truthfulness of what he saw and was told by the entities he encountered.<br /><br />There are spiritual reasons why we humans living in the linear 4 dimensions are protected from the influences of the other side; and Dr. Alexander's report is not simply a validation of an existence of another side, but a reinforcement of a warning that 'all is not well' in a multi-dimensional universe where lies coexist with truth. And the ramifications of such plurality can have consequences on this side of the life-line...<br /><br />From a Christian argumentative perspective, one assertion that Satan could make as to the constructs of truth or lies, is that the ultimate arbiter of such values is God Himself, and that would infer that the 'game is rigged'. And thus if we follow this reasoning, we could conclude as sovereign individuals that we can 'do no wrong' since true free agency should also free us from any form of judgment. As Christians, we must condemn this notion, not only for its sophistry of construct, but for its kinetic effect of perpetuating evil.<br /><br />For example, if the medical and scientific communities were to [ as much as they are able] quantify, verify, and accept Dr. Alexander's representations of life on the other side as truthful, then there are no repercussions in the next life for any conduct in this life that we would consider 'crimes' [murder, rape, robbery, etc]. Indeed, all would be sweetness, joy, and light.<br /><br />To go further, if the medical and political community accepted these representations as doctrine, they would put a very positive spin on euthanasia, the murder of the unborn, and justify any number of behaviors that advantage the living, while comfortably putting to death those who stand in the way of that advantage. In this application of values, we find Dr. Alexander's book societally dangerous.<br /><br />We do recommend that people read this book, but only with an 'open mind'-- in the sense that all the 'moral truths' that has been revealed to Dr Alexander are in reality untrue.ere lies coexist with truth.

B005CMSDKA|5.0|This is easily one of my favorite films from the last five years. It is surreal in its imagery and sounds. So many interesting characters and wonderful performances. Mind you, this is not Matt Damon Bourne Conspiracy nonsense, this story wishes to be different and that will alienate morons (which I consider anybody that gave this movie less than three stars). This is a modern day fairy tale in the guise of an action film.
0374214913|5.0|This book is a treasure.  From the history of typography to what goes on inside Google's campus, it has it all.  The story is charming and the Bay Area scenes ring true.  I am giving away copies to friends.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really enjoyed the first game and this one improves on it in every way!  Multiple environments, much improved graphics, smoother framerate, everything.  Home run.<br /><br />Minor issue on Kindle Fire: back button doesn't work.
B000002UWF|5.0|Nice compilation of Louis Prima's hits over 25 songs. Great audio reproduction sounds terrific. Songs are as good today as they were back then!
B007HACDLK|5.0|The book stays true to the character, but brings in new angles and characters that are plentiful, but not confusingly so!
B008NEMPTO|5.0|Excellent 3D content.<br />Enjoyed it at home on a LG 55&#34; 3D smart TV + LG 3D Blu ray player + Onkyo Home theater system. Amazing effects!
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game is great, and it is getting close to the computer version, but an update was released today and at the time of posting, kindle didn't have the update :p oh well... comes soon!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Excellent 3D content. Movie is great to begin with!<br />Enjoyed it at home on a LG 55&#34; 3D smart TV + LG 3D Blu ray player + Onkyo Home theater system.<br />Amazing 3D experience and theater like sound effects at HOME!

B003JTHXOK|5.0|It took me a few chapters to get into it but once I did it just kept getting better and better!
B0086700CM|4.0|I'm not much of a game player but it's fun and my granddaughters love it. they were skilled from the start, but not so with me. I kept running into the tree.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Good games but would like to see word games. Why not games for adults?<br />Word games would be even more stimulating.
B00136Q1I0|5.0|some of his old hits I used to play. they still sound good to me. recommend to anyone who enjoys good music.
B005FVNJTS|5.0|A peek into the life and mind of a great champion who is Rafael Nadal . A book that will surley be appreciated by all lovers of tennis and not only . Worth to read , to understand that only through sacrifices and achieving their physical and mental limits of the great champions , get and keep up there.
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|It was good. It was one of the best books I ever read. It was funny when a senior waved at Greg
B00004Y6O7|5.0|I love this album, even more than VH I and 1984. I understand that it might turn off other VH fans because it's darker tone, but that's cool. All music reviews are subjective and we all listen to music for different reasons.<br /><br />To me, this is an amazing album. This is Van Halen's last \\"guitar\\" album before succumbing to Eddie's boredom-driven keyboard work in DD and 1984. His guitar work is at his peak here and there's also a lot more interesting bass work than in other albums.<br /><br />Finally, Roth's vocals on this album finally match the swagger and strut of his real personality. It's authentic Roth and the primary reason that he was one of rock's greatest frontmen despite his limited vocal range.<br /><br />Fair Warning is definitely Van Halen's least mainstream-friendly work, and this is reflected in sales. BFD. The day that a band starts crafting music to appeal to their audience (as opposed to simply making music they like) is generally the day they start sucking.
0812417755|1.0|I've yet to read the novel, but had to return THIS edition.  It's a Dell mass market paperback glued into a hard cover.  If that's all you need, that's fine, but I'd never seen anything quite like it.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|it was a lot easier then righting it out or having to go find a real calculator and it works great
1451688091|5.0|This book cries out for uninterrupted, prolonged reading and study.  Such detail and extended research seemed to have gone into the writing.  The more I read, the more I see similarities between Lincoln's style and our current Commander in Chief, Barack Obama.  I admit I have a long way to go to finish it, but it is a bedside staple and I am getting there.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love it! The game is very realistic and live like. I love wasting some time on it because it's so fun!
B008O5NINY|5.0|Back a century ago, he can write something like this, and still very influential to all readers. Very precise, and step-by-step, easy to understand piece of work.<br /><br />Few can understand the subject like he did. Among the best on shelf.
B001IC0AP4|5.0|While reading the first few pages, I found myself having to re-read them to understand; but then I realized I was looking through the eyes the the autistic child.  After completing it, I've recommended it to other parents/guardians of autisic children and have given my copies away to others in support networks.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|I tried this case with my Kindle Fire 7-Inch HD and it fits perfectly in a secure fashion. It is sturdy on the outside and soft on the inside. This folio case has four inside corners that holds the kindle fire securely and does not obstruct the screen or access to keys and ports. The cons of this case are that the cover can not be used as a stand for up-right reading, and it lacks a strap to keep the devise secure when closed. The design enables to slip it in and out of any bag with ease. It is great for travelling and I recommend this product.<br /><br />1. [[ASIN:B008HK3XU4 Marware Vibe Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 7\\", Purple (will only fit Kindle Fire HD 7\\")]]<br />2.

1419705849|5.0|My  Grandson is collecting the &#34;Diary of a Wimpy Kids&#34; series.  Good, clean reading for his age.  Will purchase more in the series as they are issued.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great book especially if you have any interest in the Kennedy assassination.  The side story going on keeps you hooked in and sympathetic to the main character.  Great Stephen King writing.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|best running game yet I like it a lot and play all day every day even Schenectady I sleep I dream of being chased by the bear
0446580848|1.0|I have read everyone of this man's books but this one sorely disappointed me. The plot was so overworked and there was so much unnecessary dialogue that I made it to page 300 and skimmed the rest, even the end was predictable.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I enjoyed this book the way I have enjoyed all of his books. This one wasn't one of his best. Still enjoyable reading.
0865479410|3.0|When journalists write psych books, they<br />have good research, good references, and<br />start out with a good premise.<br />Then they get lost and are unable to get to<br />the point of the issue. Lack of understanding.
B007H7XJD4|1.0|Too dark on the visuals, plot holes, uninteresting characters and most of all . . The Titans!<br />If anyone has read anything about or seen movies that involved Mythology or even played God of War ( 1, 2 or 3 ) that had loose but considerably more accurate accounts of what Titans were. .  This was clearly some attempt to pass off some . . Well I have to be nice here.  To say that some of the battle scenes were ok is one thing but, the story as a whole just left me not really caring how this ended.  Clash of the Titans (Original) circa 1981- Medusa, Release the Kraken!  Again . . These original movies I may have to keep making reference to may be low tech as far as CG 2013 filmation goes but when movies like this drop the ball like this I have no choice.  It may be just me but I think Titans were more creature based and sometimes Giants . . Not Dirty Soldiers with bad skin rashes that looked like they were in need of soap an water.  Sad .. Just Sad.<br />View if you’re easily entertained because I was really disappointed.
0385335997|5.0|Now I can read on & Amazon got it to me just in time.. :) I'll definitely be purchasing the next book a few chapters before I finish this one so I won't have to wait to see what happens next!
B00ARAO720|5.0|Good story, colorful characters and a plot that meshed together well enough to keep anyone see it to the end!<br />Very Good Movie.
B00999DFP0|5.0|I discovered this show in reruns and once I got hooked I had to have the DVDs. They do not disappoint.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|( ... to continue from the title of this rev. ) ... they should have stuck to the script of the original story, made the whole thing more scifi(ish) or even threw in a few more mutated life forms or perhaps some space travel . .  but this was a yawn fest, more political in the style of a watered down coup that is not what I was looking for as a remake of the original.  I would have to tag this movie as TOTAL RECAL ( SAITO ) .. Same As Title ONLY!!<br />If I wanted to see something about Politics I'd just go to CNN.com or The Huffington Post.<br />Fail only if you have NOT seen the Orifinal that may have been somewhat low tech as 2013 goes but still way better than this .....ugh... Movie.
B007V65R54|5.0|Finally a book that's geeky enough for me. It addresses the science of prediction from many angles and provides ample references and footnotes.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series keeps proving that even TV without profanity and promiscuity can be very entertaining. Each character has great depth. You truly feel like part of the story.
B00B32X786|5.0|I remember the first time I saw this film and immediately after thinking about how much it reminded me of friends. There are a few different plot lines but it is about growing up, coming home, old friends, new friends, new life and a funny romantic buddy movie about beautiful girls and hanging out. The cast is one of the best I've ever seen and the acting in fantastic. This is a great movie, do not hesitate to watch.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|Too much Javert with Mr Crowe.  He is poor in the film and worse on a CD.  Otherwise, CD is OK.  Will never match the Broadway/London versions.  Also Sasha Cohen doesn't come off at all on the disc - nor does he in the film.  Sorry to say these folks blew the film - not as bad as The Phanton of the Opera film, but getting close.  Jackman is better in the film than on the CD.  Hathaway is superb in the film - but difficult to listen to on the disc.  Sadly, an overall disappointment from one who wanted it to be as spectacular as West Side Story
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My granddaughter, who's 4 and grandson, who's 3, love this game and it keeps me amused too. Great for hand and eye control along with being just fun.
0805092447|5.0|I chose this book because it was one I grew up with. I wanted my son to have the same books and fall in love with them like I did when I was a child. It took a while to ship and for the longest time I didn't know where it was or when it would come in. I would have bought it from a store in town, but we don't have any that sell books like this. But the book came brand new as promised.<br /><br />The books get's 5 stars, but the waiting time and price gets 2 stars. It's easier to drive to a book store and buy it off the shelf.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|only issue i have is with some people in chat rooms are extremely inappropriate.  there should be a radio button to report them without losing my space in the game.  should also be able to add friends without leaving room or be able to get hack to specific room.
B009O07NDY|5.0|We got this for my Dad after he came to New Zealand and saw the Hobbit film, great gift idea.
B002LVVCQM|5.0|I am still reading this book, i am going to give it 5 stars even though i didn't finish reading the book yet, it tells you how evolution made us. and it's very interesting and exciting.<br /><br />Thank you.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|don't buy angry birds, the free version is fine. the ads aren't intrusive and to be honest it's not that fun of a game to warrant 5 to 10 dollars.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|i just finished reading this book and i recommend it to everyone who wants to think about what is going on in this day and age with religion and myths. this book made me think more scientifically and look for the evidence. so if you want to expand your knowledge and think in more scientific way, you should read this book.<br /><br />thank you.
B008JH5HCW|5.0|first off, i would buy anything with guy pearce because i love the kinds of movies and roles he takes. that said, i enjoyed the movie and don't regret buying it instead of renting it. it's short and a great movie to have downloaded onto your kindle that you can just pick up and watch whenever.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|There is more emotion, thrill, excitement and action in the sequel. Marvel really delivered with the Iron man movies and Robert Downey Jr. is a perfect fit. I would definitely recommend this movie. Also the blu ray disc for this movie is flawless.
B000LPLTX6|5.0|must have classic, tour de force by guy pearce, an unforgettable movie. this movie is made by the guy that did batman is that's any consolation.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Another gift for my wife.  She has always been a big Led Zeppelin fan, and this was a great addition to her collection.  She loved it,
B00632HWOG|5.0|no bugs, really easy to use interface, overall i am very satisfied. probably one of the top 3 apps that I use on my kindle fire.
1451627289|5.0|This was another gift for my wife, the Stephen King fanatic.  She loved this book as she has loved all of Stephen King's work.  As long as he keeps writing she will keep reading.
075669812X|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend because he LOVES Lego and he was so excited because he has all of the other encyclopedias to put it with!!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Great music-comedy movie to watch. They were hilarious and if I get I chance would like to see once again

0767803434|5.0|What a performance by Harrison Ford! If you have not seen or purchased this movie you need to. It's a must have for your movie collection! Could this happen to an American president? Watch this movie & guess for yourself.
B00866H7SS|5.0|I loved it. I felt like I was Eva in the book and my imagination was able to run wild.
0783225733|5.0|Apollo 13 will keep you on the edge of your seat knowing that these events actually took place! For those of you that remember seeing this on TV as it actually took place this movie will bring back memories of the challenges that these men & NASA went through to get this capsule back to earth. For those of you who were not around to witness the event it's quite a great bit of history. Full of technical challenges & courage I highly recommend you look to this movie as a bit of history unfolds right before your eyes!
0385344228|2.0|This is one of those situations that happens now and then (to all of us I would assume) where I just don't get all the good reviews. At all!<br /><br />I found myself finding fault with Defending Jacob as I read it, something I really try not to do and don't like to do, as I admire very much what it takes to be an author and think it must be a quite a feat to write a book  . .. but I couldn't help it, the faults seemed glaring and started to irk me.<br /><br />For a start I guessed the ending quite early on in the book. Always a disappointment when reading a MYSTERY type of novel! No of course I didn't guess the ending EXACTLY, but I was pretty sure it would be something along those lines. It seemed glaringly obvious considering how the mother was depicted as thinking and feeling pretty much throughout the book, and her continued and obvious spiral downwards. While there were a couple of times I questioned if I might be wrong about Jacob, for the most part I was pretty sure of how things would turn out with him.  It just didn't seem to be all that much of a mystery really.  Sure a couple of surprising things happened, but I was a little shocked at how I was not shocked by the ending at all.<br /><br />Also, I am one of those people who just can't get over that the therapist said Jacob's heart was two sizes too small! What kind of person (a therapist no less) would tell a parent that? What kind of DIAGNOSIS is that? I can \\"get over\\" or forgive a lot in a GOOD book, as a rule, as in real life people are certainly quirky and say things that seemingly come out of left field . . . but THAT, well, I found it ridiculous. I might have been a just tad more forgiving if by that time the story wasn't already a let down. I suppose the two sizes too small thing sealed the deal.<br /><br />There was only one chapter I felt was really great, that seemed to me to have been written in a totally different style, and possibly even by a different author! The chapter entitled Argentinamade me feel the depth of sadness and LOSS that the family was experiencing. It was a quiet, powerful setting and it made Jacob and his parents seem very human. I felt connected to them all for the first time in the book, I felt truly sad for them. There was a depth that I found lacking previously. That chapter broke my heart, much more so than the ending, because as I have said, the ending let me down.<br /><br />I would definitely liked to have known at least a little more about the victim. All I really know is that he teased Jacob and didn't sound like the nicest guy. Nobody is all bad though, especially not a teen, and if even just a couple of pages had been devoted to giving some hint as to why he might have behaved like he did, and exploring his more pleasant or vulnerable side I would have been able to care more about him. I know the story wasn't at all about the victim, it was about Jacob and his family, but it would have been a richer tale for having more insight into the murdered boy. I feel that I should have cared more about him. I didn't because the only real info I had about him was that he was mean.<br /><br />There were several tangents and unanswered questions that seemed like they were thrown in just to send us down the wrong path. That's okay, that is what mystery writers do, but then those tangents need to ultimately make sense, to have been there for a reason. Otherwise they end up seeming like cheap little ploys.<br /><br />The premise of Defending Jacob is very clever and I was greatly looking forward to reading it, but I feel so much more could have been done with such a thought provoking plot.
B00APUQJLO|1.0|Sick & Stupid Score: 9/9*<br /><br />This is a very sick movie.  Exactly how sick, I cannot say, since I dumped the movie after 35 minutes.  But based on what I did see, and based upon the drift of the movie, I would say this movie would have probably hit a 10 on my Sick Score.<br /><br />As far as stupid is concerned, \\"Cosmopolis\\" is right up there on the Stupid Score, also.  The awful 35 minutes I suffered through was filled with unnatural, disconnected, and ridiculously stilted dialog.<br /><br />I hope the $3.99 I wasted on this movie will save you and many others from making the same mistake.<br /><br />PS:  In the time I was watching this movie, Paul Giamatti never appeared on screen.<br />_____________________________<br />* The Sick & Stupid Score ranks movies from zero to ten in each category. For example, a Sick & Stupid Score of 5/5 indicates the movie is about average Sick and about average Stupid. A Score of 10/10 indicates the movie is so gross and idiotic no one should watch it; whereas a Score of 0/0 is a perfect movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is amazing I love it you should defintley get it. its like taking care of your horse in real life.
B003H9M1Q2|5.0|I am a HUGE Disney fan and believe this movie is a classic that every person should see.  Above all else, it is the story of a young child (elephant) who overcomes being bullied by using his \\"flaw\\" to catapult himself to success.  The other issue covered in this movie is alcohol use. **SPOILER**  Dumbo finds out he can fly after getting drunk and waking up in a tree.  If you want a movie to just press play and leave your child alone for a while, this is probably not the best choice, but then again, most Disney classics are not good choices for this purpose.  This is, however, a movie that the entire family can enjoy together in an atmosphere where discussion of what happens in the movie flows freely.  Watch Dumbo with your children, you won't regret it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a fun game. Could make it easier to buy items and horses could be cheaper. Otherwise cool game.<br />You should really try it out
B009RH9J7W|5.0|Excellent design. Fits the Kindle HD like a glove. I love that you can position it at different angles. All in all a excellent product, I certainly would recomment it.
B000IDEORY|5.0|I had avoided this movie for a while because I was cynical about old movies from before my time but I am so glad I took the plunge and watched it.  The story line is great! I now own this and it is one of my favorite movies.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is alot of fun makes you use your mind thats what I love about it. I have MS so I try everything to use my mind.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book is seriously amazing. I recommend this to ages 11 & up. The hunger games is my absolute favorite book. With all the romance, drama, and action I couldn't put it down. Had me hooked from the beginning.

B004SMYQ8I|5.0|These are my 3rd pair and are so comfortable. If you like barefoot style w more support. Though they are Vibram bottoms (maker of 5 Fingers), I think these are D's. I didn't know they varied widths. I like the top material better on this model. Makes it even lighter if you can believe that. The laces action is amazing. I know this sounds strange, but it's easy to losen and tighten without too much effort.
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|This app is really good and all but this app needs to have a little work on. The racing sometimes stop and it takes a long time to download. It also deletes the egg after a while a when your almost done it starts you over and you have to sign in to Facebook to get in the game and sign a bunch of stuff for your child or siblings.
B00992CF6W|5.0|But i can not find the update even though it came out already but every thing else is good. I love it.
B008N1V11U|5.0|This game is great! i would suggest it to anyone and everyone! Get this game! You wont regret it!Have Fun
B009IEXKXI|4.0|For a book that is mainly centered around one person in one place, it is a real page turner.<br /><br />Great Book
B0086449YA|3.0|I'm an enormous Knopfler fan. &#34;Hot or What&#34; is the only track on the two cd's that grabbed me. I love the tongue-in-cheek approach; it takes me back to Muddy Waters' Hootchie Cootchie Man!!  Privateering is better than his last cd (I can't even remember what it is called, but it's red).
B006LR0XLM|5.0|This makes file usage on the Kindle easier. If you have and use dropbox on your computer, you might enjoy the service on your Kindle. It's great for syncing documents, schedules, etc. Use in conjunction with a file manager for ultimate control.
B000Q76K1A|5.0|The movie was well directed and the action was fast paced and intense. Matt Damon did an excellent job as Jason Bourne.
0719079276|5.0|If you're unused to critical theory, as I was when I got this book, the ideas inside will stretch your mind and hopefully bring you helpful new ways of considering not just literature, but all forms of communication from TV ads to obituaries. Reading this book in a discussion-based class was helpful as I could fine-tune my understanding of the ideas Barry presents, which are not always crystal-clear due more to their complexity than to his presentation of them.<br /><br />This book will expand your ways of thinking. It is mostly interpretation of theory and introduction to key players in each theory, not original texts from those critics.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|wont load or let me redownload. kind of bad. lame. needs to be fixed so I can play more of it.
0618871713|5.0|This is an example of the graphic novel as a work of literature. The words and pictures are seamlessly intertwined into a well-crafted, interesting book. I'm not a particularly visual person, but I loved the intricate symbolism and repetition throughout Bechdel's story. It's a memoir, and the topics discussed inside will not appeal to everyone, but the book is certainly a pinnacle of the craft.<br /><br />After reading this, you'll think differently about graphic novels and your family.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I love this case for my kindel, I have it for my old Kindel and the new HD and I have to say it is the BEST
B00631VJIC|5.0|I chose this rating because the music is exactly what I was looking for.  I will recommend this music and Amazon to friends and family who are also interested.
0765325950|5.0|Thank you Brandon! I have been reading this series for over 20 years. I couldnt have wished for more, the story is fantastic!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|SOA is one of the best series I have watched in a long time. When seasons 5, 6 and 7 become available I will purchase them , too.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Star Wars is going down as one of the best trilogy ever made. It has drama, love, adventure, danger, and more. A great story line, I just love this movie!
B009MO57H6|3.0|I wish it were, maybe I should have wrote it for them.  It went in circles and wasn't zombie grusome or scary.  Well it completes my collection I hope they stop making because they'd really have to redeem themselves from this one.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Captivating story. Am looking forward to seeing the movie.<br />Will be looking forward to other books by this author in the future.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The book was recommended to me by several friends and none of them told me what it was about. I finished it in less than 24 hours. Because of college, I haven't really wanted to spend time reading more than I have to. Reading dense philosophy and history books really take the fun away from it. This book got me back into the swing of things. I loved it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Just as good as the weather channel on TV, and I can pick the cities from which I want to receive wearther information.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this book! Very interesting read, and I almost felt like I knew the characters personally. Tugged at the heart for sure
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is epic and supper fun this is a good game its to easy though you should add more things to make it harder like hard mode it is a really awesome game but add more stuff please it is awesome add more things it would be beyond epic
1616550414|5.0|This book is everything I was expecting it to be and more! It's absolutely amazing; from the concept art to the copious amounts of information that it supplies, the Legend of Zelda: Hyrule Historia is a beautiful display of everything you'd ever want to know about Zelda. I absolutely love it and would recommend it to any fan of the series. Well worth the wait!
B0067LY4WG|3.0|It's ok but I like other cds of his better.I STILL LISTRN TO IT AND IT IS OK. THE CASE WAS BROKEN.
B008F9E306|5.0|Ill buy basically any joint by T.I but this was exceptional...love it. S/o to the hommie...some people dont get in trouble, trouble gets them
B008N1V11U|5.0|Fun; Great animation; the voices are right on.  The game could've been a little bit more challenging though. Overall I would recommend this to a friend if they watched the trilogy to understand the concept, characters, and the giant gap between the regular Dark Knight and this one.  If I could find. a Batman Begins and Dark Knight game,  I would never do my homework.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I loved the first temple run. But I love this one more! It is a great game for all ages and I can't wait fir updates. &lt;3
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book...looking forward to the others saw the movie first this is much better than the movie. Would defiantly recommend it.
B005DOKM9M|1.0|was not what I had expected. I wanted something that enclosed the kindle while using it.  So Ipurchased a leather one that seems to meet my needs better.  Was not sure how to return the original one so I still have that one.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|It was a great easy read.  Highly recommended<br />Very well written with enough intrigue to keep me turning pages. Loved it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Great App!l. Dependable accurate no<br />more snooze button makes me get up to turn it off never late to work since started using this great free instantly satiating app
B004X4R49Y|5.0|Great acting and very entertaining.  Colin Firth is very convincing in this role.  Good all round entertainment for everyone to watch.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was skeptical when I started this book.  But it more then surpassed my expectations!  I have been recommending this book to everyone I know.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love that it has missions and challenges, It makes the game interesting and competitive.<br /><br />I would like if the lower the coin cost to buy characters. (in game cost) no actual money
B004SBX112|1.0|I really haven't been able to evaluate it because it downloads, then I get an error when it installs, or I get an icon which when clicked leads to a message that the App is not installed. Got a message that the original Angry Birds App I have been using for months needed updating, then it was gone too. Couldn't install Bad Piggies either. I can still install some other Apps, but getting some signs that my Android 2.2 mini-tablet may be failing as the anniversary of its purchase approaches.<br />I tried re-installing the Amazon Store App as well. Sigh...
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I have this program on both my smart phone and my Kindle.  It is very reliable as long as you remember to &#34;save&#34;.  I like that it tells you when the alarm is next schedule to ring.  My schedule changes constantly and this is an easy and reliable alarm.
B004HD61KE|5.0|I totally enjoyed this book...a great mix of science, history and adventure and what could be. Now I'm tempted to go back and read some of the earlier Sigma Force books. Hope they are all as good as this one!
B005LF9OCE|5.0|Barney Stinson has to be the greatest mastermind of all time to pull something like this. To bad boobs came in the way of the sweet touch of victory.
B0094PXB2G|4.0|Great movie! If your into drama, thriller and what I love most, heart touching movies, then this one's for you.
1577316517|4.0|love the concept,and its content...but slit to put 1 standing up,was not adequate...was disappointed in that aspect of the design
B004GYY714|2.0|I did not find this app to be very good. It list all the radio station from all over the country but what you need to know is that they are not all able to play on this app. I was trying to listen to my local country stations in Colorado and it always went to a radio station in Alaska. I also checked my favorite country stations in Alabama and it always went to the same station in Alaska.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is great I would like ignite they would add the great things on the Pc but all in all this is pretty great
B00AGKHFCA|4.0|I totally loved it until I got to the Elvis song, Hate that song , didn't fit in with the other classic old songs , Then I noticed that there is a lot of Chris Botti sprinkled through out the CD.  A little bit to much Chris Botti, he sands out to much. Aside from that I would give it a 5 star rating , since I am a big Fan of Andrea Bocelli. I did notice that David foster produced it and that's why Chris Botti is his friend, But the Elvis son g ruins the integrity of the CD....  Good thing I can skip that song now.
B009JBZH54|4.0|Great -- worked fine - have not checked out the extras but so far so good. Really glad I bought it since I always like the series
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great fun to play and keeps your mind active....would highly recommend it to my friends.  Is very easy to play.
B005LAIH2W|2.0|Was not at all impressed with this film.; either the movie itself or the story line. I would not recommend it.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Great book. Lots of action!!<br />I read all of Clancy's books. He has a flair for alot of action and suspense
B002R5QPRI|4.0|I'd seen this movie before and really enjoyed it and wanted a copy. I would recommend it to fan of Costner and Houston.
B00A8SPNYW|1.0|It's boring, not exciting at all. I would not download it for free and I have deleted it off my kindle.
B009POCG2C|5.0|Haven't opened or looked at the copy I bought from you. But anything with Clint Eastwood is good. What does Ultra Violet copy mean? Do I need a special machine to view it?
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I can't put this one down! This one is so interesting and challenging. I highly recommend this game for everyone!
B005S9EJ14|3.0|Was somewhat disappointed in this movie. It was not what I thought it would be. I found it rather depressing.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I so love this app... So  many sounds to choose from and special features (clock and etc).. I highly recommend this one!
B0072GPQNG|4.0|Was disappointed in the movie. It lacked something but I can't say what. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This game is fun! I was so into it BUT I wish there were more quests. I have done them all and would be great to have more!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Loved the series on tv and wanted to own it. I would recommend this series to anyone who is an anglophile.
B007TXN4TK|3.0|It was fun when it worked and it's pretty glitched. Right now, I have to try to delete it and reload to see if that will make it work.
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|Being a lover of books, the descriptions that she used and narratives that she gave captivated me. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves the old history romance, or occasional murder mystery. Such an interesting plot twist at the end that was very unexpected
B00992CF6W|5.0|I played creative for a while then my friends told me and showed me survival and it was beast.Only 1 thing I wish the Tnt would explode in creative
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I really like this because I have trouble falling back to sleep when I wake up in the middle of the night. This app has some wonderful sounds that allow me to relax and clear my mind so I can go back to sleep. I also like the free sounds you can download from the blog.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app it is so additive can not put it down. always new games to unlock and love the fact u can earn more cash playing the same game over.
B0063GORYU|4.0|The game offers ranges of difficulty, so you can continue to challenge yourself. The graphics and transitions are very smooth. movement with a finger or stylus works fine.will keep you entertained especially during those lulls in travel times.
B0044XV3QY|3.0|I must be dense, missing a few brain cells; I cannot for the life of me find the in-film commentary for the movie on this product!  I purchased this product solely so I could get the insights of the director, main cast, and every other person they would pick to chime in for such things like costume design, cgi, and other topics.  however, after looking through the product a few times, I am shocked to not see film commentary.  Where is this feature?<br /><br />The other features in this box are excellent, such as the process of how they made the movie (while not directly tying to individual scenes such as a commentary would do), the artwork, and the rest.  Just wish I could find the commentary on this product because I clearly feel let down.  Especially for paying $30 for this product, and I can get commentary on special editions of other films for $15 or less.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This is always a good app. Have never had a problem with it. Would absolutely recommend it. Lots of things require an Adobe Reader for them to work.
B004XDYJRU|2.0|As other reviews have stated, the update for this app fails to install despite numerous attempts (Kindle Fire HD, Kindle Fire 1st gen).<br /><br />I have enjoyed this app and want to be able to (should be able to) enjoy the updates as well. I have emailed the developer and have yet to hear back from them as to whether there is a fix in the works or if they even acknowledge that there is a problem.
B000I9WWJA|4.0|Very interesting movie. Grabs your attention and doesn't let go! Denzel's performance was fantastic. One of his better movies. Cast was well put togther for this movie.
1616550414|5.0|This book almost weighs like a school text book but in this case it is a good thing. It is full of so much concept art work that gives never before seen insight into the story and characters.
B008IGP8QE|5.0|My two daughters, 7 and 5 love the show and music so I decided to buy them the CD for the holidays. It has all our favorite songs and we have been listening to it almost everyday for a month. My 5 year old has been bopping along to all the tracks and the three of us have our personal favorites which we discuss whenever we listen to it. Great show and CD.  Looking forward to hearing more Austin and Ally music with each new show.  They are both so talented. Disney shows and music are awesome. The content and lyrics are clean and wholesome and you don't have to worry about bad language. Great product for the under 10 crowd and parents too!
B008HK3XKO|4.0|I like the case as a case, it does protect my Kindle so I can toss it in my backpack on my way to work and it doesn't screw up the screen and absorbs the minimal impact presented by the few items in my bag, and it's not hard on the eyes either. Can you run it over with a car? No. Can it swim? No. I like that the Kindle can fit inside it two different ways without obstructing any of the ports, as there are a few apps and such that only work in one orientation. The only gripe I have with it, however, is that having it for a month and 2 days the hinge that holds the Kindle upright on the back seems to be a bit worn and loose. Not that there's a lot to be expected in that department taking the construction materials and cost into consideration. That, and it still stands straight if I want it to, as the corners of the case do a good job of catching the material on the inside of the cover. All in all, a solid investment if you're looking for a simple, stylish, cost effective cover for your $200 investment.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|i luv luv luv this app! u can cut-grow-comb-shave-color-straighten- curl-shampoo-rinse-blowdry-and put the characters in hats and glasses!!! luv this app!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got this for the kindle fire and I didn't get 0.6.0!! all my friends got it for the I stuff but we androids don't have it what's up with you Jeb and Johan!!!
0316227706|5.0|I bought this as a present for my dog loving brother, but the entire family flipped through it over the long weekend. It was a real conversation starter!
B004MYF4SS|5.0|This was the first Peter May's book I read and I thought it was fantastic. Very well written. Very interesting. Great setting. Great mystery. I highly recommend it.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|Shows a great way to get what you want and the most from out of your life! Great read. Will keep it handy for quick reminders.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I have read Gone Girl and Dark Places both by this author. Sh is a creative writer and writes well. I would read any of her books.
B001AX60KU|5.0|If you are an Elvis fan, this is a must have CD set.  I have been an Elvis fan most of my life.  I had the opportunity to see Elvis perform live at Madison Square Garden when I was 12.  Having been (and listened to a recording) at that concert versus these performances from '68, I can honestly say that these capture Elvis at a time where I believe he was at his peak.  He was healthy, totally engaged, and very committed to delivering top notch performances versus his large arena concert years in the 70s.  There is a lot of repetition because you essentially have 7 performances when you count: the TV show, the 2 sit down jam sessions, the 2 stand up shows, and the 2 rehearsals.  I liked the sit down and stand up shows the best particularly the one that is on Disk 3 (the second set of shows).  Elvis is relaxed, joking around, and unscripted.  What a treat it would have been to have been in that audience.  It really was like the first &#34;Unplugged&#34; type of concert that has now become more commonplace.
B000YAX3P0|5.0|Obviously I bought this product because I love Amy Winehouse. Her style in this album has influence in many different areas in jazz and the old school.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This was a very deep and well written book. I love the moral of the novel and his perspective on time. I would recommend this book to anyone searching for a deeper meaning in a novel.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking Dead is awesome!!!! Don't pay for Stealer, uh I mean cable. So this is the best route to watch our favorite show. Thanks Amazon!!!
B00AU2B0DE|5.0|Once I saw this in my mailbox today I was so so happy. I'm in love with this album already!
B005HS00XW|5.0|We have one or two other Peter Gabriel concerts.  While I probably prefer the other concerts more, this one grows on you.<br />It is different in that it is with a full orchestral backup, rather than a conventional band.  He definitely is still the star of the show, and the music is excellent, if a little bit different.<br /><br />I actually bought it, watched a few cuts on YouTube, then felt a little disappointed.  I gave it to my wife on Christmas and we watched it and after watching the entire concert I thought &#34;actually that was a lot better than I thought It would be after<br />watching it on YouTube&#34;, and in fact it is close to living up to his other concerts.  A nice addition to my concert DVDs!
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|Sherlock Holmes:A Game of Shadows was just as entertaining as the first.Ending is a surprise leaving many avenues open for the next one.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|You're probably bored with the first Temple Run and looking for something similar. Temple Run 2 is your answer. Building off the first success and pushing the envelope of faster processors, this game does not disappoint.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This is a great app because it is free and you can talk to who ever you want. It's like a texting app basically. It is fun and easy to use. I suggest this to anyone
B00B01XDTI|5.0|Not too bad good sound and affects which is what i like. I think the 3rd one will be good aswell i guess we will see :)
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I enjoy this game because it requires you to find a variety of solutions to the puzzle. One variation adds a time component which makes it more challenging as well, so there are levels of difficulty to challenge the player.
B000QFQE4U|5.0|I remember while I was growing up the turmoil that was created during this time.  My family tried explaining what was going on.  It was a frightening and sad time for us.  Denzel played the role to the max.  Loved it.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|a classic and my son LOVES this series.<br />it replaces his tapes that he had befroe, glad they came out
B008JFUTUY|5.0|Yes, the Academy has a \\"Best Documentary\\" category, and this film is a lock to win it. But as Michael Moore stated, this film is so good that it could have possibly earned a \\"Best Picture\\" nod.<br />It's the most fascinating documentary I've ever seen-- and I've seen many documentaries.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|wanted to have some Phillip Phillips - winner of American Idol last year.<br /><br />easy to download - don't have to wait for physical delivery and was enjoying immediately.
B009KHBDUU|1.0|I normally like Tim Burton movies, I get his dark humor and viewpoints.  And Johnny Depp has always been a pleasure to watch in action.  This movie however was horrid.  The storyline was muddled, Johnny is a caricature of his Capt Jack Sparrow character, Chloe Moretz can't stop pushing her huge top lip out the entire time and does little &#34;acting&#34;.  The only saving grace to the movie is Michelle Pfieffer.  She is still as lovely as always, and played a very strong matriarchal figure in a ho-hum script.
B00973902K|5.0|like to be able to download songs<br />have an apple and use mp3 downloader and goes into my itunes well
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|A fun film for a lazy weekend afternoon. Predictable, superficial, totally escapist. Loved the Celtic-flavored music and accents! There were several truly humorous moments as well.
B008YU0AOE|2.0|Using HP Touchpad running Cyanogenmod 9 (ICS), the ad covers on the bottome of the screen, rendering the app useless
B009X01ELC|5.0|It securely holds my Kindle Fire and is comfortable when using on my lap.  I like the gray color and<br />it is easy to clean.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I love classical music and I found it with this app  It has so many options that I can access including news, classic oldies.  International and local stations.  It has podcasts and probably myriad other options that I haven't looked at
B004X4R49Y|5.0|I enjoyed this movie.  It was well done.  The acting was great. I didn't know about this part of history - the personal problems behind the politics.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|This is a pretty basic case, nothing fancy, but I find it to be all that one would expect from a case.  My husband's tablet fits in securely, and the cover is stiff and strong.
B006WAIV6M|5.0|it is really great book , may be we know all this facts about us and we try it before , but when we see it in words , understand habits as scientist research , we become more understanding about our self ,  scientific facts give us more feel of control
B008WCP2KG|1.0|I really didn't know what this was going to be like when a friend told me I had to order it. It really was not for me...way too raunchy! I only watched a few minutes of it and then cut it in pieces.
B009FZFONO|1.0|HD wouldnt stream.  Standard worked great.  The Walkind Dead isa heck of a series though and this productlets u get caught up.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I don't usually read romance novels but the number one listing attracted my attention.  It was a typical story of an abused wife seeking a new life in a remote town.  But I enjoyed the read, as it was well written and had a sufficient plot to keep the story going.  My wife and I are looking forward to seeing the movie when it hits the theaters this month.
B008I34YCG|1.0|This disc does not play on my laptop or my Oppo BDP-95 universal player.I see others have had the same problem so the manufacturer must have made a defective batch.I hope they fix this soon because I really do want this disc in my collection.Sending it back for refund
B001JRB16U|5.0|This was the only thing my granddaughter wanted for Christmas.  It's so much more appropriate for a 13 yr. old than a lot of the stuff that's out there today.
0545265355|5.0|I'VE READ MY COPIES SIX TIMES.  Other teachers love it, theolder generation loves it and my granddaughter can't put it down.  I repeat.  Great Stuff.
B00914JWSW|5.0|How can you not like this fantastic voice. I always keep one of her albums in my car as they are released.
0743270754|5.0|Abraham Lincoln lives in this book.  Doris Kearns Goodwin, like no other biographer, has presented Lincoln with all his humor, his compassion, his strength, his determination, and, above all, his ability to unite diverse personalities into a team that would<br />reunite a nation.  Team of Rivals tells a story that is more than 150 years old.  Yet it has the immediaacy of yesterday's news.  I lived with Lincoln through  all his challenges, disappointments and triumphs--held my breath during each crisis, waiting for the outcome, marveled at Lincoln's wisdom and brillianace in navigating some of the most turbulent waters of this nation's voyage.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|If you know anyone who has suffered a life altering trauma this book will touch your soul.it really bring important issues involving the decision to choose ones destiny to light.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This just came out, so I don't want to give much away.  This is a great season, but also very shocking.  I love though, how you can see the transition of stuck up values, to human values.  :)
B000UZNRS2|3.0|I personally, found this hard to get into. Could't put character connections together. About half way through I started to put it together and read it for a long enough period at a time to make sense of connections. The last quarter of book I finally got it, then enjoyed the suspense.<br />I've really enjoyed other David Baldacci books I've read. Just finished &#34;The Winner&#34; (Great) and half way through &#34;Wish You Well&#34;. But Stone Cold has, to me, some complicated character connections that require paying attention.<br />Would be a good book if going on a vacation or anywhere one can stay with it for long periods at a time so story lines don't get missed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Be prepared to read right through to the end! This series is non-stop action and hard to put down for a second.
B001PPLKI0|3.0|Elvis is one of a kind. Hard to beat. Some of these songs are wonderful but many are ho-hum. Non of the passion he has expressed in much of his music. I feel like he just decided to put a bunch of Gospel songs together and just went through the motion. I expected more.
B007SGM084|5.0|I could not put these books down! I will admit that I had some doubts going into this. I worried that it would be all the risque and crazy scenes and no story line. BOY WAS I WRONG! I greatly enjoyed the story line and the development of the characters! I highly recommend this book for everyone but beware... you wont be able to put it down once you start it! Cant wait to see what else E.L. James comes up with!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The much improved graphics in this version make it worth the updgrade!  I'm not a big gamer, but this improvement makes the game more fun.
B0063GORYU|5.0|fun and challenging.  I love this app. great to play anytime. I always have to play-just one more round!!! like to try beat my best score.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is so fun there are ziplines and minecarts temple run is my favirate mobile app but sometimes it picks up the wrong movement but other than that this app is so fun
B005DOKL3E|5.0|This cover fits the Kindle Fire just fine.  I like that it isn't big, bulky and heavy as I just need it to protect my Kindle Fire while its in my purse or I'm carrying it around.
1400052181|5.0|Rebecca Skloot's The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a well-written and entertaining book. A great work of creative nonfiction.
B004HX4RT6|5.0|I was never a big Chess player before but now?  I'm hooked.  I need to play with experienced people and ask questions as we go.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is a very cool app. It is a lot better than the regular Temple Run. It is very exciting when you start to go faster. The only bug is the &quot;Save Me!&quot; button once you die. It gets annoying, but otherwise it is an awesome app!
B004V5A7K8|4.0|has the potential of raising blood pressure while playing but its a fun one.  Just don't yell at the machine when it wins
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so cool I play it everyday my little brother loves it also u should get this game
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I finished the first and second books.  Now taking a break before finishing the 3rd. Katniss is my hero. Can't wait to see the movie
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This app is amazing it is just pure fun it looks real Butt the only thing I don't like is that every thing cost Mony bio wepon /virus butt it says u can unlock it but I docent  yet uhhh stupid spell check I ment dident. yet so it is Mony well spent if u aren't sure yet look at the trailer called plague INC trailer so that's y u should buy this app.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app, though it would be nice if the updates came out at the same time as it does on Apple products
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run is so fun! They. have more graphics stuff love it lobe it beloved it fun it run it always.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|These actors have been around for a while, but are still on their game. Interesting premise, but some improbable moments. All in all, I enjoyed it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series is so damn good !!!!<br />DONT MISS THIS ONE , if you do you really missed out .
B00867GHS8|5.0|Certainly worth upgrading from the DVD to the blu ray...deserves the accolades & is a must have for folks w 3D television capability...
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|I use this app frequently and highly recommend it.  It works really well, allowing you to dispense with both USB cables and the Amazon Cloud Drive.
B0020BUWX2|4.0|So realistic great story. However no such thing as a four ton pickup truck.  A lot to think about. Loved the angel stories.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The best game out there! Can't wait til the next game. This one is a keeper. Not just for the little ones.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I was so used to the first edition and this seems more harder. I think the path should have been programmed in a different color because you cant distinguish from the bushes and the other things around.  Other than that its OK, but I definitively prefer the first one.
B004N6369Y|5.0|Loved this book and all the characters.  I would recommend it to everyone to read.  This book keeps your attention and you don't want to put it down.
B0070XFNDE|4.0|Well written and very entertaining; Shadow of the Wind was the best.  This book is a close second.  Brings clarity to the 3 part series.
0345803493|5.0|I LOVED THE WHOLE SERIES OF FIFTY SHADES OF GREY! I THINK THIS WAS MY BEST BOOK EVER!! WORTH READING
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|This show consistently provides entertaining and twisted dark storylines.  I love it!<br /><br />While the continuity isn't always great and the stories can be really convoluted, it was a great show.  Season one, about the murder house, was just as entertaining.<br /><br />Jessica Lange and Evan Peters knocked it out of the park, just like in season one.  Loved their characters.  Sara Paulson brings her A-Game as Lana Winters, a character that I liked less and less over the length of the season, but still liked overall.<br /><br />Overall, strange, creepy, scary, gory, weird, musical fun. :)
1878424114|5.0|I love Deepak Chopra since he is so wise but also so practical. This book is not for people who want to go deep into the matter of spirituality. This book is for people who are looking for practical, clear, helpful day to day recommendations about how to live a better, more spiritual life. Every once in a while when I feel that I am loosing track, I read specific parts of this book and it alsways gets me motivated to get back on track again. Filled with truths so simple, but so true!
B00127RAJY|5.0|But its actually a good workout! Being pretty active and fit, seeing a personal trainer and running daily, this left me sore!
0765325950|5.0|If you waited 20+ years for this book to come out then I doubt this review matters... Some characters might as well not have even been in the book while others I couldn't even believe made a cameo... Padan Fain...well Hello thanks for stopping by....<br /><br />Overall, the ending was fitting and the book was enjoyable so go ahead and buy the book already.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great game awesome duo with temple run<br />Great graphics, new features, and cool moves and improvements. from the last temple. run
B00785P2QC|4.0|word like the first VC. is really a lot of fun. love that you are free to make whatever you want
B00181JGI2|5.0|I am now a zen dudist , not sure about the bowling though , my give it a try later
B0076DELIG|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. Harry Bosch is one of my favorite detectives, intelligent, intuitive, determined, and darned resilient. The twists and turns in this plot kept me guessing. It's a good read.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I love this movie, I could watch it over and over and over. I enjoyed watching the soft side of the character emerge. The little girls were classic and loveable.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Easy to use.  Detailed and accurate .  I refer to it nearly every day for a complete report.  I approve! Love it.
B006WQLH7G|4.0|I didn't think I would need an anti virus scanner, since we are operating a linux kernal.<br />However, these geeks that write these things are getting clever. It works well, and isn't a memory hog.
B004X75RK4|4.0|This was a very cute romantic comedy...didn't give it 5 stars because it was a little out there/unbelievable one too many times, but I laughed out loud so definitely 4 star worthy, maybe even 4.5!
0375826726|5.0|Bought this for my Grandson and he loved it. Bought another book at the same time and he loved them both. Good price too !!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and loved the first one. Gideon is delicious and him and Eva are on fire. The sex scenes were HOT HOT HOT!!! I was disappointed that this book featured more possessive and jealousy by Eva than Gideon. Plus, I did not like that he pushed her away. I wish there would have been a danger of Nate stalking Eva and Gideon going all crazy over it but we didn't get to see it. What Gideon did for Eva was incredible. We finally know about what happened to Gideon in the past and it was heartbreaking. I can't wait to read the next book and hope we see more jealousy and possessiveness from Gideon this time.
B00AUA67GQ|5.0|This is the best thing to come along.  It is sooooooo user friendly.  I love it.  Easy and quick to enter any notes at the drop of a hat.  Again, love it.
B001P06GX4|4.0|I played this once and loved it.  So when I had a chance to buy it, I did.  It's a fun and mentally challenging game.  Good price, too.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|The writers have some difficulty in moving the plot which is sometimes redundant, as are the action scenes in the woods fighting zombies, and in prison scenes which seem to never end and do not bring the plot anywhere.  There's a bit of a &#34;Sopranos effect&#34; in that way, but overall the effects and acting are excellent making it a great series overall.
034580404X|5.0|These books are so enchanting! I am halfway through the second book & I have such a hard time putting it down. An excellent read!
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|has anyone else had trouble opening this app my kindle wont let me download it???? also is there problems with opening the app I don't get anything
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell tells a story, using statistical samples and everyday examples that apply to most people. He reveals the true hard work of becoming an outlier, a 'freak of nature.'
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love this game. It is so great!! The last level is the hardest and no matter ho  many pine cones you save up to defeat the evil whatever he is, th  pine cones get depleted..  for me the time ran out every time I played the last level but luckily they have the halfway point so I just started from from there
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|Greatest series I have ever watched. Buy this series you won't regret it! The sound and picture quality is unmatched.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|Ok so this is my review 4 diary of a wimpy kid the third wheel. The 7th book. I think it's a really good book I luv the dog days book & last but not least cabin fever!!! This is my review my is also know as hannah j. Gaouette. Thx 4 reading this!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i cant stay off of this game. i love the graphics!!! Much better than this first version. the kids love it too.
B009X01ELC|4.0|I really like this cover--I really wanted a cover that could fold all the way back instead of being open like a book. Also, I really love that it can stand up either horizontally or vertically. Overall, it really like this case. My only complaint is that I thought that closing the cover would make the Kindle sleep, and opening it would awaken the Kindle. As far as I can tell, this doesn't work on mine. But it isn't that hard to just hit the on/off button. Otherwise, I like it.
B0044E9LW6|5.0|Whats not to like, come on it's Dio in his prime. Never get enough of hearing this amazing and truly remarkable legend.
B00407PNY2|4.0|I  thought the movie was pretty good for an old flic. Great car chase with lots of action. A must see at least once.
B00005RHGL|5.0|Tombstone is one of if not my favorite western.  Its very accurate to the stories I've read on Wyatt Earp an his brothers and Doc Holliday in their adventure in the boom town of Tombstone. Amazing cast ,acting ,portrayal of events and it gives that escape from reality to the old western days. Truly captivating.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is a great hidden objects game. The puzzles provide a challenge and the story is thrilling as it unfolds.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|don't be fooled if you think game is going be boring. its not. its fun. you don't have to buy coins if you don't want to. just wait. I have 18000 coins /on level 217 and have not spend one penny to get those coins.
B003Y7AR4K|5.0|Picture quality is great.  Everything is lit up so you can appreciate to the fullest the detail and intricacy of the costumes and stage art.
098357670X|4.0|Extremely well thought out and written. The man is a classic! Exactly what I wanted. Very detailed. It also not only shows you how but makes you think. That is the sign of a good how to book.
B009X01D9U|5.0|This case is ideal for me. It is the correct size and has the features I prefer, especially the revolving feature. I also like the color.
B008MM9630|5.0|I really like this game. It has cute stuff.my only problem is that the quests start making it so you have to spend your gems. It takes me forever. You have gems, but it never seems enough so that you can complete the quests.I don't like taking my time on quests. I want to go onward.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A little bloody and Ya it was very good so read this book it's good and cool and fun and inspiring
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I was told that I had to read this book by alot of friends. This book was a real fast read.
0956010903|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a huge fan of the movie. They enjoyed this item very much. I recommend this purchase.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this site. I have done alot of craft ideas from here and also receipes.I have recommended this site to my friends.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I started playing Temple Run and recently upgraded to the second one.  They are both good games and a good way to waste some time
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I would rate this app for everyone,and yes I am a brony. Anyway there is something I just don't get. I mean you can get princess Luna when you get princess celestia and almost everyone knows princess Luna IS nightmare moon. It's SO weird because the whole app is about the ponies getting away from nightmare moon. But besides that this app is great im on level 41. I REALLY want RD (a.k.a. rainbowdash) :D
B009UX2YAC|1.0|it was a great app but then I opened it and all my data was gone. I could not find a way to get it back. they need to fix this.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I hate games that are designed solely around selling me more coins to play the game.  It is fun for the first few minutes, but then waiting 30 seconds for a new coin gets old at about the 2 minute mark.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Muy bien! Awesome show. That's my opinion. I'm not a movie critic so don't expect me to give much more than what I have already,
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|WORKS GREAT ON MY PHONE, BUT DOES NOT WORK ON MY KINDLE FIRE HD.  4 stars because it does not work on the Kindle Fire HD
B003TQKVGU|5.0|I can't tell you how many books I've read about the Subconscious Mind. I started with, Think And Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill. Since then, I've lost count. My trip is separating the Subconscious Mind, from consciousness. Joseph Murphy says that the conscious mind is kind of like the limo driver for the Subconscious Mind. The conscious mind get directions from the all knowing Subconscious Mind relaxed in the back of the limo. If the conscious mind knows where it \\"Wants\\" to go, it must be able to convey this information using the proper method[s] to the Subconscious Mind. Those methods are where this book will take you.If you know these methods, the Subconscious Mind will work for you. If you don't know the methods, you are going to work for your Subconscious Mind, and deal with a program that is working against where you really want to go. That program could have come from anywhere. Maybe even past lives.  The audio[CD] forces you to clear your mind, and stay focused on what's being said.  When was the last time you tried that???  The answers we are seeking are all there. You will have to listen again and again and again, but each time, you'll hear what you missed the first, or second time. Amazon also have this in book form, and kindle. This is a very good purchase for anyone who is SERIOUS about making a change in their lives. You have to take breaks as you listen to it, to sort of collect and organize your thoughts. Use a pen and paper for the instructions given. I say again, this is money well spent.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|80% great album. Lana's voice is what carries these songs. That deep sultry sound is magnetic. Keep up the great work!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|the first temple run is better I think. some of temple run two is not fun as the other one.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I got this for my samsung galaxy tablet it was'nt available before and now it was which is great cause I use my tab all the time to browse and shop. I look at things on amazon all the time. This app is really helpful.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|Fast fast fast shipping! Sealed, I love this so much. Watched it as soon as I got it. Shipped with the other dvd set I ordered, which I thought would risk a slower delivery but it came faster than the earliest estimated date. Thank you!!!
0060763280|2.0|Good reading, valuable information for practical application - I use it every day, first in the am and then in the pm just before I go to bed. I have a millionaire mind!
B007HO392S|5.0|Carrie Underwood does not disappoint. She is so good. I bought this for the song Blown Away but she has a song called 2 Black Cadillac's that is great!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Pretty fun game and I get 3 gems for rating!<br />only been playing for 20 mins but I think I'm gonna be addicted....
B005EZJ3MW|4.0|I mainly bought it for the song &#34;For the love of a daughter&#34;. Most of the other songs are pretty good.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|just what I needed, yes I would recommend this to a friend.<br /><br />very easy to use and easy to download.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|GREAT romance novel! It reminds  me  of the movie \\"What Happens in Vegas\\" a little, but better. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is into contemporary romance novels that aren't too over the top!
B00992CF6W|5.0|the best game that you will love it is worth it is Awesome the game does not lag on kindle
B009LDCZ7I|4.0|I bought this series after reading other reviews, and now I wish I had started at the beginning.  Claire Danes is fantastic as a CIA agent with her own issues.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|very good story line and kept me interested throughout. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I haven't used this alot, but it has very cool sounds for those who want quiet, peaceful, restful time. You can build the sounds you like best by combining different sounds to play at the same time (ie: ocean waves and chimes, etc.) Fun app!
0920668372|5.0|I ordered two books for my 22yr old twins for Christmas.  This was our favorite book when they were little kids, and after I misplaced our original book I wanted to replace it.  What better way to share a beloved memory, than to share a beloved book, again and again?
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love being able to travel light with just my KindleFire instead of a laptop... This app lets me get into my Facebook account easily and efficiently.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is a five-star realistic fiction book because out of all the books I've read, Catching Fire was most suspenseful and created a lot of imagery in my head. I like the part when Katniss met the President. I would recommend this book to a person who loves very suspenseful books.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible keeps track of where I left off reading and listening last. I use it during my Bible Study and read along as I listen to the audio. I like the &#34;verse of the day&#34; that I use at the beginning of my study time and the fact that it gives the reader many options of how to read/study the Bible. I've chosen to go front to back and try to read/listen/study to 4 chapters daily.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is a really nice app especially if you use pinterest for finding new meals, because you are then able to bring your entire set of directions with you to the store and you will never forget another ingredent!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I love being able to access my emails and internet while traveling light with just my Kindle Fire. This application helps me do that!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I'm so addicted to this game, I play it all the time! I love this game, totally get it. Also, way better than the first one.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I like the music and the sound effects. Boards are pretty good. Tiles are easy to discern from each other
