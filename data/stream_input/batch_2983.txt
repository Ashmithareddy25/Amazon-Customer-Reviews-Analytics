B00CP4RZCU|5.0|great show, a Must have for any Black Label society Fan. excellent footage and nice close up's . great to see Nick on his solos.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This was a very impelling compelling read I really enjoyed it from start to finish. Parents should all read this.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really awesome game I really like it. It teaches about responsibility for younger kids or older you can race clean
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|It was better than I expected. I really enjoyed the character development and became rather attached to the world the author created.
B00B89LZ4C|1.0|surprised to find the packaging had been taped shut.  this was intended as a gift for someone, and now couldn't give it to them as the package had obviously been opened.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|This cd is so good. I never was a fan til I heard them on the radio. I did a little research and realized, this disc is the one for me. SO FUN!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Excellent continuation of the back-story of Kirk, Spock, Khan, et al. Continues to answer questions, as it leaves more to be answered
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It's a nice read. It went fast, started and couldn't put it down.<br />It's a fun book.
B003IY47JK|4.0|Despite the fact a few songs did not really grab my attention, the ones that did make up for it. Very creative and mesmerizing.
B000GCFG7E|4.0|I have read about 13 Lee Childs/Jack Reacher books. The Hard Way was one of the best in the series so far. OK, I like the character but some of the books are better than others. At this point in time, I think this is about my favorite. It's up there with The Killing Floor, Die Trying, The Enemy and Tripwire.
B00E7SFAAG|3.0|The game is very well made and tons of fun. I would have given it five stars, but I have to open it several times before it launches. I get a black screen more often than not. Galaxy s3
B009RX7IX8|5.0|The fifth season? It was funny, a little sad and left us hanging. Need a lot more than five stars...enough said!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love the game,  my daughter thinks it is so funny! she loves all the minions everywhere and the costumes are fun.
B002W1GCX4|5.0|Great album...love the fact that it has a lot in one set. Worth having even if you don't own any other Bowie albums.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Works great. Have never had a problem with it. More reliable than my phone. Especially great since it's free. Have tried other free apps that did not work as well.
1582701709|5.0|I read and listen to the cd and then I wanted my children to read the book. I have practice the Secret long before I read the book. I have walk the path for many years.
B006FE83UE|5.0|It's really weird. I've only ever seen parts of this film. I bought the DVD to add to my collection of the 100 greatest films of all time according to the AFI. The parts I did see were awesome. Peck is magnificent in this film. I always loved his acting. I have th bok too.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I would rate higher but on my kindle fire HD 8.9 in. When i get a message it wont pop up on the status bar like it does on phones...... please fix!
B003AWRMCE|5.0|A terrific film. A true classic in every sense of the word but...not his best! I like &#34;High Plains Drifter&#34; better. Why? Can't really say just do. This is a great film none the less. Great performances from every member of the cast. And Eastwoods direction and composition is perfect!
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|what a superb story teller. a good modern story, so well narrated, he always challenges you to make connections before he makes them himself. a splendid book, one of his best.
0783225725|5.0|My favorite Eastwood film. Why? Can't really say. Just is. A good story. Great acting. Great directing. Exciting, different and mysterious. Rest in Peace stranger!
B00354YA4A|5.0|one of the best stories i ever read, so delicately original. what an ending! very interesting character development and a great love story to boot.
B0004Z33EG|5.0|I'm not a huge Stallone fan. Rocky was great. One of the all-time great films but this film is different but still a very good film. The ones that followed...not so good. This film is based on a true event in the Northwest. I don't recall exactly where or exactly when but that's where the idea came from. Stallone is very good here. Brian Dennehy is great as usual and Richrd Crenna is solid as usual too. Exciting and has something to say! We should listen!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Like Hosseini's other books, it is rich in language. The stories are compelling and I love how they connect. However, the ending didn't feel complete.
B000I3PERS|5.0|It's great film. Was best picture of the year. Evrything about the film is excellent. History, excitement, action and war!
B009KEN87O|5.0|This is a great game that you can play over and over again.  A great improvement on classic games like Galaga and Space Invaders.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|This a classic movie. I bought it not because I love the film, I'm sure it's very good, but because it's on the AFI top 100 films of all-time. And since I'm collecting all 100+ films I had to buy it! And because I love Audret Hepburn! She was such a beautiful and classy lady and a great actress.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|The first Pulse I received from Amazon was defective.  The button stuck and the Bluetooth was unreliable.  I requested an exchange with Amazon the next morning and by the following day I had a new unit.  This one has worked terrifically.  The sleep analysis has been particularly interesting.  I believe the step counter is probably accurate to within 10% or so of the true value as it will record accelerations due to things other than steps (e.g. riding in car).  I haven't evaluated the elevation measurement (how many feet has been climbed in a day), but that seems high.  However, it is a useful item to measure daily changes.  I use the silicone clip to attach it to my pants pocket and it has been very secure.  The battery life is exceptional; I have had the Pulse for a week and is currently at 50%.<br /><br />All in all a remarkable product.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|LOVE THIS SHOW! What can I say about this series that hasn't already been said? Nothing really. Buy the series and enjoy!
B00594XOZU|3.0|I had Kik on my Kindle Fire HD and it worked fine. It's a cool messaging app that lets you send pics, and interact with friends. However, when my Kindle started shutting off on its own, I was able to get a new one with the one year warranty. Once I got my new Kindle I downloaded the app again off my cloud but now it won't work. It won't let me log in. I tried deleting it from the cloud and downloading it a couple times but it won't work. Kik is a great app but know that it may or may not work with your Kindle Fire HD.
B007SPPANM|5.0|I gave this film 5 stars because...well because it was such a huge success at the box office. and because it's a very good film. Great? I suppose you could say that but it's been done before and I think better in many ways. I understand how a 3/4 scale model was built and all the other details but...I don't know. I guess it's the story for me. Doesn't ring true. But the young women and girls loved Leo so...I bught it because it's on the second AFI top 100 films of all-time survey list from 2007 and I'm trying to collect every one.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Anybody used to or new to Pinterest needs this!!!!! Works great as an app on any device! Must get this, especially since its free!!!!:) You will addicted by the first pin!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Really enjoyed the film. I don't remember if I rented the DVD or watched the film on TV...either way I loved it. Leonard Nimoy is really looking old but he's still Spock and the guy playing him as a young man was very good. All the stars who play the younger versions of Capt. Kirk etc. were excellent! I loved the story line and the action and adventure. I'm not one of these people who pick apart a film from a technical point of view. I hate those people that do that. 99% of people go see a film to be entertained and don't look at the technical jazz. Very few people are educated in the art of filmmaking so they go to see the movie for fun or because it was made from a book they read or a true story that inspired the film.  Just ordered the DVD. Haven't seen the new film that's out on DVD now but I'll be ordering it soon. Gotta add it to my &#34;Star Trek&#34; collection. Have the complete original TV series on DVD and the complete set of the movies with the original cast members. Intend to buy the films made from the second series &#34;Star Trek: The Next Generation&#34; someday soon. Never was a big fan of that series but I liked a couple of the films I saw so I figured... why not?
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Before I read this book, I had some friends telling me about it. To me, it just sounding like a sappy love story. But I gave it a shot and it was more than about love. It  was about fighting for what you believed in. How loss can make life unbearable. How sometimes you just need to gut it out and be grateful in the life, and people you are given. I totally recommend this book to 13 and up.
B000002J09|5.0|Stairway to Heaven! And one of the greatest guitar pieces ever! The album is great from start to finish. But what a finish! Jimmy was and is a guitar genius! His playing was so fluid. That's why he played on so many people's recordings prior to his Yardbirds gig. The band is tight and powerful. They were at their peak on this album. Love it!
B007SGM084|5.0|This book was Amazing! I was hanging on every word. Wish there was another trilogy! Or part two no questions I would buy!!
B00915G6MG|5.0|I now have all ten seasons on DVD and am anxiously watching season eleven as we say goodbye to Ziva. :( But I love NCIS!  :)
B005PK57IK|5.0|I truly have enjoyed this series.  The acting is excellent and the plotlines keep me interested.  It is definiely worth watching.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book was a wonderful testimony of a life of a man who gave his all to the cause he believed in.....what a tribute to him and all of the brave people who serve our country..... Thank you to all of them and their families.
B00EY8ARYS|2.0|This is a huge disappointment thus far!!! It is poorly directed, poorly written, and has extremely weak sets! This great set of actors have obviously been provided with very weak material and a lack of guidance by a poor director who attempts to hide his weak sets by frequent close ups. The dialogue is also extremely stilted, making this very difficult to watch. I couldn't finish the second episode. But, hey, it's still early. Let's hope someone pulls a rabbit out of his or her hat and fixes this weak and already dying series. Good Luck! As for all the five star ratings - someone must be getting paid to praise this sow's ear.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book ties up many of the lead ins to the final conflict. As the bit players are washed away, who will win in the game of thrones?
B00005K3NR|5.0|This movie is a favourite of mine and always has been.  Spacek's performance in this movie really is fantastic. Piper Laurie is great too.
B0031RS4V6|4.0|Great book another well written book by lee child well worth the read kept up the great work new one soon I hope
B00005RDRO|5.0|This is another one of those classic old kids movies that just won't die.  Its wall to wall stars of the time and they play off each other so well.  Totally twee and cliched, but who cares! Take the time and have a laugh.
B00FAXLCWW|5.0|So great! I'm really glad I purchased. Fun to listen to, fresh, will definitely have you driving with the volume up and windows down.
B009PMEEY2|4.0|Plays without error with no WiFi. That's the first thing I test on a new game...if it won't let me play without WiFi being on, I delete the game. So Azkend passes that test.<br /><br />The graphics are beautiful. I'm playing on a Kindle Fire HD 8.9, and even at the large tile size on the tablet, the images are beautiful. The designer clearly spent a good deal of time on the art for this game, and it shows.<br /><br />The gameplay is easy. Drag your finger to match tiles that are touching and have the same image in them. Then the images disappear, the tiles turn blue, and new images fall down from the top. Turn the whole board blue and you get a special piece that you have to get to the bottom of the grid to complete the level.<br />My daughter is five years old, and she loves this kind of game (I've had a game called Candy Swipe for a while that is a \\"drag & match\\" and she loves it), but I can play it and have just as much fun. She looks for any three tiles that match...I try to take out tiles that will give me a much larger number of matching tiles a few moves down the game (you get bonuses for having very long chains of matching tiles).<br />New obstacles are introduced from time to time...different types of tiles that have to be removed in a certain manner...so the game does offer an increasing level of difficulty as you play more.<br /><br />The one negative issue is that you can't go back and replay a level without wiping out your current \\"adventure\\" and starting over. I can understand the logic of wanting the \\"adventure\\" mode to progress through the story, but there should also be a \\"Free Play\\" mode or something where you can go back and replay levels.<br /><br />This is a very solid 4-star game, and the inclusion of a way to replay levels (either to improve a score or so the kids can play levels that don't have all the extra types of hexagons) would make it worth 5 stars.<br />Get it as the Free App of the Day? Of course! There's nothing wrong with the app.<br />Worth 99 cents? Absolutely.<br />Worth $2.99? Personally, I wouldn't pay over $1.99 for a 4-star game. If the author fixes the replay issue, then I probably would say it's worth the asking price.r />Worth 99 cents? Absolutely.<br />Worth $2.99? Personally, I wouldn't pay over $1.99 for a 4-star game.

B00BSBU4EC|5.0|My little girls just love watching this movie and was awesome when they found it in amazon for a cheap price
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It was racey and raunchy, but the parts I liked best had nothing to do with those parts.  Don't know that I'll read the other books.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|All Lewis books I have read have been great. In this one he explains with an incredible capacity for story telling what went wrong in 2008<br /><br />The beginning and mid parts of the book are more complex (when he explains the financial products), but towards the end it's easy to make sense of it all<br /><br />A number of characters are truly inspirational (Eisman). As it is some of the practices described in the book (e.g.  Oppenheimer's  \\"nepotism rule\\", which meant that when the firm hired a relative  he wouldn't be paid the first year until  others decided how much was he worth it.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|I have mixed feeling about this one.  As he usually does, Gladwell finds some fascinating life case studies to look at.  As for proving his thesis though, it just doesn't feel as successful as some of his other work.<br /><br />While the idea that advantages and disadvantages are not always what they appear to be is an intriguing one, I found myself asking over and over is Gladwell proving that thesis or just providing some exceptionable examples of where that is not always the case.<br /><br />I think the chapter on dyslexia is a good example.  Yes, there are some very successful people who happen to have dyslexia and maybe that struggle with dyslexia did help make them successful.  But all the people who struggle with dyslexia and other learning disabilities who don't find ways to adapt--what about them regarding this premise?  Gladwell just glosses over that these specific examples are quite exceptional.  I think that's fine if you central theme is that we can't assume that all people with different kinds of struggles receive no benefit from those struggles, but Gladwell was going for something much bigger than that.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|A lesson for us all. Here are a few more words for the review. What the heck is wrong with succinct?
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|I made the horrible mistake of reading this book before bed each night, and the nightmares that followed were unspeakable. How we are all not living in an atomic cesspool is beyond me.  Read it but be prepared to lose all faith in anything the government tells you..
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book is a a straightforward and comprehensive synthesis of fitness knowledge that provides its readers the necessary foundation for solid fitness training.<br />Mike Matthews has as much brain as muscle power needed to come up with integrative content that not only tells people specifically what to do, but why they are supposed to do it. This allows anyone to truly understand what the road to fitness is about.<br /><br />What is makes this book remarkably solid is the extensive research that the author went through to truly dig deep into the very core of fitness. Everything stated in this book is properly backed with scientific studies. And as bonus (at least for the geek that I am), the reference materials are properly cited. This shows how Mike Matthews really knows and understands what he is talking about. A more investigative reader may also look further into the source materials should they wish to.<br /><br />This book is definitely valuable and life-changing.<br /><br />- William Lim
B009HNDSL4|5.0|So funny, so great...best show on TV.  I just love this show. What a great cast. Phenomenal writing and acting.
B000003TA4|3.0|The CD was in great condition, but the case had a crack in it when I got it in the mail.
1250039037|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much,. The story line is good and I enjoyed the characters immensely! I highly recommend it!
B008Y212PI|4.0|Don't force<br />Stop forcing people to review apps because we will give stars off. I like the games but dislike having to do this to continue to play the game.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I think it's cool that you can breed dragons and get Sun and moon dragons. I personally love this app get it now!
B0058UXHHK|1.0|this book was so predictable... and boring... I do not recommend it !  Save your time and money...don't buy it
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Well acted. Very different from the book. Good production quality. Worth watching once, not necessarily worth owning. It is not a staggering artistic achievement that leads to deep introspection. It is an action movie with a human touch and good acting. Rent don't buy.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|This &quot;upgraded&quot; app won't load half the time and, the other half time won't even work properly. Not worth the time to download!
B00B23O96A|5.0|This reminds me of Eric's late 70's work where there was plenty of laid back guitar and female vocals. \\"Every Little Thing\\" could be on \\"Slow Hand\\". The phrasing is classic EC. The playing is understated and brilliant. Vocally Eric sounds like he has for 4 score and 7 years. \\"Further Down The Road\\" is re-worked much like his take on \\"I Shot The Sheriff\\". The material is smartly executed. He and Paul McCartney sound relevant and natural together on \\"All of Me\\". \\"Angel\\" reminds me of \\"Promises\\" from Backless. Which really illustrates how this is all a throwback to a better time for Eric. No blazing solos, just grab a stool and start pickin'. Bring in some slide, some pedal steel and silky background vocals. All perfect. I keep reading on here how Clapton is not giving his fans what they want. Well I've been a fan for a long time, and this is as good a Clapton record as you're gonna hear. Sit back and enjoy!
B001NXDSLQ|5.0|Awesome movie of one of the most iconic moments in music history! Would recommend this movie to fans of music and historians alike! This film features some of the best performances I've witnessed from diverse artists!
B001EC2IXK|5.0|Newman scores big!  The cast is great, the plot is simple, and the story really tells itself.  Never, never, never give up!
0525478817|5.0|this purchase really filled my expectations, and more, excellent buy, good price, excellent quality, no problems in the delivery. I recommend
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Zombies are just the enemies. The story was about humanity and survival. Great story .I would have liked to know how it all started though.
B00AEFXWF6|5.0|This is probably one of Nicolas's cage best performance and personaly my favorite movie he has done. john Travolta is also excellent in this film. those two actors are a good team. I can't really say much more than that this is a well made movie and the acting is awesome and the story is great. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
B00FEHXCIG|2.0|I didn't rent this movie expecting it to be an Oscar contender. I thought it would be \\"mindless fun\\".  It turned out to just \\"mindless\\". I am still a Guy Pearce fan despite his character in this awful adaptation was boring, predictable and soul-less. I found myself just waiting for the cool end-of-credits scene that fans enjoy with this franchise.  However, that was just as lacking as the rest of the movie.  Sorry guys, I really tried to enjoy it but I just feel like I lost I.Q. points as well as wasting my time and money.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app. User friendly. Love the hourly forecast feature. Being able to choose events is useful since my son is in sports and likes to fish.
0312330537|5.0|Mr Roberts knows how to write! Highly interesting read--characters are well defined. Strong spiritual message hidden in dramatic events. Would recommend to a reader especially if one has an interest in Eastern events.
B00008OE4W|5.0|I saw this one years ago and wanted to have a copy for my collection.  It is a great movie and well acted by all the stars.  Good suspense from the beginning to the end.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love being able to get entertainment from other sources! Chromecast was simple to set-up and use.  New content is continually being added. I may be close to dumping my cable TV provider!
B00005V9IL|3.0|Maybe the person who told me about this movie over-exaggerated, but I expected something more ... or something else.  It seemed long to me without much meat to it ... kind of like I felt when I saw Close Encounters of the Third Kind.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I have gone off wheat in June. Over the next 3 month, I have been able to stop taking the Arthomax (Life Extension) supplement for the arthritis in my knees and I have lost 5 pounds without really trying.
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|Very well acted and a good storyline too.  If you like thrillers that keep you wondering what happens next, you'll like this one.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I like this better than the regular solitaire. Easy to play and understand. I play for hours and am still challenged.
B002436WJE|5.0|I almost thought I was watching a James Bond movie.  Good plot, good acting, good action.  I was pleasantly surprised.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love playing spider solitary. This app is easy to use. Has undo key  Has great graphics I love it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoy this game plenty but isn't very relaxing! Makes you pay a lot of attention to detail and think outside the box.
B00CVQYMB4|4.0|I've already read &#34;The Secret&#34; and &#34;Magic&#34;  they were wonderful books.... a real breakthrough for me..... &#34;The Secret Daily Teachings&#34; is a repetition of what has already been said in the other two books. However, i was happy to be reminded of the wonders of the law of attraction!!!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is a great bingo game, lots of different rooms to play in, including the daily tournament room where you get five free rounds plus you earn free credits each day by completing the rooms by collecting all the pieces.
B0089LOG02|3.0|A lovely story and endearing characters but a bit predictable. Writing style did not evoke the depth of feeling it could have. Drama seemed stilted. Could be a great book for teen or pre teen, especially one who has been adopted. Handles some dark stuff without graphic detail.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I have been enjoying this game immensly. Just started playing it 30 min and I'm hooked.  There are plenty of hidden clues/steps to keep me once my toes. No level is alike and there have been many &quot;a-ha&quot; moments that I really got me.<br /><br />Definitly one to add to your collection!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book is wonderfully written for being almost a journal-style format. I am so very glad I read this before the movie, I could actually understand the small parts of the movie and enjoyed it that much more. I hope Mr. Brooks writes more!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I enjoyed this novel very much it was the perfect story of love, action, terror, suspense, it met my expectation with high standards.
B00EHMG358|5.0|love the authors works<br />their stories are always off the beaten track.<br />hope they keep writing more and more and more books.  enough?
B00ES3X9Q2|1.0|This book is very hard to read if you are under 13 years old. Some parts of the book make no sense at all<br /><br />  0 STARS BOOO!!!!!!!!!,
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very cool game, makes you think and fun!  I kind of wish it went to other rooms to continue...that would be fun too.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I can't figure out how to get coins to buy costumes so I need help so I can. It's really annoying
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|Okay... Gosling is a true mystery man in this one, and pulls off a brilliant performance without very much dialog getting in the way. The entire movie is just very sharply done, and the directing is perfect, with a straight to the point approach. And the haunting soundtrack adds terrifically to the whole experience. Those that were bored by this one. I can only say I have sympathy for them. I've watched it five times now and it gets better each time.
B006KX3GXO|3.0|There is a lot of features that this app can do, but you will have to put the time into it...to me its more for a teenager ....the frames and shout out are kind of cheesy.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Any animated movie lives or dies (in my opinion) by their voice characterization. No matter how beautifully crafted, if I can't believe the voice fits the character then it dies. This film has a nice cast of people that, despite the familiarity of Sarah Silverman, makes for characters you can care about. However, I really didn't even miind her at all; she slides into her part just fine. It's interesting to see how this movie will fare 10 years from now when the supporting references and characters to real video games are more obscured by time.<br />Wreck-It Ralph is to the gamer generation what Who Framed Roger Rabbit was to the Warner Bros/Disney/Fleisher generation. This movie had every opportunity to be filled with nothing but sight gags with other video games, but that takes a back seat for the story. Which makes for a great watch.
B0066WJLU6|3.0|The Led light and bright but not really sure what the other features are for...you can light up the main screen on your phone...but who really needs to do that?
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|The cast in this movie worked brilliantly together, and Jennifer Lawrence was simply amazing.  She is so believable in any role she plays.  Bradley Cooper was also fantastic.  There were scenes in this movie where I could not stop laughing, which is my idea of a good movie!
B0070Y46UY|2.0|this book makes absolutely no sense to me! jumps all over the place, and is really boring....1st time ever movie is better then the book!
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Very well acted, great story.  Not as good as the book, but what movie is?  Still very entertaining and well done.
B0035JRVR8|5.0|Directed by William Wyler, filmed in Rome, with Audrey's screen debut, Gregory Peck and Eddie Albert.  Love Love Love the movie.
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|Another wonderful cd from my favorite band. Would listen to this over and over all the time. Hanson is the best.
B006IYFCIM|4.0|There is an inaccurate application of algebra in the book on pages 172-174. It's about a solution for ball and bat math problem. Two equations .1 + (1 + .1) = 1.2 and .05 + (1 + .05)=1.1<br />illustrated in the book is to test for wrong or correct answers. Here's one equation to find correct answer.<br />  Suppose ball cost is X then bat cost is X+1.00. Total cost 1.10 leads to an equation X+(X+1.00)=1.10 Here is steps to solve the equation:  2X+1.00=1.10<br />  2X=0.10<br />  X=0.05.<br /><br />Results are ball costs $0.05 and bat costs 0.05+1.00=$1.05.<br />  Therefore answering a problem intuitively may lead to correct or incorrect answer. But applying algebra appropriately always gets correct answer.
B00B5QGPZC|5.0|Very impressive. It would be nice, though, to have the captions in English. Besides that, it is great! I just think he is wonderful.
B0044AEBXY|5.0|This album may be the beginning of the \\"Uncle Phil\\" era of Genesis, but it still has the earmarks of earlier works - long pieces without lyrics, lush musicality, and riveting performances by all the musicians.  This is my go-to album when I can't decide on what I want to listen to, and I'm never disappointed.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|Live all the songs she is special girl with amazing voice just wow perfect ! U will love this album pure talent ! Love her!
B001JAFYFG|4.0|Yeah it's cheesy.  Yeah, there are logic potholes a mile wide.  Yeah.<br /><br />The 70's synthesizer music is awesome.  Farrah Fawcett (with that blond feathered hair) is so pretty it's almost painful.  Jenny Agutter - just wow.  And Peter Ustinov is totally awesome.  Plus the story isn't half bad.<br /><br />So get your bell-bottoms on, set the popcorn near the lava lamp and groove to Logan's Run - there's way-worse ways to spend a couple of hours...
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Absolutely amazing.  No words can can completely express how much I enjoyed this book. Would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy books.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|What can be said? -- other than, in a world where pathetic mediocrity is hailed as megahit wonders by paid promoters, Pentatonix has created a true gem.  A beautiful collection of classic renditions, the album is Classy.  Tasteful.  Timeless?  No doubt, Beautiful.<br /><br />This season, turn off the MTV, with the grinding and the twerking. Grab the kids -- yeah, even the teenagers.  Get some premium hot chocolate, holiday cookies, get some card or board games, and play this beautiful album.  Memories will be created that will last a lifetime and beyond.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game.  All of my siblings have it and tyey all love it.  I hope you will enjoy this game as much as I have.
B00422LESO|4.0|Really enjoyed Jr. very relatable book. Goes well with the movie I think it does the book justice. Read it!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I absolutely loved every page of this book and couldn't put it down.  Compelling, well-written, page-turning and a dash of mystery.  Loved it!
1442337966|5.0|Great I am now going to order the Secret in an audio book.  I have listened to it twice already and am getting more out of it each time.
B000NDI3SK|5.0|We watch it over and over.  I gave the set to a friend as a special gift.  Definitely recommend it.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Really fun game.  Works very well on kindle fire.  Some puzzles are quite challenging.  No pesky ads.<br />I found myself just wanting to play one more game until I had the whole picture done.
B006AZZPCM|2.0|it worked really well on the kindle fire before the update now it doesn't even convert the files into mp3 and save to your kindle like it did before, I don't like this app anymore please change this????
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|This CD is great, in some ways it is a timeless classic. The whole album sounds as if they recorded it just after the never say die album. The lyrical writing on this endeavor is very relivent for today with the standout song methademic on the bonus disc about the world's growing addiction to meth.
B000FCK8ZK|4.0|It is a great book, don't get me wrong. I made the mistake of watching the entire series before reading the book and it made it harder for me at times because when the characters do or say certain things in the book I'd have a hard time picturing that character saying or behaving that way.  The descriptions of the characters are completely different than on the show. BUT other than that it isa great book. A great TV show as well :)
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I could not put this book down.  It's a good thing it's a rainy weekend.  Loved the story and the insight to the characters.  Would love a follow up to everyone's lives...did Rachel go to New York?  Did Cecelia stay with John-Paul?  At any rate, it was a very easy book to read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Thank you so much for giving us a lot of fun times playing with you!<br />We hope that you won't get sick from all the bananas.<br />Minionly yours!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|this a good game but like I said I loved it cause the chacters u did but I like the most are the ending or last missions of the game to Me this is one of the best angry birds games
B009IF6U98|5.0|If you want a night of laughing then this is the perfect movie! It keeps you entertained until the end.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Not worth the effort.  Very hyped up device that I thought might replace the lack of Intel® WiDi for the home.  However, I could only stream from a pc connected to wifi at standard 480p otherwise very jittery.  I have several DLNA servers in my home that have no issues streaming HD.  Also, since google's latest Chromecast update intentionally breaks AllCast. i.e. the ability to play media from external sources this device is not worth the trouble.  The only thing of use is that I was able stream mp4 format at 480p that was okay video playback.  Very disappointing with all the fanfare, I would be much happier with a mini dlna player device.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Excellent writing style and an amazing story line with fully developed characters.  I will definitely read other books this author has penned.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Good reading, outcome a surprise. He keeps you interested to the end. And it keeps moving from one character to another.
B0002KZAKS|5.0|this is the best mic for its quality and its price. perhaps on par with other brands but very much affordable.i will buy another one of this.
B004X6PRO6|3.0|I'm over halfway through the book and I just can't get into it! I don't find I care about any of the characters. It's a Pulitzer prize winner. I keep looking for what makes t so great but so far, no luck.

B0067RQYNW|5.0|I quickly needed an office product on my kindle and downloaded Kingsoft Office.  It didn't take me long to figure out how to write formulas in the spreadsheet I had and sum columns etc.  GREAT tool, now that I have it on my kindle I ay just leave the lap top at home.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fun and addictive.  Some are so challenging it drives you crazy but you can't stop trying!  It is great to keep you mentally challenged.
B005PK1G76|4.0|For the price this can not be beat! We use this on a baby jogger city mini. There  is only two very small issues for me. One- I would like the zipper pocket to be larger and on the outside of the bin. Second- This does not stay where I place it on the handles. This slides down when not in use. These are not major issues but little things that bug me. Even with that it was worth it to save the money vs the baby jogger organizer.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|I really liked this album. It is a testament to how truly talented this band is. I have yet to be disappointed by One Republic.

B004XDYJRU|4.0|Was having issues with Android 4.3 on my phone. If streaming a station and stopping the stream the TuneIn icon on the top status bar would stick and battery life would be terrible unless rebooted. With new version the TuneIn icon disappears when stopping a stream so hopefully the battery drain will also. Love the app though besides this and have been a Pro user for a good while now. Before 4.3 never had any issues and used daily. Thanks for the update!!

B00A6CCF0K|4.0|If you've ever wondered what happened to the characters from The Shining, this book gives you some answers.  I enjoyed reading it.  My only criticism would be that the story seems incomplete and too short.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I read both of Gillian Flynn`s other books and absolutely loved them. I was so excited when I heard she had written another book. I couldn't put the book down once I started, and couldn't wait to find out how it would end. I have to say, I've never been so disappointed in an ending. I finished the book and was sort of mad I actually wasted time reading this book. For all of the amazing parts this book has, the ending does the characters no justice. Amy gets to live her life as a hero and never mind the poor people who got in her way. I'm giving the book a 2 because the vast majority was brilliantly written, but I can't get over the terrible ending.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Loved the plot twists and could not put this book down. All woman can relate to at least one of these characters and shows the true complexities of relationships. Highly recommend this one.
B009WUBERW|5.0|Excellent movie. You need to see it. And give it five stars and no less. It is great movie yeah
159514188X|4.0|This was a beautifully written book that looks at the interaction between teenagers and how something seemingly minor can have such a devastating impact on others. Totally recommended.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of the best Family Drama's I have ever watched. Can't wait for season 4 nothing compares to the emotions involved in watching this series.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|Could be a little better looking but with the swinging wheels to simulate the flying mode and all the accessories like the hover board and future bar code license plate you get more than enough. One of the more enjoyable builds I can remember .
0143123173|5.0|I started to read these because of the TV show made from them.  As always, the book is better.  I really enjoyed the story as it unfolded.  Great Job Mr. Johnson.
B003TTMFCK|5.0|Greys Anatomy is absolutely addictive. Thanks Amazon for having it available for amazon prime instant streaming so I can get a quick fix when I need one. Lol
B0018OASZE|5.0|Adele's debut is a case study in looking for love in (mostly) all the wrong places. A few songs suggest that the singer is on the verge of finding what she's so desperately looking for. Most of the time, though, she's left all alone, painfully trying to piece together the fragments of her broken heart.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I would suggest this book to anyone who cares about their relationship. It really helped me gain perspective as to why I wasn't happy in my marriage and why my husband wasn't happy.
B009W6OXB0|4.0|Unorthodox Jukebox is a fun and catchy record that you’ll love to sing along to. But if the mere mention of sex makes you cringe or turn all shades of red, you may need to skip over most of the tracks.
B0016492BW|5.0|Of course I LOVE THIS MOVIE.  It is MONTY PYTHON!!!  Well done.  Blu-ray isn't always well translated from older films.  Compared to today's films it isn't as eye catching.  BONUS over today's films - flying cows, unladen sparrows and killer bunnies.<br /><br />Sit back, relax, watch & laugh!

B00F9040HU|4.0|Not to bad, easy enough to play so far we will see how long I can play on free<br />A matching game like the rest like this kind. Hopefully will turn into a challenge before<br />I have to buy to play more levels
1847879071|5.0|&#34;Discovering Statistics Using SPSS (introducing Statistical Method)  is easy and enjoyable reading.  Created a relaxed atmosphere for learning statistics.  Very well written.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Broadchurch was a very good series. A well told story, beautifully photographed, great characters, and wonderfully acted. The drama was tight and kept the viewer on the edge of their seats.<br /><br />This series was reminiscent of the early 90s, David Lynch, American drama, Twin Peaks. Both series, centered on a murder in a small quaint town with a series of interesting characters, suspects. I preferred BC more because eight episodes compared to 48 was more than enough time to tell the story without it feeling drawn out or overdone. This is one thing, we Americans have recently learned from the British. There is no need to have a bloated 22-24 episodes when telling a story that can be wrapped up within a matter of a few well written and acted episodes.<br /><br />I am not sure that another series can be done as a follow- up with this group of characters. That said, I am curious to see what happens to Alec, Ellie, and the town folk after the events of Danny Lattimer. I am just not sure that this is material for another extended story.
0743289692|5.0|If you enjoy reading about different cultures and women's rights/issues, then you will enjoy this novel.  Sparked my interest in other cultures.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I just love this book! This adventure/drama/romance really captures the readers attention.<br />This is a fantastic young adult novel that will certainly fly off the shelves. Suzanne Collins<br />Should be very proud of this trilogy.
0743201140|1.0|Like so many others, I bought a new book on Amazon, to ensure that the code would work for me.  But the code does not work.  If you are buying this book for the code, get ready to be disappointed.
B008Y212PI|4.0|FlipPix is a good app for killing time with multiple skill levels to keep it interesting.  Works great on my Kindle Fire.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|Though this novel was an easy read, there wasn't much new to gain from it.  Some of the characters were well developed; others were not.  Though the author took care not to wallow in the horror of the characters' situation, she didn't provide enough detail to create a clear picture in the mind's eye.  The ending was a bit too\\"Pollyanna\\" and just not believable.  I do not offer high recommendations for this novel.
B00DB2JQ7W|3.0|I have been a Mule fan since 1995, and understandably after Woody's passing and the addition of a keyboard player, the sound has changed.  However, on Deja Voodoo, High and Mighty, and By a Thread, half the songs retained that robust power trio sound that set this band apart from so many others in the mid to late 90's.  Unfortunately, this new album pretty much abandons the Woody sound.  There is no more space in the music, just constant noise.  Each songs comes off as a vehicle for the \\"next Warren Haynes guitar solo\\", and this band sounds bored.  Contrast to the Mulellinium set released a few years ago, this offering sounds below the excellent bar this band has previously set.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|An outstanding  and creative author that had lasting character development throughout the novel.  Read all the books in the series.
B00CTT9646|5.0|Not only do you get a fantastic movie the icing on the cake is the full size phaser that is included with the limited edition gift set.<br />The 3d works well and there are many extras on the disk. My only complaint  I had to order it from the US as this edition is not available in Canada.
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|It is an interesting game. It takes a little while to get the hang of it but it seems to have potential. So far it is enjoyable and I loved the movie.
B00DL47RQ2|4.0|BLUE JASMINE, (2013).  In this 98-minute comedy/drama from writer/director Woody Allen, ([[ASIN:B001EMXS20 Manhattan]], [[ASIN:B00005O06J Hannah and Her Sisters]]), the high life ends with a bang, leading to high anxiety, for a fashionable New York City socialite as a crisis in her life forces her to undertake a more modest lifestyle in San Francisco. An ensemble all-star cast includes widely-praised and Oscar tipped Cate Blanchett, (an Oscar winner for [[ASIN:B001N09BDS The Aviator]], [[ASIN:B0026IUXO2 Elizabeth]]), as Jasmine; the title character; and a restrained Alec Baldwin,( [[ASIN:B003E7PZ92 It's Complicated]]), as her financier husband Hal.<br /><br />Alec's multi-million, fraudulent empire, based upon a Ponzi scheme, collapses and he is sent to prison, in an eventuality thought by many to echo the story of Mr. and Mrs. Bernie Madoff.  Jasmine is left with nothing but some designer duds and luggage.  Yet she flies first class to San Francisco, to take up residence in the cramped South of Mission apartment of her adopted sister Ginger, played by the young, greatly praised Sally Hawkins, ([[ASIN:B00BP4VWRU Happy-Go-Lucky]]). (Both girls had been adopted by the family that took them in). Jasmine is in deep denial of what has happened to her, and is soon seen, if she hadn't been before, in her more rewarding life, abusing vodka and prescription drugs.  With no training whatsoever in the field, she claims to be an interior decorator, and catches the eye of Dwight, a wealthy young diplomat, played by Peter Sarsgaard, ([[ASIN:B001UGB1X8 In the Electric Mist]]).  A cleaned-up Andrew Dice Clay plays Augie, Ginger's ex-husband, bitter because Alec and Jasmine cheated him and Ginger out of their $200,000 lottery winnings. Bobby Cannavale plays Ginger's working class boyfriend.  Louis C.K. plays Al, Jasmine's idea of a more suitable boyfriend for her sister.  The moody, flavorful cinematography is by Javier Aguirresarabe; production design by the adept Santo Loquasto.<br /><br />The beauteous and greatly present Blanchett certainly dominates and carries the film, and it is her performance filling the seats at one of its maker's more commercially successful recent movies.  But the picture does have its notable flaws.  It hints, as do his recent films, that its maker Allen doesn't very often leave the elegant haunts of the super-rich.  Last time I was in San Francisco, the South of Mission area (SoMa) was considered gentrifying rapidly, as the young and adventurous, and artistic types moved in.  Ginger's funky apartment looked fun to me, though it is undoubtedly cramped with two boisterous boys and the sour Jasmine.  Jasmine runs into Augie in Union Square, one of SF's toniest shopping areas, but director Allen has Clay looking, sounding, and eating like a Bronx-based janitor.  The smooth Alec might be transplanted from a boulevardier in an earlier drawing room comedy.<br /><br />Many, many viewers and critics have remarked that the picture seems a riff on \\"A Streetcar Named Desire,\\" an immortal Pulitzer Prize winning 1947 play written by American playwright Tennessee Williams.  (It was filmed in 1951, under the same name, [[ASIN:B00124LYHQ A Streetcar Named Desire]], with an all-star cast headed by Vivien Leigh, Marlon Brando, and Kim Hunter.) And, of course, San Francisco is as well-known for its streetcars as New Orleans, the setting of STREETCAR. Bobby Cannavale's wounded tough-guy resembles  Marlon Brando's Stanley Kowalski .  And, similarly to the Blanche DuBois character in the earlier work, Jasmine is publicly breaking down and coming apart.  She says, \\"Anxiety, nightmares and a nervous breakdown, there's only so many traumas a person can withstand until they take to the streets and start screaming.\\"  The picture opens with her nonstop haranguing an unfortunate older woman who just happens to be sitting next to her on a plane, and cannot move elsewhere.  Later she harangues nonstop an unfortunate woman who just happens to besitting next to her on a SF bench.  This woman, however, can and does move elsewhere.  The woman on the plane, after she disembarks, tells her husband about her experience.  She tells him she didn't know what to do in the situation.  And there, you have, to me, the biggest difference between BLUE JASMINE and STREETCAR.  Jasmine is coming apart before them, but nobody knows what to do about it, and nobody does anything.  In STREETCAR, Blanche's sister Stella, most likely legally the only person empowered to do so, gets help for her: she is taken to an asylum by a doctor, who appears, memorably, to be kind.  His kindness prompts Blanche's most famous line, \\"I have always relied on the kindness of strangers.\\" In BLUE JASMINE, filmed more than 60 years later, only Jasmine's sister Ginger would legally be able to help her, but the thought never seems to cross her mind.  And for all we know, Jasmin might be in danger of committing suicide.  Not what you'd call progress.<br /><br />Still, it's a picture worth seeing, with a commanding performance by Blanchett as a woman who is a stranger in a strange land, intense, unlikeable, sympathetic, pathetic, clueless, charming and fragile.sitting next to her on a SF bench.

B003WKOU0G|5.0|Wonderful, I had seen it before, and loved so much that when my sisters came to visit I wanted them to see it.  Mainly because one of my sisters said how fortunate we were to be born in North America.  Just wanted them to see the difference in up bringing.  Having things does not make raising a child any better in my view and this movie shows this.
B0013TXA5Y|1.0|I really appreciate a good writer, but this author is not; at least not this series.  I was bored.<br /><br />It took much much too long to find any meat on the city of bones and while the idea was ok, it could have been executed much better.  The kids (fifteen yr's) spoke way too eloquently for being so young.<br />Oh, and they do it all to protect the horrible \\"mundane\\" knuckle dragging idiots called humans. You're kidding right?  Mundies?  Horrible.  It's like the writer wanted to use the word peasants, but needed to come up with something different that meant the same thing, so this was the result. Insulting to the mere people you vow to protect from the big bad uglies.  I cringed every time a person was called a mundane to their face.  I would have slugged them.  Stupid. Um and Jace and Clary are brother & sister? Hahahahaha A good writer could have done so much better than this.<br /><br />Funny, I'd heard/read so much about how the author \\"stole\\" this story from another or the entire idea was ripped off from somewhere else...whatever.<br />If you're gonna steal a story, then write it well.<br /><br />I will say the best part about the book was Jace and his humor.<br /><br />He's the only really interesting thing about the story and I can see why Jaime Bower was hired for the movie role.  He was a bit too old for the part, but in the end, it turned out perfect.<br /><br />The movie was much better then the book.

B008D28HYS|5.0|Don't believe what other reviewers write - just try it for yourself!  If you like puzzles like soduku, crosswords, logic puzzles, you'll love Japanese crosswords, and you'll love Cross Me Color.  I first played this type of game with my ten year-old on a Nancy Drew computer game, and had a blast doing it, so I was so pleased to see this as an app of the day.  I got it free, but I would be happy to have payed for it.  It's very addicting, and really helps to take my mind off of the stresses of my day.<br /><br />This is also a great \\"brain game\\" and I'm sure it helps to get some of the neurons firing that have all but died in my gray matter! I'm a stay-at-home mom, and I don't get to exercise my brain as much as I'd like, and this has really helped.<br /><br />Cross Me Color is easy to use, with simple instruction and intuitive controls.  I love how the game eases you into the art of the game: it starts off easy, and builds slowly up to the more complicated puzzles.  Cross Me Color is easy to use, with simple instruction and intuitive controls.  Every puzzle I've done so far is perfect - if you're having trouble completing it, it's you, not the makers of the puzzle, that has made a mistake!  Several times I have thought that the creators of the game had screwed up, only to find that I had missed something.

B00C4QLUFM|5.0|I would recommend this downloaded movie to anyone.  Price was great, quality is even better and this is my all time favorite movie.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|in all the books about wwii that i have read this is the first one that showed me how much the german air force was suffering and how the allies bombing was so effective ... a good read
B001F0ORDU|5.0|The quality of this instant movie is better than my store bought copy, I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Liked it very much it is quite challenging. And would recommend, I just wish there were more levels.I am looking forward to more updates.
B00867HDTA|5.0|Excellent game, great mechanics and it manages to make yo feel great when you score a goal, it is still in progress but I completely recommend it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Loved it. One of the best games. I liked it more than Temple Run and that Subway game. Coz all characters are related to actual movie which builds some new kind of interest to play. Thanks.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Had a hard time finding one to play in the U.S.A on our DVD's but I did. No return hassle free. Love itl. Grandaughter adores it. Watch it all the time. We love Boo.
B001B7CNXI|2.0|The movie was all over the map. Hard to sit through it. I think sometimes Michael Mann throws everything but the kitchen sink into his movies. I read that Foxx and Colin partied like rockstars while filming causing delays. I'm sure this didn't help. The movie never kept me interested and I got bored quick.
B00F9040HU|4.0|It is a great game to waste time on its funny and very easy to playing would get this game for your kindle
B0089BSM70|4.0|I like that it's set in a hospital and that they didn't try to copy the first one by using the house/babysitter location. The hospital worked cause it was quiet and creepy there. My mom is a nurse and used to work the graveyard shift and she says it was eerie working at night, alone in a building like that. Everything else in the movie is solid. Though, Michael does walk a little stiffer in this one, the mask still looks good. The DVD has a great documentary also and commentary track by the stuntman/Michael who played the character. The director seems like a cool guy and gives detailed info on the film as well. He has a track too.
1878424319|5.0|I sent this as a gift and my friend said it changed her life.  So simple, but so powerful. Worth the read, and worth keeping and revisiting!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I just discovered this author.  I read this book and loved it, and then I moved on to several other of her books and have really enjoyed each one.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is Such an intelligent, well written and engaging show. Thank you Amazon for including it in your Prime members lineup!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I chose this rating because the movie was delivered on time and the quality of the movie is great. The plot of the movie wasn't bad, but I liked the first Star Trek better. I would rate the movie itself 4 stars. I would still recommend this product to anyone who has Star Trek.
0316044695|5.0|A true story of heroic bravery, under the worst battlefield duress.  Humbly written. Compelling.  NOT some glorified movie script `based' on actual events.  Lone Survivor is the real tale of the real deal!<br /><br />Marcus Luttrell knew what he wanted to be from a young age.  He prepared for it, then got the best training in the World: BUD/S.  He got the chance to put that training to the ultimate test.  This book is that account.<br /><br />I can only imagine how much better off this country would be if we had a Congress full of Marcus Luttrells.  No BS.  No dancing around the truth.  No fiction.  Honor, Dignity and Truth would once again mean something, which today's politicians have clearly lost sight of, in their singular pursuit of re-election.<br /><br />Get the book.  Read the book.  You will be a better American for the read!<br /><br />Thank you Marcus for putting your experiences down on paper!  May the rest of your Redwing Team, and all those who came to your rescue rest in peace.  Thank you to everyone who serves, or has served in the US Armed Forces.  America owes you a debt of gratitude we cannot adequately repay.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|It was a great story, the concept of not waiting for someone to save you and how absolute power corrupts was woven with grace. Bravo!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is a page turning book. The characters are very lovable. And Christine McKenna does a service to the world by writing it.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Thisvl movie is a classic! Not for this time (technology and f/x wise), but truly an all around fun movie!
B009WUBERW|1.0|Movies like this caused the Newtown massacre.<br /><br />A strong statement but true. It glamorizes the spraying of bullets and mass killing without questioning the moral costs of murder.<br /><br />I grew up watching the rifleman where Chuck Norris played McCain a tough westerner who used his rifle often at times against tall odd. Each time he used his rifle he taught his son a lesson in firearms. Mostly it was about not using it foolishly or improperly. Hooky wood has lots that principle it attempts to be more and more outlandish. The new formula is to shoot the whole magazine drop your gun and pick up a new one and repeat.  It is easy to see why people think mass murder is ok. They see it on TV every day.<br /><br />This movie has almost no plot. The acting is horrible. They shot the whole movie in less than a week and wrote the story as they went along.<br /><br />It could not be worse? Yes it can!  The our Stalone in the lead--calling him an actor is a lie.  Schwarzenegger is almost as bad, an a cameo by Chuck Norris manages to put three bad actors in the same film where there smiles at each other reveal they too know this movie is a joke destined to be listed among the worst ever produced films.<br /><br />I call on Hollywood to regain the moral principals you once had.  The formula for a good movie requires acting, not 90 minutes of shoot guns almost non-stop.
B004SDEP38|5.0|It is a very usefull app, but it needs to be updated more often with  new features or new interface.
B005GY0Y8S|1.0|What's decent about the book...hmmm, well perhaps a bit of the feel of Cannes.  But there are so many mistakes that it drove me crazy.  Bracelet given at 16 yrs then later on 10.  Well there was a murder but not in Cannes. The author provides the typical stereotypes of the French, and of police everywhere. Author does not know north from south in Paris. She doesn't know how long it takes to drive from Atlanta to Savannah, or to Charles de Gaulle airport. Her translation from French to English is sometimes incorrect ( and I hate it that she constantly feels she needs to translate).  Enough said.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I recommend this book to those who are seeking more knowledge of Jesus and his time in history.  It gave me a better<br />understanding of the biblical accounts.
B000HSIEPI|5.0|Long before the US version was aired, I had the absolute delight to watch the original House of Cards<br />with Ian Richardson at his very best.  The twists, turns and dirty political tricks are Machiavelli at his finest. I loved the subtlety and character development coupled with exquisite performances of all of the characters.  Although I loved the later US version, no one can display the absolute English treachery in this classic, engrossing series like Ian Richardson. There's suspense from episode to episode. It's super fun and all involved entertainment at its best! Ian's character, Francis Urquhart or \\"Daddy\\", permeates the entirety of House of Cards.  While being completely focused throughout each episode, I loved watching Irquhart's continued corruption blossom step by step. Each crossed moral boundary leads to the crossing of another and worse boundary. Francis' moral compass steadily deteriorates completely by  series' end.  House of Cards is the epitome of the best of the best and well worth watching.  I adore the series and you will too if you have a penchant for political intrigue and all its attendant machinations. A true classic!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My little sister love this game and so do I and it fun to play on the go so I recommend it to everyone
0529064847|5.0|Bought this for in school use by granddaughter. Nice size, a little larger than expected. Delivered early which was a blessing.
B00594XOZU|2.0|Kik used to work perfectly on my kindle fire HD and now I can't even log on so j have to use a different device
B00A285OOW|4.0|English history buffs will enjoy this, it is light reading and of course fictional but that being said it is based on real royalty figures and I did some research after reading the book and found the characters fairly true to form. I was also watching the White Queen series at the time.
B007HACDLK|4.0|The Mitch Rapp character fits in very well for the spy story line. Vince Flynn has me wanting to continue page after page. I recommend all these books in this series to anyone who likes spy and international intrigue.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I purchased this book on my Kindle because it was cheap and I wanted to see how this book sold so many copies. I still have no idea how it did.
B007RCJNDE|5.0|Gripping....  Never read a 250 page chapter before and this one was far too short...  Thi is a series you will not regret reading.
B00CO6QGCE|1.0|I really LOVE this app, but it WON'T SYNC With facebook, or google plus!!! Please fix this. Because i want to be able to share my mixes!!! I'm on a Kindle Fire HD 7'
B008Y212PI|4.0|Much fun and very addictive but I had several instances when I got an error when performing an action that was correct. Restarting the puzzle and doing the same thing gave the proper result. Going to miss it when I've finished all the puzzles.
B00873GRU4|5.0|This book is brilliant. I would thoroughly recommend it, I couldn't put it down, it's gripping from start to finish.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|I love STNG and this meets my expectations.  I am replacing vhs tapes with these.  I love Blu-ray and these are good dvd's
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Being almost 70 and having sluggish early morning brain... this game wakes me up and gets me going. I find it fun and challenging. Hard to put down. Each morning I try to beat my previous personal best. Thanks for an app that senior citizens can do and enjoy.
B00A4AI19I|5.0|A great composer, a great conductor. If you enjoy classical music and don't have the Brahm's symphonies now is the time to add this to your library.
B002APU580|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. You can feel the chemistry between Elizabeth (Keira Knightly) and Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfayden)! The supporting cast is excellent as well.
B007FIY3VW|1.0|In adequate for any use...go to professional software, i.e., Microsoft Office if you want to do work, better yet get a small laptop.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I bought this because it was cheap and wanted another streaming device.  This is definitely a great device, but I wish it had more support.  Steaming a tab has quite a bit of latency on my 300Mb router, but that really isn't an issue, I mainly use it to watch youtube on the big screen without using my &#34;smart&#34; tv's horrible thought out youtube app that hasn't been update in over a year.  For youtube and netflix, it is absolutely fantastic.  I love  having the ability to be able to stream on any HDMI connected tv.  For travelling, and things like that, it is awesome.  I love that it doesn't break the funcionality of my laptop or phone while using it either.  Before, if I wanted to watch something on the big screen, I would have to use an HDMI cord and have my device right next to the tv.  This way, I can just click stream and go on about my business.
B007T7MIR0|1.0|This thing is a real loser. I paid $14.95 and they should have paid me to uninstall this thing. It is clunky, inadequate for any purpose unless you also like to pull out your fingernails with a pliers. Use a laptop and Microsoft Office.
0812979702|5.0|This is the best golf book ever written. It might sound hyperbolic but I mean. I should qualify that statement with a simple disclaimer: this in NOT a technical examination of the mechanics of hitting a golf ball (although the section about teaching beginners is brilliant). This is a book for people who already have a mountain of technical information between their ears, each little swing key competing with the last, sabotaging their natural ability to perform the athletic sequence of a golf swing.<br />  I'm still selling it short. This is a philosophy book. You know the old saying &#34;he's his own worst enemy&#34;? Welcome to the explanation. We have an analytical part of our brain that dominates our internal discourse. He is omnipresent and opinionated, and he often usurps control of functions that are perfectly suited to our instinctual selves. In other words, he tries to micromanage the very things he's unsuited for. The golf swing is a perfect example. This book teaches you how to give that analytical part of your brain something constructive to do, something for which he has real aptitude--awareness--and frees up the instinctive part of self to perform the complex actions he is perfectly suited for without the constant criticism and absurd expectations of the analytical self getting in the way.<br />  It will take time to condition the analytical self to his new roll. He will try to pop back up in the roll where he is least effective. This is great practice. He's easy to fool. Give him something useful to do and go back at it. You will play better golf than you've ever played in your life, and you will finally know how to enjoy the game without that destructive attachment to the outcome of every single shot that has ruined so many perfectly good rounds of golf.
B0067RQYNW|1.0|It's free, go figure out why, then go watch TV or read a fairy tale on your Kindle. A big waste.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I love playing this game. I don't get to play as often as I like due to my busy schedule but I simply love this game. It's also a great pass time for the kids.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This app is amazing! Tons of launguages, offer English-(whatever launguage) or (whatever launguage) to English. Usable by anyone who speaks at least English, or one of their offered launguages!!!
B001HNE3NO|4.0|The language made me sad. .. the ending wasn't my favorite either but I liked learning about historical events in this way. Good story line.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|its kind of nice that for once a movie follows a books story line for the most part but its incredibly slow moving and there is basically no action which stinks
B000HEWEDK|5.0|This is a classic and one of the first quality science fiction movies of its time......I saw it as a kid and continue to appreciate the story and the characters. This show had exceptional stars and started a long career for Robbie and some of the new faces.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|omg this has got to be the funniest movie ever i can't believe it took me so long to watch this absolutely in love
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, I could feel the emotions of the characters and in some parts I cried I love this book and I would read it over and over
B00D37UQ1K|2.0|i was so excited for this movie to come out and i knew they were going to do such an awesome job but this was just a disappointed medicroe at best
B000XUBFE2|5.0|So very much has been written of the madness of those days. This is a great story about everyday people, trying to survive as people, with their own thoughts, ideas and integrity in place, during an outrageous period of both time and place. There is no doubt in my mind that not all Germans drank the Kool-Aid of the Nazi party. This is the story of one small family who quietly didn't. I loved it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  First one I have read by this author and I am looking forward to checking out more by her.  The characters were interesting and likable.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Over 20 years old but still a great movie.  All three of my children aged 7, 8, and 9 loved it.
B00CS7ZIHI|5.0|One on the best CD's I have bought in awhile...30 Seconds To Mars has done it again and made an amazing CD from start to finish.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Hard to put down once you start playing. I am not one to play games on my phone.  Tried other games that I did not like. This one is cool.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved it.. Kept me in awe the entire time.. Suspenseful, intriguing, couldn't close it until I was finished. Can't wait for the next
6304712936|5.0|This movie is awesome. While it is filled with hollywood, it does shed some incite into the real character that was Mozart.  He suffered from the same child superstar issues that are around today.  I am sure he would be having shows like Madonna, Lady Gaga, and Miley Cirus, if he were around today.  Additionally, the music is the bomb.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I cannot honestly even give this series 1/1,000,000,000th of a star.<br /><br />The author does not understand the culture enough to write a coherent scene. Her prose makes me gag. Slow...slow...slow...and painful (but not in a good way).<br /><br />For those uninitiated people who this is \\"hot\\", let me school you...it is not.<br /><br />If I have to hear one more \\"Oh crap!\\" or her talk to her \\"inner goddess\\" I will puke.<br /><br />THIS IS NOT THE BOOK FOR A SERIOUS EROTICA READER. But, then again, Amazon is busy filtering and blocking all the good erotica and erotic romance because of complaints by people who were suckered into thinking this drab bull is what rocks the bedroom.<br /><br />And STAY AWAY FROM THE AUDIO version. The reader sounds like she has a wedgie and can't get out or her \\"top drawer\\". Her tenor falsetto makes the musician in me weep.<br /><br />Biggest WASTE OF MONEY EVER! And that includes watching the Twilight series (GAG) and Hologram Man (possibly the worst film ever).
B005544V6A|5.0|Very well written show. Fast moving, great banter, love all the characters. Another great USA show. Look forward to Season 2.

B000669GAI|5.0|Lots of great songs and great variety. Some old songs that you love and must have......and some newer songs I had never heard before. Great CD - a must have.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|Loved the movie.  It had such great songs and mash-up songs.  I just HAD to buy the soundtrack.  Buy it!
B00B89WXYS|5.0|One republic nails it again! Good set of songs especially &#34;Something I need&#34; and &#34;Counting Stars&#34; 'cause of its powerful lyrics and beautiful melody.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|My new addiction is Pure Heroine by Lorde, a stunning singer-songwriter who commands your utter attention from the very first note.  She does this without shouting, screaming or using vocal gymnastics, just using cool-clever melodic phrasing.  Her choice in song structure makes listening pleasantly unpredictable and very different from what we normally hear today on pop radio.<br /><br />The simplistic but very effective backtracks makes her voice shine.  Pure Heroine's first track is Tennis Court with its mesmerizing beats and room rattling bass.  I loved it!  It's fun and dangerous to play, especially, when you turn-up the volume and rattle your neighbor's home.<br /><br />Track-2 is 400 Lux, a true alternative pop cut that contains some of the best vocal harmonies I've heard in years.  In fact, throughout Pure Heroine, the vocal harmonies are sublime.<br /><br />Royals, which hit #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 as of this writing, is already a classic IMO.  The vocal harmonies combined with hip-hop and tribal beats are terrific.<br /><br />Ribs, which is track-4, has a fabulous chorus and by this point one can't believe that this amazing singer-songwriter is only age 16.  Next is Buzzcut Season which confirms Lorde's ability to write intelligent, clever-poetic lyrics.<br /><br />Track-6 is Team and it should be the next single IMO.  Yea, it's that good!  The song fuses everything that is remarkable about Lorde's songwriting ability and amazing vocal harmonies.<br /><br />Glory and Gore has a dark-heavy musical mood and lyrics that would have been perfect for The Hunger Games movie - Catching Fire; but, as we have learned, Lorde will be singing instead, a cover of Everybody Wants to Rule the World.  Go figure!<br /><br />Next are Still Sane and White Teeth Teens, which are age appropriate, but, it is the final track, A world Alone, that has really grown on me after a few listens.  I believe this song will rank as one of my favorites in the long run.<br /><br />So thenew queen of alternative music is Lorde, or better known by her family as Ella Yelich-O'Connor.  Lorde is a brilliant new singer-songwriter that music fans will be buzzing about; and clearly, she'll be in contention for the Grammy's Best New Artist of The Year.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game it is great kills time and it's free what more could you ask for. And who does NOT like hitting the other minions
B009JZSC9S|5.0|In the whole story of all the talented guest stars who pop up are Carrie Preston’s Elsbeth Tascioni, who likely is most fans favorite. Elsbeth is a much liked quirky part crazy/part genius lawyer.  Hope to see more of her in season 5 - 10.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I first saw this almost 2 years ago and recently bought it as a gift.  Temple's story is inspiring, all the more so because it's true.  The producers did an excellent job of bringing her story to the screen and staying true to the essential facts.
B001676320|5.0|I loved it because it was well done.  I love Chicago and Earth Wind and Fire.  Great Concert!!!!!  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes great music.
B008XG1X18|2.0|this app freezes a lot for me. it was probly bc i pressed too many buttons bc it took to slow.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I picked this album because I have always been a fan of the Eagles.  This album particularly brings out their outstanding personalities.  I already told all my friends to buy it.
B000JSI7AI|5.0|I gave it rating that I did because the movie was well done and the actors did a great job. I love Horse movies and I wish that there were more like that. and the love that the Guys share for each other is what mu Husband and I have for each other
B00902S0IS|5.0|Wonderful movie - groundbreaking at the time for so many things. Directly related to the creation of Star Trek and other Space Exploration TV shows and movies. Highly recommended.
B000OIZSVY|5.0|If you are a stickler for good grammar and punctuation, and are as concerned with maintaining it as I am, then this is a must-read.
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|A beautiful voice.  The more I listen the better I like it.  After hearing Royals on the radio I went in search of the artist.  I listened to The Love Club and was thrilled when a whole album was released.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Taking one star off because IT is the enemy. Otherwise good book.<br />One of the best I have read over the last two decades
B003YJEXL6|5.0|Cordelia Fine offers a savvy retort to the pseudoscience and sexism that fuels &#34;Men Are from Mars; Women Are from Venus.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|I don't write a review unless I've listened to it at least 10 times.. I ADORE ALL THE DUOS especially the K.Perry song...its pure beauty...I think it was listening to Pandora that turned me on to John's music..he has a real passion for the entire process..did you see how involved he was with getting the last album art work done?? .. Then there's Mayer/just his guitar with beautiful blankets as a sound room. He's the real deal when it comes to making music
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is my favorite app of all time of the 300 or so apps I have on my kindle fire 2.0
B001NHNG64|3.0|I liked this book. The first was better, but this held my attention. I will move forward and read the next installment.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Not the usual type of book I like to read but everyone was talking about it so I thought I'd give it a go. I hated it! Maybe it's just me but although shocking, it really didn't seem to have a good story behind it. I couldn't stand the girl saying the same things over and over and over and over again so I quit reading it after about the 3rd chaper.
B00992CF6W|5.0|great for girls and boys! I wish I was able to do everything u can in Pc but oh well
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love how they added stuff like swinging on ropes and such. It adds a whole new part to the game and of course they still have the way to cheat! Love it! &lt;3
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|I LOVE THE NEW STAR GIRL GAME IT HAS SO MUCH NEW STUFF AND IT PASSES TIME AN  U CAN GET AS MUCH MONEY AS U WANT TO
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|A must read for anyone who may be interested in finding out what Christ(and his movement) was all about before professing to be a true follower of Christ and his teaching. A real eye opener & history we were never made aware of. Also a good history of the brutality during the time of the Roman Empire.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|This is a great story about a young man whose life was changed by finding and loving a stray cat. The story is also about James and his struggle to overcome drug addiction. Simply written, but a touching story. Not War and Peace, but I loved it.
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|This Sherlock Holmes series is the best ive seen, the stories and acting were over the top, if Sir Arther Connan Doyle was alive he would have liked them too.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This is another great book from Gaiman, The story is touching and hits home for me. Gaiman is the master of brining fantasy into the real world.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is such a good game. I get addicted and can't stop playing it. It is the best game EVER!!!
B004X6PRO6|4.0|This is one of those novels that's extremely well-written, but it's just not something I particularly enjoyed reading. Why? Because it's a HORRIBLE story! And by horrible, I don't mean that there's anything wrong with the plot...it's just a terrible situation to be engrossed in for almost 500 pages. Also, the book starts off kind of slow and appears disjointed. Many of the puzzle pieces don't fall into place until much later, so you need to stick with it in order to achieve any sense of resolution. Finally, if you are the type of person who can't read descriptions of gruesome violence over and over again, this book is NOT for you. But if you are interested in learning more about the horrible things that are constantly going on in other countries, this book will definitely give you an unfiltered glimpse into that world.
B00F57VFXO|5.0|I loved this. I was hooked on this series with a 99c purchase of `Operation Armada.' This is better than any of the James Bond books in my opinion including the latest offering `Solo' - save your money and buy `Operation Parsifal' for half the price.
B00594XOZU|3.0|Okay so this app is really cool but now it wont let me log on anymore and ive tried a numerous amount of times and nothing ever happened, im getting really upset becuz of that and i cant get back on anymore. :( can someone plzzz help!!!
B004T0E2S8|2.0|I DL'd this thinking it would run like it does on my other Android tablets, but it doesn't. It shows very poor quality Tab and has NO Play along feature like on the computer and Android devices, and has NO auto-scroll feature either.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Its a clever and very modern take on Sci-Fi and the post apocalypse. It has many mysteries to uncover which will keep you turning the paging even after you have told yourself you really should get some sleep!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Pros:  Works well and easy to set up.  It has a great price.  It is readily portable.  It seems like it has nice capabilities but so far is underutilized by its designers.  For example, the 'casting' feature through the chrome browser has promise but its not easy always to get chrome to play rather than download things you'd like to cast.<br /><br />Cons:  Far too few apps for me to use this seriously.  The Roku iii does every thing this does (except 'cast'), but the Roku does far more, too.  What functionality casting gives me can easily be achieved with Flex on the Roku.  There is no way to interface with Chromecast except wireless.  On setup it is not secured and I haven't figured out a way to secure it.  I find that disconcerting.  Perhaps it is not a big deal, but I'd much rather be able to secure it to prevent strangers from messing with it.<br /><br />Only two stars because of the serious lack of apps right now and limited functionality with casting really limits it usefulness to me.  With Flex I have been able to cast anything I've tried so far but it can be choppy and is less than ideal.  I generally really like google products and I'm optimistic this will improve further with time.  As more apps become available and if casting becomes more robust I may upgrade my rating
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|totally didn't expect this game to be that great..but it was a really great game. loved the story and length. puzzles were good too and I like the way the hints were set up. very well priced for these type games. great job with this one!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Well written book. Strange, ,not quite what I expected, but, I enjoyed it. It was a fast read for me.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book can make a big impact on your life if you believe in life after death.  If you don't, maybe it will nudge you in the right direction.  Many people have had similar experiences to the author's if you look into near death experiences in general.  Being in the medical field, I know that the illness that almost killed the author was one that required a miracle for him to have survived.  I believe he was compelled to write this book in order to give hope to others.  It did for me.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Gillian Flynn is my absolute favorite murder mystery writer! I had first gotten my hand  on this book from a library in 2009 when they were giving  away free books that had not been checked  out frequently. I thought since  it was free, it was going to be your average mediocre murder mystery. Boy was I wrong! It had  me hooked right away! The way she writes and her gripping story.... wow! I read the entire thing in a day.  I cannot wait until she writes a fourth book!
1593080409|5.0|IF YOU'RE A CONAN DOYLE FAN, THIS IS FOR YOU!  IT WILL BE READ FOR YEARS AND YEARS TO COME!
B004NS710C|5.0|Love love love this movie. I was on the edge of my seat more than a few times with the suspense.
B002TXZRRM|1.0|It was the most boring book that I have read author just waffled on I even missed chapters would not recommend it
1250029465|5.0|A great story about the redemptive and healing powers of pets.  You wont look at your cat the same way again.  Rock on, Bob.
B0036TGT2A|5.0|Everyone knows the story and I am sure most people who are purchasing this have already seen the movie so I won't be discussing the movie.  What I will be discussing is the 3D conversion.<br /><br />First of all, the 3D version is kid approved.  My little ones both enjoyed the 3D experience.  As far as the picture quality goes, I was very impressed.  I would give the picture quality a B+ to A-.  The 3D was very nice and dimensional and in my opinion added to the movie.  There were a few instances where, there was lots of motion on the screen and in those couple of instances, the 3D was distracting.  The colors were vibrant and and the picture was very clean.<br /><br />I already own the Little Mermaid on DVD so the 3D version was the enticement I needed to buy it on blue ray.
B000YQAMZI|1.0|I never got to see the film as the version sent to me unplayable in US. This is the second time this vendor has offered and sent this type film to me. First one was my error, said in big letters Region 2 and I didn't know what that meant. This one gave me no clue won't work in US until I put it in my DVD player!
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|this is another book on the laws of attraction its good book for beginners I felt that the author used too many other peoples writings and references I was also lost wind author  went into too many scientific explanations.  I enjoyed when the author used her own life experiences in the book  but was sometimes confused whether she was a man or woman in her references.  the experiments for fun and it is good starter buck
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The Language of Flowers is the best story I've read this year!  Don't miss this great story and memorable characters!
B003XT60KO|5.0|Relevant. Cuts through the complexity our media wraps around economic concepts making the subject immediately understandable by all.  Most of us become overwhelmed by buzz words like, sequestration, quantitative easing, debt ceiling etc.. If you want to replace the confusion those words and rhetoric are designed to cause with an understanding of how your productive work creates wealth (as opposed to money), read the book.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|The ocean at the end of the lane is at once delightful and intriguing. It's unique storyline entices and begs for more. GAIMAN S stories are always unique. I never know what will  come next. This story is no different and compelled me to see the world differently. The ocean itself is a wonderful mystery. I just wish there were more. I didn't want the story to end.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|More true to the JD comics than that crap from stallone years ago. Loved this movie. It is rough, but so is Dredds world. Great show!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Yes, the story is sad and you may shed some tears. However, it is beautifully written and the use of death as the narrator is captivating and pure genius. The prologue itself hooked me and I stayed invested all the way through.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love this game.  I play on my Kindle Fire and have had no problems.  I like the way the completed puzzle fits into a scenic picture.
B00CATONCA|5.0|This is everything I thought it would be. I have it sitting on a shelf right next to my tv. The heads look really creepy when lit. We love it!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|An enjoyable game. Great way to spend some time. Love playing it! Can be a bit addictive lol. Love the graphics as well. Overall a fun experience
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|A+. A must for any Star Trek fan. looking forward to the next installment.<br />A must see.Cast was as good.Story great.
B006X9EUUS|5.0|Listening to Sinead over the years, she is always able to deliver a consistently beautiful voice and wonderfully written songs. It's just very pleasurable to listen to, highly recommended.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Amazing book, I didn't want it to end! I can't wait to see who will play these amazing characters in the movie!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love love love this game!!I don't like how you have to get Rarity and Sweetybelle to finish the game and they both cost gems though. Other than that this game is great
0399226907|5.0|My boys love reading this book with me and I love that I can share something that I enjoyed as a kid.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|Amazing gift for my best friend, we both love legos and back to the future.  Its awesome quality and it was on amazon the day it came out, amazon and lego rock!
B0054XOMX4|5.0|This blade is too powerful...I just have to keep it!!  Its performance tip is really flat, so it's a really good stamina type.  The only bad thing about it is sometimes its performance tip stops spinning barely but the blade keeps spinning.  However, this does not stop the blade from winning.
0486290492|5.0|I'm really happy that I finally bought the book because the DVD does not cover so many characters who would have turned the DVD into a Series.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|The bag is a medium size and works great with enough pockets to pack everything I have and some room to spare. Three lenses cleaning supplies batteries etc...
B00005N6KG|4.0|I keep a pair in my car all the time.<br />You can hardly tell they are on you head.<br />Stay in your ears nicely as well.<br />I've usually had better than expected performance from Sony products like this.
0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay (The Final Book of The Hunger Games)<br />Suzanne Collins<br />thank for the book and for the quick delivery!! love it
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The best part of this to me was that they husband's secret was not the obvious one that I thought it would be.  I seriously could not wait to find out what it was and loved how everything tied together.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|I really, really enjoyed the broken timeline style of story telling. Absolutely hilarious, good characters, fun story line, evil villain, creative magic system. What more could you want in a quality fantasy book?
B006OCM0G0|4.0|This is a really fun game. Don't get me wrong but it is kinda frustrating when you really want something and it costs like 50 gems. Gems cost actual money and are expensive, over all this game is pretty good for being 99¢
B00F1RR3Y8|4.0|It was ok for a kids game. My step daughter really likes games like this so she was really excited about it
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham at his best. As usual, could not put it down til the last page. I need another Grisham like this!
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I highly recommend this book.  I travel a lot and look for books like this.  Wonderful.  I can't wait to read his next book.  This is the first book I have read by Mr. Rollins.
B00821OX98|4.0|Lots of action and Sfi-fi stuff.  Maybe a little social/ political statements if you want to find them. Or maybe not.
B003G4W49C|4.0|This was a well written book, rich with pro's that is an insightful look into humanity and the lack there of...
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I liked that it was less &#34;legal&#34; and more clever.  It kept me wondering right up til the end of the book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Im not a reader but enjoyed all three books. They held my interest right to the end. Wishing there was more.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|True gentlemen and a clearer understanding of heroism. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a better understanding of why you support the soldier even if you don't agree with the war.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|The characters are excellent, the story unpredictable and surprising.  Sometimes confusing due to somewhat similar names. No one lives happily ever after, or should I say no one lives.
B000U6BT40|5.0|It was a fun season to watch.  I watched it several years ago & was happy to find Eureka again.  Loved all old & new characters.
0786958731|5.0|Fantastic game, if nothing else than for the miniatures contained within that you cannot get anywhere else (Jarlaxle, Cattie-Brie, Regis, etc.).  Great game to play with friends
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Besides learning so much about flowers and their meanings , this was a well written story about love, family, choices, and relationships. About an orphan who has a hard time feeling comfortable with people.
B001P5M7QE|5.0|Having a bad day? Just not laughing enough? My go to for a great laugh. You can never go wrong. But it does make you want to buy some coconuts and go on an adventure!
B007THA4FI|5.0|A whole village full of disfunctional people, and they are all adults. The children of these adults show just what can happen when their par nets do not pay attention.<br />This is a good. Read with a lot of characters involved.
B00571F26Y|3.0|The entire book, minus the appendix could have been about 20 pages long. The rest is rinse and repeat over and over. I learned a couple of new things about the science of digestion though which made the book worth reading. The menu appendix is also interesting and useful. I think I will be able to get a few wheat free interesting recipes out of it.
B000GOWNPU|1.0|Hopefully, such acts are not visited on children in the US juvenile system today. This was sick and very very sad.
B00CATONCA|5.0|I have always been a huge fan of the show so when they started coming out with the Limited Editions for the different seasons Blu-Ray sets I was stoked.<br />The 2nd season Head Blu-Ray case is awesome so I never though that they would top it. Well, They did. The Governor's Fish tank set is just AWESOME!!!<br />IT IS VERY WELL BUILT AND DETAILED TO THE MAX!!<br />I couldn't believe how detailed the floating heads would be not to mention that it actually holds water and is lit up so you can admire it at night while watching your favorite show in True High Quality picture and sound.<br />I don't know what they have in mind for the Season 4 L.E. set but they really outdid themselves with Season 2 and Season 3s set.<br />I just wish that they would have made something better for Season 1s set besides a mask. I just bought the regular Blu-Ray set for Season 1.<br />I can't wait until October 13th 2013. I will be celebrating my birthday watching the 1st episode of Season 4 that night.<br />Thank you for creating the most interesting, awesome Season 3 set.<br />I believe it is worth every penny spent.<br />I have a BITCHIN set to display with my Zombie Head that are both great conversation starters.<br />If you haven't bought this Bad Boy yet I suggest that you do before they are sold out and then you will have to pay 2x-3x the price on Ebay to get it and fill somebody else's pockets with some extra cash.<br />I do have a 2nd Fish tank set just to hold onto just because. I want this Bad Boy to last a lifetime. ;-)&#62;
B008Y212PI|4.0|This game is a really fun game. It is addicting. I think it is fun and boring. It is so boring and not very fun. It is addicting.
B00B0CU2CI|4.0|If one believes that our lives are determined by our choices , this novel is the perfect illustration for this belief .<br />Sometime ,as in this case , a parent's mistake ruins his children's lives as well . And ,as in real life ,there isn't much these children can do to repair the damage .
B00BNWWUDY|5.0|i haven't watched the whole movie yet but so far everything is all good with the disc thank you again for sending this out so fast i'll be looking for more to buy real soon thanks.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|Does the job I bought it for. Not bling just works fine.i would recommend this product to others for their L<br />Kindle Fire.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|The movie covered all the essential parts of the book but lacked the book intensity.  I enjoyed the movie but it was not as good as the book.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|I will add this to my video library at home so I can watch it again and again and show it to friends and family as well.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|The movie follows the tradition of a story line full of action, adventure and humanity that has been a trademark from the beginning...
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|Do you wanna know why Madonna is Madonna? check out this concert and discover an amazing trip from darkness to light. Full of colours, great sound and edition. Check it out now!
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|i just the movie today and it plays very good thank you so much.i will look for more stuff from you in the near future
B006LSZECO|5.0|This novel is full of twists and turns.  I won't talk about the plot because there is tons of that information out there.  I'll just say that I loved it, that it made its own sense, and that the ending was perfect!
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Great app. My son loves memo so he keeps on playing and decorating. Keeps him occupied for me to do my work.
B000HAB4KS|4.0|I have these movies in my library...not quite my type of movie but enjoyed it...graphics good...not much I can say.
B00D5XYY4M|5.0|This app is perfect for those that cannot grasp the ideas of ISO, aperture, etc without being able to see it and  play around with features quickly while you read. I've read books, experimented but this app is just covering the basics but thoroughly.
B006XF5BTG|1.0|I do not need 20 words, and do not want to waste even that.<br />this book is a tired rehash, (and not a good one of Joe Weiders methods.<br />It is obvious that the intention is not to help,but to peddle the very products<br />which matthews decries. This charleton could be sued my all reputable body builders.<br />His book is also disjointed and has bad links and links only to other spam generators
B004YM6JP0|5.0|and i had watched a couple of the disec so far and everything is all good i will be buying more from you in the near future thanks alot so much
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's pretty good but when u start out it goes pretty slow. It's also good for kindle fires. Love it( sort of) still pretty good:-)
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|i think this game is awsome.usually i wouldn't use the word awsome.except for in this case.this game may not be so sefisticated.but its still an awsome game.
B005BZQVJ8|3.0|Was funny but language was a little excessive...not familar with these actors...not video library worthy....nothing else to say for this movie.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Fringe is a good sci-fi show. TV producers have skimped on this genre for the past several years, and I have missed being able to watch a contemporary sc-fi program. There's only so many times I can handle watching Whorf's bat'leth tournaments! I wasn't keeping up with the episodes on network TV and started watching them on Amazon. I didn't know what I'd been missing!<br />I didn't want to miss a beat. The graphics are really amazing, Plotlines are interesting. However, it is not original at all (although hardly anything is nowadays), and the acting isn't the best either. It seems much like a cross between X-Files and The Outer Limits. If you enjoyed those shows, you'll like Fringe. Overall, I rate it a very respectable 7 out of 10.
B00F7YHDWC|1.0|I refuse to give any paid app more than one star that contains adds. At the end of the day what the heck are you paying for? The privilege of having annoying pop up adds? Really?
B004JN1D2I|5.0|George RR Martin's Masterpiece is as well written as &#34;Dune&#34; and as engaging as The Lord of the Rings Series.  This series has everything, Engaging Characters, an Expansive Universe, Twists and Suprises in every book, and most importantly climactic battles against imperfect and identifiable sides.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Cannot believe show cancelled.  Music, dancing, great acting, good guests and an interesting storyline.  I could watch over and over just to hear the songs and watch the performers.
B00DJYKFXG|2.0|Im a huge fan of The Band and I was waiting for this thing...so.. With a bit of hesitation I splurged on the $100 box set instead of just the Audio CD...I wanted that Video footage!<br /><br />DONT DO IT..there is no video..its just photos in a slide show..<br /><br />The packaging is misleading to say the least. just buy the $19.00 one.<br /><br />anyone want to form a class action lawsuit on grounds of false advertising and misrepresentation?
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Great movie...great moral...Bullock is good in anything she does...I liked the other actors as well.....no more I can say for this movie.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Amazing book, so descriptive. I felt like I was there. I'm already on the fourth installment as I need to know what happens to everyone.
140006922X|5.0|I though this was a very interesting and informative book and add to my knowledge of Jesus the person and his idea of how we should live separate from the other stuff that was added later about him
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I think its logical and biblical, you can definitely be confronted by the word of God. It's simple and precise.
B009AP2G26|5.0|I would give Glee 10 stars if allowed.  This show is an upper.  Fabulous talent, each week surpassing the last.  Storyline, great acting, and the best dancing to terrific songs you will ever see or hear!  There is something here for everyone, anything goes, and somehow everyone fits together.  Joyous, hopeful and fearless!
B002KCO6QA|4.0|Really looking forward to seeing this except for the fact that the copy I received was set for  a different region.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|Bought bling for my son. Afterwards the game froze up. When it finally opened again half the bling we purchased was gone, all game progress for the day was gone also. The friends list never works to get hearts. Sent email to the so called customer service team and over a week later still nothing is solved.  I even called them and was told I would receive a solution by email the next morning ( said they would comp some how) 24 hours later and still nothing. Sent another email tonight and told them I wanted a refund. Will let everyone know what they do next. Stay away from the game and anything else from them. Spend your money on Dr Panda apps for the kids. They work, never freeze and the kids loves them.
B00915G6MG|5.0|It is great! I really like this season it meets all my expectations. I'm really happy with it and will get the next season as well
B004AWAC5W|5.0|Their best album. A true classic. This remastered edition sounds much better than the original CD. You should buy it today!
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|Downloaded this game for something to do and was pleasantly surprised.  The pictures and words can be very easy to somewhat difficult.
B0093FNZT6|4.0|I found this book to be believable and highly thought provoking.  The author's background in neurosurgery makes him a credible witness to the events that unfolded. I enjoyed the way he weaved the story of his life into his overall NDE experience giving me a complete understanding of his point of view.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is so awesome that my brother and I cant stop playing it me and my brother bulild awesome city's .
B0077EBWVI|4.0|Good movie for a remake, nice drama, dancing and even though not the original it was still pretty good! Rent!
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Glen Hansard is one of the musical gems of the last couple of generations.  Whether it is the plaintive sounds of loss and yearning or just driving rock and roll, it's something special.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Very interesting take on the zombie genre.  The story was a little too simple,  especially considering the depth available in the novel (which this movie is completely different from).  On the whole a very enjoyable movie to rent.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|This is one of those books that makes you both love and hate the main character and then want to be like her. It melds science fiction with the wild wild west with political turmoil; frustrates and peaks the imagination. It is definitely a good read and will make you think about our own world and how the rich and the poor are so disparate.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I had never read this book growing up so as an adult I decided it was high time I did. I am so glad I have! What a good sensible book with so many day to day trials that nearly everyone should find relevance to their own lives. As a mother of 5 with 3 girls myself I love to see how each girl with their own personalities bloomed in their own time. Mrs. March was such a great model of mothering that I pray I may handle my girls in such away that when I am 60 they will all feel the love for me which the March girls felt toward their Marmee.
B003SPCYP8|5.0|This film delivers a wake-up call to Americans about the hazards of  identifying all members of a specific religious/ethnic group as dangerous to humanity. The  craft of the story is how it builds its reality through the eyes of a very young boy whose  brilliant mind has no means of emotionally relating to the people and events around him. &#34; High functioning Asberger Syndrome&#34; is how he introduces himself to a group of strangers. He wants to learn how to feel like he belongs but somebody has to help him understand the emotional content of language in very logical and specific terms so he can practice recognizing the emotion behind the words. His need to understand how to be one of the good people makes him do what we normal people would judge to be very brave and dangerous tasks. This is a unique film, beyond the requirements of entertainment. It is an opportunity to restore a feeling of our individual humanity.
B00BVYVV5C|5.0|When I first saw this show it was the finale of season three. I liked it so much I watched all the episodes from the beginning. The show is a mixture of drama and comedy. I almost laughed myself to tears watching this season. The guidance counselor is hilarious. Sadie is the quintessential mean girl, but I can see how she has issues with her body with makes her tease others to boost her self-esteem. I can't help but feel a little sorry for her, not that much. All in all Awkward is a good show, I would recommend this to a friend.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Nice game. Kinda like a simplified magic type game. Simple but does require some thought. I'm enjoying it. No problems on my KH 8.9<br />Update 10/10. I am really enjoying this game. I play every night. Some of the challenges do require some thinking and I've had to do a couple 4-5 before I could manage to beat other monster. I also love pillaging. You do not have to use your own $, you can play your way up. I'm 33yo and this is my new favorite. Very happy!
034580404X|5.0|Bought these as a gift and they arrived as described and she was very very happy.. Thank you so much!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book pulls you in from the beginning and doesn't let you go.  I expected to enjoy this, but I was more than impressed by how I couldn't put it down!
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|I use it a lot  Helps when I need to refine my wording when I am reading or writing something.
B005K17RU0|2.0|Widget will not locate places on my phone. Not too impressed. If it would work properly I would recommend to other people.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it and it is a awesome and cool I also like the place and villains.I hope that you come up with a 2,3,4and infinity game were you have to run as long as you can
B006CHML4I|5.0|After running the tempral gamut of Ironman timepieces from my track and field days, I decided it was time for a cleaner, analog look without the need to replace it every year or so. After some research, I landed on Seiko. I've worn the watch five days a week or more for a while now, so I think it's safe to say I found a keeper.<br /><br />The timepiece itself looks almost nautical in navy and silver with a stopwatch style second hand and glow in the dark face. I have made use of both features over the course of my ownership, but the one perk I find most useful is the day/date set up at the 3 o' clock position. Call me old fashioned, but I prefer not having to rely on my cell phone to tell date and time. Old habits and all that. The see-through back is another cool feature, despite the fact that you rarely see it.<br /><br />After years of rubber straps, I think I now definitely prefer the canvas. It breathes better, is more malleable, and doesn't chafe nearly as much against my skin after sweating through it. All in all, it's a comfortable wear.<br /><br />One special note should be mentioned for its durability. I'm a bit clumsy. Most of my watches have been banged into counters, scraped against walls, and submerged in water over the course of a day at work. I am pleased to report that, despite all of these things having been done to this watch, it survives unblemished. I expect I'll have this thing for quite a while, especially since it winds itself.<br /><br />If you're looking for a simple, but elegant looking watch for everyday use, this one comes highly recommended.
B004JZBGWI|1.0|Did not like this app at all. I found it hard to enter an event on the calendar.  After 5min I just deleted.
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|This is not my favorite Miyazaki movie but it didn't disappoint me either.. I love the development of the relationship between the main characters and once again that wonderful animation typical of Hayao Miyazaki. One more for my personal collection.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Having worked in a prison for women, this book captures the language and culture completely. I laughed and cried at Piper's descriptions. The bigger question begs for solutions other than the power and control model of holding people.<br />Joan Leaman LCSW, LADC
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Cant wait for the movie to come out!<br />Very entertaining!!!<br />Look forward to seeing this on the big screen for sure!!
B0098460O4|5.0|This is an amazing disc, worth each cent of my money, I was shocked for the quality and the great voices. I strongly recommend this disc. You will enjoy and be delightful with each song. The best album I ever bought
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I love using my Kindle to find books that I may have not found or read otherwise. This book was one that I randomly found and bought because of the low price. I had a hard time putting this book down and read it all in one weekend. Amazing and heartbreaking all at the same time! I am definitely planning on reading more by this author in the future.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Jillian Michael's DVD fits the bill. Gives you a tough workout in a short period of time. Intervals are short so you are able to power through relying on the thought that it's only two minutes or thirty seconds, whatever the case may be. I already feel like I'm in better shape.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|I dont know what they were trying to pull off, but they didn't. This movie could have been so much better, but they just went to deep into the character development, and not deep enough into the plot. I certainly is not worth 5 bucks to rent. I would wait, had i only known.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is a rare one in that it stays true to its roots and follows the book very closely.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|~Spoiler Alert~<br /><br />A nice feel good Stephen King novel.<br /><br />This is more of a sci fi novel than a horror in my mind (though parts were horrific), with emphasis on psychic abilities.  Maybe, I should not have been, but I was very pleasantly surprised at how good this novel was. I was expecting something entirely different, more along the lines of \\"The Shining\\". As a sequel, it works, and there are many references to \\"The Shining\\", but the newer novel is clearly one of S.K's later work, and that shows, not just in the use of cell phones and such, but in his overall style. It lacks some of the descriptiveness of his earlier works (which I imagine some might call wordy).<br /><br />There were many references, many subtle to other of his works. The whole crew in their RVs with their special powers brought to my  mind \\"The Regulators\\" and also \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\", and \\"Insomnia\\". Recurrent themes there and I was happy to see some explored so fully.  The character of Danny was fabulous and really made the novel. And there is always a familiar feel in the surrounding cast of characters...Billy, Casey, the doctor...good people. I enjoyed the ending (not the after ending, but the actual ending), and felt it was much more satisfactory than than found in some of Stephen King's later works. I still wish though that the ending was more ambiguous. It seemed almost cheap, especially when compared to a novel like \\"Salem's lot\\". I guess there is still Evil and evil out there and the author doesn't need to point this out.<br /><br />I also love Stephen King's use of parenthesis....And it is a feel good story because none of the good guys end up dead and the bad guys get their asses handed to them.
B008Y212PI|5.0|It's a great game that challenges your mind. It has several games within each picture. I really enjoy playing it.

B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|I did not find any new information that was not already available in other texts.  The style of writing made it more interesting, but the content was not particularly revelatory.  This text is good for those who have not delved into this information previously.  The author has summed up some of the available material in a comprehensive and somewhat objective manner.

You will not ever have buyer's remorse, I promise you!

B00D82BNLC|5.0|Leigh MacLeod's life goes from difficult to impossible as she loses her husband to cancer and has to take care of her young son all by herself. Financially strapped and emotionally drained, Leigh feels there is nothing left to look forward to in her life. And it is at that moment that she is given an opportunity to join a paranormal investigation group.<br /><br />And suddenly, things become very interesting, when Leigh and her team get a chance to investigate Greenhurst, an abandoned  hospital. Leigh's team is hard-working and successful. A little bit of luck, such as lottery winnings that could be used to upgrade the equipment and hire highly-qualified team members, doesn't hurt either. Leigh's life goes through ups and downs, financially and health-wise. Her team's success with the investigations also varies. And success, when dealing with wandering and unsettled spirits, is not always a good thing. And that's what Leigh quickly learns as unexpected and scary events happen during the Greenhurst investigation.<br /><br />The story is engaging and interesting, and not just because of the topic. It also draws the readers in because it is told from the first person point of view that makes it easier to relate to the main character. Just like Leigh and her team, the story quickly moves from Canada to the neon lights of Las Vegas to moonlit Nevada desert and to California. And on this journey, Leigh finds consolation, friends, success, and love. If you have an interest in the paranormal and like a good story, this book is for you.

140191716X|5.0|It is really helpful. Definitely, it met my expectations. It is the third one I bought, I gave it as a gift to a friend and to my daughter
1935597760|3.0|By about a third of the way through this book, I would have rated it with 5 stars.  I liked the portrayal of Jamie and Lydia--Jamie, who had suffered so much as a child yet developed a good heart.  His loneliness and lack of direction was well portrayed. And Lydia, who is the daughter of domineering parents, a woman who makes it a practice to do what is expected of her.  She lives a tamped down, repressed life and longs to break free from that.  I thought the book was going in the direction of these two people meeting, falling in love and having to work through their difficulties to live together as a couple.  That is the story I wanted to read. Unfortunately, it takes a long time for Jamie and Lydia to actually meet and by then the author seemed to desire to turn the story into a folksy comedy. Jamie is revealed to be a man who is so backward that the reader begins to realize that a romance with anyone is really out of the question.  Also, Lydia's encounter with the older man in the hotel was so over the top that it was not believable--again the novel left it's thoughtful tone and delved into slapstick humor. Also, Lydia's personality totally changes when her mother takes ill.  Suddenly she is a daughter who will not leave her mother's side and forgets all her desire for her own life. I actually liked the ending, because I had long since given up on the story being about the thoughtful romance of two very different and damaged people, yet I cared for Jamie and Lydia and was happy that they were still going to be together.

B0007LXPBI|5.0|Growing up, this was my favorite movie.  My mother's generation had the version that came out in the 1960s with Hayley Mills.  And my generation had this version--an updated, poignantly funny rendition of a masterpiece.  Two little girls go to camp together--and find out that they're twins! :-)  Once they make this amazing discovery, they decide to switch places, and see if they can bring their parents back together.  The ending is heartwarming.  You should definitely watch, especially if you like funny love stories and a happy ending! I highly recommend this movie.  :-)

B007TK77QE|5.0|A lot of people expected a murder mystery novel. It isn't one. I'm not a fan of J.K. Rowling and her Harry Potter series. I read only the first four books and I was not thrilled. But this one was just the opposite.<br />The Casual Vacancy is about life not about some magic stuff. It's about unhappy marriages, failed relationships, dysfunctional families ... The characters are vital and I love how she describes them and how she constructs the story around the personalities and the lives of multiple people. I wished that at the end all would be right but J.K. Rowling apparently decided not to be. Just like real life.

B00AESN8XY|5.0|I used to not really buy things from Amazon, but one day my brother purchased the game, played it, and let me have a try, and I had decided to buy it. I'm very glad I did! This app is amazing! I love it! don't really care that you're trying to wipe out all of humanity with a disease, because, honestly, I love being a serial killer in this game! I really want to get more genes to help me!!! Although, if you want a quick game, this isn't it. It takes about an hour to do everything. I still love it! I got 10% genes discovered already(and counting!!!!!)! This app was completely worth the $10.00(oh, what? It's only $1.00? Still worth it!) You should buy this game. Don't let others fool you. It's good for any age-surprise! I'm 13 and Iove it!

B00000F566|4.0|I did enjoy the video and the extra features.  I, however, was disappointed that there were some missing scenes in this version; especially those featuring Lisa, Baby's sister.  I originally had purchased the VCR edition several years ago and it does include these scenes.  Is there a truly \\"uncut\\" version of this classic available?  If so, where may I purchase it?

B005LAIIGW|5.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Very few American films today classified as 'entertainment', actually can rise to the level of Art. 'Gravity', the new sci-fi, 'Space Odyssey-like' thriller, starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, I'm happy to report, has made it into that pantheon. You would never imagine that a film that only features two actors, can be so compelling and captivating; but coupled with a barrage of extraordinary digital effects, co-writer and director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, has pulled it off!<br /><br />The story begins with Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock), a bio-medical engineer and veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (Clooney), on a spacewalk outside their space shuttle, conducting routine experiments, when they're alerted by Mission Control in Houston that a Russian satellite has exploded and the debris field is headed straight for the shuttle (inciting incident). In a spectacular sequence, the shuttle is destroyed and Stone is hurled around in space still tethered to the craft, bouncing on and off of it, like a ping pong ball. When she's finally separated from the craft, Kowalski, utilizing his thruster pack to maneuver, saves her from floating out into space and they make their way back to the space shuttle, which they discover has been destroyed and the rest of the crew members dead (one of the astronauts who had been outside the craft, has his face blown off).<br /><br />As we break into Act II, Stone and Kowalski must make their way to the International Space Station (ISS), if they have any chance of survival. The 'ticking time clock', so inimical to thrillers, is used to great effect throughout the film. Kowalski sets his watch for 90 minutes, because that's when the debris field, will make its first orbit around the earth, and come back and possible hit them again. While floating toward the ISS, we learn of Stone's back story (her daughter was tragically killed in a schoolyard accident and she then decided to devote her life to her work). Using the thruster, Stone and Kowalski arrive at the ISS, only to find the stakes are raised again, as the ISS crew has abandoned ship and the Russian Soyuz space module has been damaged, useless for re-entry to earth. Even more thrilling and shattering is that Stone finds herself tangled in the already deployed parachute from the module and is holding on to Kowalski, whose weight is causing the parachute cords to break.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, 'Gravity' avoids Hollywood endings by realistically arguing that space exploration is a danger business--and may result in death. Stone finds herself alone after Kowalski 'cuts himself loose' and we approach the 'dark moment' of the second Act, as Stone must maneuver the damaged module to a Chinese space station, Tiangong. But when she discovers that the module has no more fuel, it appears there's no hope. Stone's hopelessness is highlighted when she reaches a farmer on a short wave frequency, who doesn't speak English. The dark moment of the second act, always results in the protagonist discovering a solution to the problem; that happens during her hallucination that Kowalski has returned to help her, advising that she can still use the re-entry rockets to move the craft.<br /><br />Now the protagonist must implement the 'solution' as we head toward the climax in Act III. There's more spectacular, edge of your seat machinations, when Stone uses a fire extinguisher as a makeshift thruster, to get herself over and into the Tiangong. I won't go into the rest of it, except to say that Stone must not only get herself out of a real pickle during the fiery re-entry to earth, but must solve a new crisis, after splashing down into a body of water, in a remote section on earth.<br /><br />While I've been hard on Sandra Bullock, especially for her recent lame performance in 'The Heat', here she proves (when given the right material) that she's as good as any of the top stars out there today. It's an extraordinarily nuanced, low key performance, coupled with some physically demanding stunts, which I suspect were not all dependent on digital effects. Do you hear 'Oscar' calling? Clooney too is masterful, as he also delivers just the right kind of restrained performance to make this whole thing believable.<br /><br />Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n has admitted that not everything we see on screen is physically or scientifically possible. But so what! Much of the technical aspect is true to form and looks quite believable. 'Gravity' is much more than a spectacular visual feast--it's about a struggle against overwhelming odds. When Bullock (Stone) emerges from a watery tomb, after 'going it alone', a la 'Robinson Crusoe', there is the sense that we've just witnessed an awe-inspiring, story of survival and an uplifting paean, to the human spirit.low key performance, coupled with some physically demanding stunts, which I suspect were not all dependent on digital effects.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|\\"Doctor Sleep\\" is not \\"The Shining\\". There, I said it. And it's true.<br /><br />But as other (and better) reviewers have said, it doesn't matter. For those of us who remember when Stephen King first hit the scene, we know what this is all about. Because we're all doing it, right?<br /><br />Revisiting the successes and failures of our younger days, and trying to put paid to them in some way.<br /><br />That's what \\"Doctor Sleep\\" feels like to me. Imagine, Mr. King has basically revisited HIMSELF 30 years ago, not just a character in one of his books. He's walked over the grounds of the Overlook Hotel again, and sees everyone and everything there with the eyes of a man who knows he's closer to the end than the beginning -<br /><br />AND THAT'S JUST FINE!<br /><br />So thank you, Mr. King, for letting us walk this ground with you again. And now that you've said goodbye to Dan Torrance - how about letting us know how Charlie McGee is doing these days?
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|I loved this game! The graphics were great, puzzles clever, storyline was straightforward and a nice change of pace from the &quot;so you wake up from a car accident&quot; games. This game also has a hint feature that needs no recharging and has no limit, and works for actions and puzzles. I had no issues with errors as a couple others did.  I highly recommend this game to those who are looking for a point-and-click with no frustrations and relaxing pace.
1476727651|2.0|Back in the late 1970s I read my first King novel, \\"The Shining\\". It was absolutely fabulous; I read the entire book in one sitting, on a dark and stormy night (literally!). It scared the bejesus out of me. I loved it!<br /><br />Back in those days he was in top form, and came out with a panoply of excellent books. \\"It\\", \\"The Stand\\", \\"Salem's Lot\\", \\"Dead Zone\\", \\"The Tommyknockers\\", etc.<br /><br />But as time went on, the scary fire in his novels started to dim, especially as he started into the non-horror efforts. I felt his works were becoming more hit and miss, and the level of horror and fright factor seemed to be fading. They often lost focus, or became meandering and tedious. Not always, but more and more often. I started skipping some of them altogether.<br /><br />When I read that this book was coming out and that it was a sequel to one of my absolute favorites, \\"The Shining\\", I couldn't wait to get my hands on it and pre-ordered it (from the competition, I have to admit).<br /><br />Well... this book just goes to show that some things should be simply left where they were.<br /><br />The end of \\"The Shining\\" left us with an image of the young boy and his mother having barely survived the catastrophe at the Overlook, and young Dan and his mentor in the skill of shining - Dick Hallorann - having established a lasting relationship that one simply knows will go on forever.<br /><br />Only to find out in this book that Dan turned into a drunk and a lout, and his mother slid into a low-rent life of self-pity.<br /><br />Okay, that's not good, but that doesn't prevent the book from building from that basis into something taking the essential elements of \\"The Shining\\" and incorporating them into the current story. I can see where that may have led to a fascinating sequel in itself. A story of salvation and rehabilitation. Which King actually attempts here, I think.<br /><br />Problem is, this book just doesn't have the necessary elements to carry it off.<br /><br />First of all, if I hear one more thing about Alcoholics Anonymous any time within the next week, I'm just gonna barf. Enough, already! Dan's a drunk. Got it. MOVE ON.<br /><br />King mentions in his Afterword that he was a boozer. Thanks for sharing. I'm glad AA worked for you. That doesn't mean the rest of us want to be bored to tears with an almost endless recitation of AA trivia and dogma.<br /><br />Worse yet, the horror aspects aren't really ... well... horrifying. It seemed like he was trying to recapture certain plot stylings of \\"The Stand\\", what with cross-country nemeses being psychically aware of each other and ultimately crossing the country for a final confrontation. But boy, it simply does NOT work in this book.<br /><br />What did work were the parts that focused on the young girl protagonist Abra, a fascinating character. But protagonist Dan was, once again, needlessly and unfortunately diluted by all the AlAnon preachifying, to the point that it was way past annoying. And more unfortunately, the antagonists, the True Knot, were simply... pedestrian. Easily killed, it turns out. Where was the sense of impending doom, the sense of almost invincible paranormal power that makes them memorable? Or at least formidable?<br /><br />Nowhere to be seen.<br /><br />For me, this was a vastly disappointing book. A very generous 2 stars.>First of all, if I hear one more thing about Alcoholics Anonymous any time within the next week, I'm just gonna barf. Enough, already! Dan's a drunk. Got it.

B009RX7WTI|5.0|It's always sad for me when I have to wait another solid year for the next full season to be released.  I do not watch any series on TV because I hate the commericials.  They breakup the story line.  This season had so many changes in it but really left me dangling as to there would be another season.  Some things ended complelely and others were left open for change.  Hope there is Season 10.  Can anyone tell me?
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is the first book I've read by this  author but it won't be the last! I loved the intertwined stories and the characters were so easy to relate to. I will recommend this book to everyone!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Began watching this and couldn't stop.  Well done series with really good character development.  It's based on a States attorney who accepts bribes, cheats on his wife and winds up in prison. His wife is an attorney who left her practice to rear two children and be a &#34;good wife&#34; through the years. With her husband in prison, she sells their large home and moves into an apartment with their two children. She must return to work and accepts a junior associate position  at a large Chicago law firm.  One of the partners in this firm is an old flame from law school and creates undercurrents throughout the series.  Very enjoyable, interesting series with lots going on to keep you watching.
B0000X61VE|5.0|It's a great workout with lots of good, basic old school lunges, weights and sit ups. No jumping. She does go too fast, especially for the warm up, but that's easy to adjust for yourself.
B008FWHGYS|4.0|This movie is on a deeper level then people can commit. If you really are thinking about life and where it can lead you then you need to see this movie. It gets you in that mood of thinking about life and the decisions we make. How hungry are you for living and making money and can money really buy happiness for most yes it can but for others well that is for you to determine.
B0087DFIYA|4.0|surprisingly good movie.  even the wife of the family  liked  it because of the redemptive nature of the story.  mel gibson was very good in this story and am glad that he is coming back with some good scripts after turmoil in his personal life.
B004A8ZX28|4.0|Liam Neeson, as Dr. Martin Harris, arrives in Berlin for a biotech conference, but as they arrive at the hotel he realizes that he has left his briefcase at the airport. On the way back to the airport, the taxi he is riding in is involved in an accident, and he ends up in the hospital in a coma for a few days. When Dr. Harris awakens, he has no identification and amnesia. He knows his name but not how or why he ended up where he is. As snippets of memory return, he tries to convince everyone around him that he is Dr. Martin Harris, though another man is now accompanying his wife and claiming to be Dr. Harris.<br /><br />Through some rather complex plot twists and turns, accompanied by car chases and violence, we eventually learn why another man is claiming to the Dr. Martin. I won't include any plot spoilers here, but the back story that is revealed is quite interesting, if not totally believable. Liam Neeson excels at this type of role- intense, complex and nuanced. The wrap-up was a bit far-fetched - why does he go full circle from being a bad guy to a good guy? It is never explained and rather improbable. Nevertheless, I was really immersed in the intensity of this thriller right up until the end.
B00EJYGQFG|2.0|I was expecting an full CD not just 1 song. Like the song but for $9 a song. (Way to much)
B00ECLU346|5.0|Of course it's redundant, of course it's childish and slapstick humor (for the most part), but what the hell did you expect?? It's hilarious, and a great ending to a \\"dumb and dumber who need AA\\" saga.
B00D2CYV9E|5.0|I grow up on Liberace and everyone knew he was gay, even as a pre-teenager. I got to see the other side of Liberace which made Liberace more interesting. Rob Lowe stole the show with his off beat character as the plastic surgeon. I've never seen him in a role like that as he usually plays in leading pretty boy roles. I wish that Liberace who have come out of the closet as he lay dying as did Rock Hudson toward the end of his life. Don't forget that this is a look at Liberace from a second person on drugs. What was the real Liberace like through other people who knew him? I didn't think Macheal Douglas could act until this role as Liberace and Rob Lowe as the plastic surgeon. I would like too see more !!!
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I have been playing G5 games for awhile.  This is one of the better ones.  It keeps me interested and I won't be able to finish it quickly.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|Got this for FAotD on my Kindle Fire HD7 and it works great!  I like that there's a story with the gameplay...it makes you want to stay with the game and find out what's next!  You are on travels and along the way you do a bejeweled-type puzzle to get through a pass or icy areas along your way. You gain different talismans to help you solve the puzzle more quickly.  If you run out of time you have to redo the puzzle. It's happened to me several times already and makes the game more interesting. It's not too hard or too easy.<br /><br />There are also picture puzzles to solve at intervals, which keeps the game from being just the same thing over and over.<br /><br />The music and artwork are nice and it's a peaceful game.<br /><br />The only thing I found odd is that I couldn't go back and play a level...my path has certain levels with stars. I assume that means I did well on them, but not so well on the pathpoints without stars? Anyway there doesn't seem to be a way to go back and redo those....not that it matters anyway...as long as my little guy got through he can continue on his journey :)
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Sensitive portrayal of a young boys death in a small community.  Extremely well acted.  A US version is in the making and I find it hard to believe they can outshine this production.<br />Wish they could use the same cast and continue on with other story lines.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I read all three, but it took me forever.  I finally finished the last book after shelving it for over 6 months.<br /><br />Way too much sex for my tastes in books and a bit predictable.
B009EANE3M|5.0|Great album. I am totally impress with The Scripts music. I would recommend this album to any music lover and enthusiast.
B001NB52PS|5.0|This is a rock with a cause classic.  It opened my eyes to world problems when I was a young adult.

B005LAIIGW|5.0|Every now and again, there comes a film that shakes things up. It is called ground breaking, monumental and the film that everyone should see. So what  film has the privilege of gaining such praise? Why that would be Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity. The man behind films like Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban and Children of Men not only helms Gravity, but he also produced and co-wrote this space thriller. When the movie made its way to Festival circuits, viewers were awed. For months now, Gravity has had nothing but praised from the likes of critics and filmmakers. That kind of one sided critiquing is something that catches my eye. So was Gravity truly a masterpiece? Masterpiece may not be the best term for this film; but more or less.<br /><br />The story of Gravity is quite simple. If you have seen the trailers or tv spots, then that's all you need to know about the plot. However, if you missed any of the film's advertisement, allow me to indulge you:  Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) finds herself in a heap of trouble after an accident above Earth's orbit leaves her stranded in space.<br /><br />With no build up, Gravity throws you right into the thick of things. In the first ten minutes, the satellite is destroyed and Sandra Bullock finds herself adrift in space. Normally, I would be bothered by such a thing; but in case of Gravity, it works. While I believe there are some themes in the film, they are used with a subtly and don't play a major role in the overall plot. When it comes down to it,  Gravity has a thrilling story from start to finish; and it certainly works in the film's favor.<br /><br />It's never easy to carry the stage by yourself, but Sandra Bullock showed that she can in this thriller. While this technically a two-man show, the perspective is center on Bullock's character and she does all the work. If Sandra is not at least nominated for Best Actress for the upcoming Oscars, I will be surprised. Why? Well it is one thing to play a strong character; it is another to play a strong character in a different environment, and that is exactly what Sandra Bullock does.  Don't worry, I'm not leaving out George Clooney. While I'm not biggest Clooney fan and I felt that George was being George, his role as Matt Kowalski was great for a supporting character. Still, at the end of the day, I have to take my hat off to Sandra Bullock.<br /><br />There is no other way to put this: Gravity has to be one the most technically sound films I have ever seen. Cuaron's use of camerawork was awe inspiring. Where we are so use to a clip to clip format in movies, Gravity used longer cuts and showed so much in each sequence. The first person shots were used so well, it could make a some First Person Shooters jealous. There was some Questionable CG, but it didn't hurt the overall film. What certainly help the film were the visuals. Gravity had some of the best shots of Earth I have ever seen captured on the silver screen.<br /><br />Then there is the film's 3D. Alright, I will be the first to admit that I'm not the biggest fan of 3D. If you can, i suggest seeing a movie in your standard 2D.  However, Gravity has my stamp of approval of being a must see  in 3D. The film used the effect to best of its abilites; from having things fly in your face to just seeing things stand out.  Gravity's 3D is worth every penny.<br /><br />If I had to pick which scene was my favorite, it would have to be the destruction of the space station. The sequence was thrilling and the both the camera and the 3D made the destruction of the ISS that more impressive. The only scene I thought was weak was when Ryan is speaking to the farmer. I found scene hard to follow; though I did understand why it was there.<br /><br />The title above says it all: Gravity is a definition of a movie experience. Sure the movie may not have the most solid of stories; but everything in this film works. This is a must see in theaters; and if you can, check it out in IMAX. My hat goes off to everyone apart of this project as Gravity is one best movie of the year.<br /><br />You can also see he review here: [...]
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I love this series and I never really cared for zombie movies.  I got the download so I could watch it on my iPad.  Can't wait for season 3!
B005K17RU0|1.0|This used to be my favorite weather app.  It worked great on my blackberry back in the day.  It was also pretty good when I first crossed over to Android.  Now it seems like every update slows it down.  I had been planning on purchasing the premium to get rid of the ads but if the fee one does not impress me I have no reason to think the paid version is better.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I have read this whole series and love the books! I am an avid fan of The White Queen, a series now showing on Saturday nights. Would love to see more on some of the other main characters.

B004DM1ZQY|5.0|I started playing backgammon in college nearly 40 years ago. In fact, I got pretty good; winning several championship tournaments. But, that, was a long time ago. I didn't remember how to play until I got this program for my kindle fire. I like it because it comes with different levels of play as well as instructions! I am now working my way up the levels and have begun sparring with the game's computer. I'm not ready for tournaments at the local assisted-living facility, yet!  But soon!!!!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Yeah. I know all of these words. So easy! Amazon, please make  a harder book for me to read. Daniel Lago.

Three weeks to deliver one CD ,ARE YOU KIDDING ?
0618680004|5.0|The book was a gift for my father, who thoroughly enjoys Richard Dawkins. I bought him this book for his birthday and he loved it! He and I are extremely happy with this purchase.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|George Martin is an exceptional storyteller who is incredibly detailed in describing all of the characters in the Game of Thrones. The ongoing and intertwining plots and sub-plots keeps the reader coming back for more
B000HF0ILY|5.0|If you haven't seen it, see it. If you have seen it watch it again. I love the old movies.
B000JMLFLW|3.0|The story moves you along at a very slow pace.  The characters have some interest.  I'd much rather read Georgette Heyer.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|It has made password management easy. I use it on all my devices and it works great. I would recommend it to a friend.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|this is the best app RPG made for any tablet,android,touch screen devise. there are so many countless hr of fun. ONLY ONE PROBLEM! !!!! fix this and I'll play nothing else......having to spend real cash to upgrade things,and needing to be online to do so as well. if thats fixed,then my 360 has become just a dvd player. so it gets a 4 star till i can upgrade without  online
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|The only reason this did not get five stars was the ending.  It was satisfying, but not mind blowing like the end of the Shining or It.  Definitely worth the read however and so, so entertaining!!
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|If you haven't seen it, see it. If you have seen it watch it again. I love the old movies.
B00633W614|5.0|This is a can't-put-down joy to read.  The characters are rich and well written.  Though they are out of my class, out of my known area, they were totally relatable.  The story brings you through history with not a trace of schoolroom feel.  Happily anticipating book 4.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My kids do most of the playing of games. But I have played this one a few times. The levels and sound affect are fun and addicting. It is a good way to pass some time.
B00594XOZU|1.0|The application doesn't work because it won't even let me log in and it should be reported for its bad service they need to make it work or I'm throwing my kindle away I have excellent wifi but kik is not working fix it now or u will lose all it consumers.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Best Star Trek film yet. Abrams crafts another great film featuring excellent performances all around. Particularly Cumberbatch and Quinto. The supporting cast fill out just great too.
B00F52YOPA|5.0|I love hidden object games.  This is probably one of the best yet.  You won't be disappointed. It's  a great game for Kindle Fire.
B002RKSZWG|4.0|It is a good read and has interesting characters.  It does drag in some spots, but mostly holds one's interest.
B008Y212PI|4.0|worth it to down load and play.  gives hours of challenging. puzzles.  hope you find it worth your space and time
B000UBMSB8|5.0|When shopping for Blade Runner I found several different versions.  I was unsure what to buy until I found this one with all the major version in one collection.  My wife and I watched the final directors cut and were very impressed with the quality of the video.  The story went smoothly, the special effects were great.  I think the real Los Angeles will be this bad, but without the off world colonies to escape to and without the flying cars!<br /><br />Mike Bunkermeister Creek
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Having just read 'The Shining' for the first time last year, I was thrilled a follow up came so soon thereafter.  I found myself so curious about how Danny would turn out after such a traumatic childhood event.  His struggles through adult life are not surprising.  What is surprising is the tale King weaves that manages to be frightening, enlightening, an frankly,quite a ride.  Though I shouldn't be surprised.  King is a master storyteller and I have yet to dislike any one of his many books.
B00846REIS|5.0|I have to say Sylvia you are the greatest writer I have ever seen. What ever you write turns to gold.
B000JQUMPI|2.0|Saccharine.  I read this as a kid and didn't like it.  I hoped that as an adult I would.  Not.
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|After awhile you get the hang of this game, and it can be engrossing if you are a perfectionist at heart.  If you are just trying to occupy some vacant time, it is a fun thing to fuss with.  Graphics are good.  Controls simple.  No stress generated by playing it.  There really isn't anything negative you can say about it.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|This movie came quickly and in great condition.<br />This is one of my all time favorite movies and it was forever before I decided to search for it.<br />I am so happy to have it in my collection.<br />Thank you

B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Shaun the sheep is hysterically funny.  My husband got my grandkids interested in this show.  They love it too and laugh a lot when watching it.
B002RKSZKI|4.0|It is a good read and has interesting characters.  It does drag in some spots, but mostly holds one's interest.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Really really good. Best John Puller adventure even better than Deception.  Love David Baldacci novels. Need more starting Agent Puller!!
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|We loved it, funny, heartwarming, great ending. The whole family liked this movie, it was fun for everyone, no bad words either.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|My great  ganddaughter (2 1/2) loves the movie Dispicable Me and tries toplay the game but it is to fast for her. If I could slow it down some we would rate it 5 stars.
B00821PCJS|5.0|It was great. Hoping for another season. It kept me going week after week.<br />The acting was good and the plot keep intrigued.
630542845X|1.0|Will not buy again now I have to pack it up and go to the post office wait in line to send this back and pay for it, what a waist.  The one movie my girl friend wanted to watch as soon as we got it.  Hope some one reads this, I spend a few bucks with Amazon
B00F8H0LM2|2.0|You have to use extra characters to achieve all the levels or collect all the extras.  Extra characters are easy to get but seems to me this is like cheating or easter eggs.  Cannot win all with the basic characters.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Program is very well done and has very glamorous costumes.  Should be a natural for awards.  Keep up the good work!
B009JBWOU0|5.0|The movies are in very good condition and I have had no problems with them at all. I also love the case that the movies came in, it's really cool! Good buy! :)
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|i really enjoyed this book very much!!! i was literally laughing out loud in my class room!!! i would highly recommend to anyone that loves to laugh!!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|This novel was a good and engrossing book.  It made me want to continue to read more of Mr. Flynn's books.
B00BBURAFG|5.0|Each Lordi album seems to be heavier and more over the top than the last.<br />They never take themselves too seriously.<br />Real Metal music is supposed to be fun not depressing.<br />Overall it exceeded my expectations.<br />Hilarious when you listen to the lyrics but sounds amazing if you just want something energetic.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great movie. Thought the movie was entertaining. Had not read the book. Looking forward to the next movie in the series.
B007RE0RR8|5.0|Such a pretty doll....an interesting concept. Appeals to collectors of all ages and to young girls and even teenagers.  Delightful.

0767827791|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. It was made during an era that generated a number of classic films. I know that by today's standards it's probably a bit campy but after trying to watch the recent release &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34; (with its scenes of masses in period garb gyrating to electronic dance music while a &#34;band&#34; faked playing in the background) I realized that Picnic was clearly the more accurate reflection of the post war era in which it was filmed. I'm glad that I added Picnic to our collection of classic films.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|i recieve game as free game of day. very easy to play. have not completed yet so i am not sure if it gets harder. but as of right now it is not to challenging
B0070Y46UY|1.0|The worst book I have ever read. No respect for animals of the wild! Just sensationalism at its worst. Makes the worst arguments for keeping animals in zoos or circuses. Just do not read this book... it will make you sick!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Wonderful for getting organized!  I tend to forget lots of little things, but with this program on my Kindle I can solve that problem now.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|The story starts out like just another story about a man's remembrance of his early youth, but slowly a new reality begins to take shape. The reader is sucked in to the story like an apple core into the disposal.  The warmth of the telling made me feel safe even in the scary parts.  We all have a little person in us long after we grow into adults.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I've loved this opera since I was 11.  Finally a great movie worthy of the music and story!  And it has Gerard Butler!
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I love this movie and it is fantastic in Blu-ray 3D. I would recommend it to a friend. You won't be disappointed unless you don't like action movies...
B004VMUS9G|5.0|There are so many different alarm sounds from which to choose.  I don't worry about sleeping through the alarm anymore!
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|I was loving the show till they killed off Matthew! Come on people pay the actor some more money to stay! After all it took for Mary and Matthew to be together and then he tragically dies after his son is born?? This show is one tragedy after another and my heart can't take it anymore!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|While recouping from foot surgery, I had the 3 seasons to watch.  Well worth the money, made time go quickly, and didn't have to wait for over 3 years.  The best.  Thank you
B008X8P8A8|4.0|it's a good game that I believe so. but how can a story with no Chinese!? I can't follow the story with English. waiting for Chinese next time!<br /><br />and BTW: amazon game circle built on game??? It  seems not  works well if it is .
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Life of Pi captures the imagination...such great story telling and cinematography! One of the best movies ever in my opinion.
B0086700CM|5.0|works great on kindle. easy controls and intuitive. fun for kids, adults and everyone in between. great game and so far bug free.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Must read for all young women and men. It was a valuable read and I could not recommend it more highly.

B00F8H0LM2|5.0|We love angry birds. This game is fun and has nice twists to it that are different then the other star wars. My 3 year old loves it and it's free.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|Like all &#34;Die Hard&#34; movies this one was packed with action.  It had everything an action movie requires, car chases, explosions, etc.  I felt this one was written and had a cast as good as the first.

B00BP4X3W2|5.0|THis  movie shows the cruilty of the Nazis. We would hope that nothing like this could happen again but not the case  many people are going throuth persicution. We need to pray for  people who are being persecuted today
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|This is a Good movie. I would have given it a 5 if they had kept it under 2 hours.
B009A9BEHU|5.0|Love Coldplay. First saw this concert on Netflix and found the Live Album here. Amazing vocals and a great concert album to hear on long drives.
B005544TRQ|3.0|It was okay for some afternoon entertainment but not what I expected.  I will probably watch more episodes if given the chance.
B002UWH8P6|4.0|Amazing show, but ended to quickly.<br /><br />See Amazon here we are again, forcing me to write a review when others said what I would have said. This is why I don't rate things. Now if you did not force me to write this to give it a few stars then it would probably get more people rating things and I wouldn't end up with a 2 star movie that is rated as a 4 because people didn't feel like all this typing just to rate a movie.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|My daughter and her friends love this movie and always request to watch it when they come over to play.

B008P1EWIM|5.0|Very useful app. I wish there could be some weather alerts added to this. Especially for Oklahoma. But otherwise very useful.
B0088W6IMQ|4.0|This is an awesome show and people who watched it loved it. I hated they ended the whole stargate series.<br /><br />I really wish Amazon would just let me rate something how I like it rather than make me sit here and write a review...just let me rate it without a review. I don't feel like writing a review of everything I liked just because I liked it. I liked it...end of story. Give me the option to write a review and if it doesn't already have 500 others saying what I would say I will write one.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|This book took me forever to get into, it felt like nothing happened until 2/3 of the book was finished. I will still be reading the rest in the series, I'm just hoping that the rest are better.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I can't think of anyone who wouldn't love this book! I have the next two in the series and will be diving into the second one as soon as I finish this review. A great many relatable characters in Wool I hope to see more of.

B000FC0ZAI|5.0|A great read! Liam Callahan will be visiting Altoona, Wi. Library soon. Normally I do not read World War 'll books but I enjoyed this book. It is suspenseful and a story of love lost and found, about friendship. I can hardly wait for the author visit to find out if some of the events actually happened during the end of the war.
B001Z65KNA|4.0|Thank you! I really liked re-watching the movies. Brought smiles to my face. I am glad I bought them. geez, this summary is more than I bargained for...
B004LP3AYI|4.0|The story is great and a quick read. The editing of the book is questionable. There are repeated words, wrong words, and missing words. BUT it did not take away from the story.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Kept me guessing all the way through.<br /><br />Very well cast with believable characters. Eagerly awaiting a second series.<br /><br />David Tennant is a great actor.
0451232577|5.0|Ken Follett is a master story teller and again I could not put the book down.  Highly recommended read as he has a knack of bringing you into each family without being confused. His research is excellent.
B0004Z33G4|4.0|Sylvester Stallone's body was out of this world unbelievable. I don't remember his hair being so awesome too. Good memories watching them again.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|Impossible not to compare with Band of Brothers. This seemed a bit rushed. It sorely needed more episodes to further explore the experiences each was going through, and the war in the Pacific in general. I'm glad I bought it, but it certainly wanted for more.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|In reading most memorable books there are always unanswered questions. Sleep Doctor answered all the Shining \\"I wonder what happened to\\" questions but in true fashion left us with wanting more. Great book.

B00BSO2U1Y|5.0|What an interesting crop of reviews!  It's clear that Maria Callas has changed forever how listeners hear \\"Norma,\\" yet surely hers is not the only valid approach to this work.  While listening to this new version, I was struck by how much Bellini's musical world resembles Mozart's and how different that world sounds from Verdi's and Puccini's.  The tarnished reputation of \\"bel canto\\" works in the last century seems to have driven conductors and record producers of \\"Norma\\" to underscore its connection to early Verdi works such as \\"Ernani\\" and \\"Nabucco\\" instead of treating it as the culmination of an ongoing tradition that began many years earlier.  This \\"Norma\\" made me think more frequently of \\"Idomeneo\\" and \\"Don Giovanni\\" (to say nothing of \\"La Sonnambula,\\" \\"L'elisir d'amore,\\" \\"Guillaume Tell\\" and others), than of \\"La Traviata\\" and \\"Rigoletto.\\"  That alone seems to me a significant accomplishment, by itself worth the price of the album.<br /><br />Much has been said in other reviews about the conductor's quick tempos, but, at the very least, the clarity of the orchestral playing and the lightness of the period instruments used in this recording certainly allow for faster tempos than are standard.  (I found the tempo choices here unusual but always tasteful and, upon repeated listening, dramatically effective.)  I also very much enjoyed the balance between vocal and orchestral forces that was struck in this recording and was amazed by how many details in the score I had failed to notice when listening to other versions.  (The choice to open up traditional cuts was also much appreciated.)  The reversal of vocal ranges here--Norma as mezzo, Adalgisa as soprano--was inspired and underscored both characters' emotional depths.  After all, Norma is \\"seasoned\\" by her tormented life in ways that Adalgisa has yet to experience, and hearing Norma's music taken by Cecelia Bartoli made me understand more deeply not only Norma's fury at Pollione for rejecting her for a younger rival but also her conflicted behavior toward her two secret children.  Bartoli and Sumi Jo worked beautifully together here.  And John Osborne's bell-like tenor  emphasized Pollione's youth and attractiveness to two very different women.  Bellini's librettist, Felice Romani, well understood the pathos in the Norma-Adalgisa-Pollione conflict, but this recording made me appreciate anew how effectively Bellini presented this conflict musically.<br /><br />Although I greatly admire the Callas and Sutherland recordings of \\"Norma,\\" I have always felt that they have had a regrettably chilling effect on new productions of \\"Norma.\\"  Anyone who undertakes the title role, for example, is setting herself up for immediate--and often cruel--comparison with a recorded legacy that is difficult to trump, which is unfortunate.  From what I've read of Callas and Sutherland's feelings about \\"Norma,\\" however, I don't think either would have wanted her \\"Norma\\" recordings to be a reason for singers and producers to steer clear of the work and for audiences to reject new approaches to it.  Callas, in particular, was a stickler for musical scholarship and for honoring the composer's intentions, and I think she would have been intrigued by the approach taken by Bartoli and her collaborators in this new version.  There certainly is nothing shoddy about this production; everything had been treated thoughtfully and lovingly.  For example, if opera companies were willing to lower orchestral pitch (as this recording's producers wisely chose) to approximate the pitch used in Bellini's time, perhaps more singers and producers could be enticed to mount \\"Norma\\" and other works that present tremendous difficulties solely because of our modern taste for orchestral pitches that are much higher than was standard in the early nineteenth century.

B008JFUO4U|5.0|I almost went to see this movie in the theater, but ended up passing it by.  I bought the Blu-ray and was expecting a strictly action/sci-fi movie with a lot of cool visuals and not a lot of plot.  I was right about the action and visuals, they are great in Oblivion.  However, the plot is what really surprised me.<br />It went from being a good action movie to a GREAT \\"thinking\\" movie.  Kinda like Inception or a similar movie where it really makes you stop and say, wait a minute, what's going on here...<br />I love movies that have an interesting and dynamic deep storyline, and Oblivion ends up having that. Personally, for my movie taste, I loved it, and it is definitely a movie that you will get more out of by watching it more than once.  I highly recommend it for people that like a good action/sci-fi type movie that also has a lot of storyline thought put into it.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|I'd heard about this movie but didn't know much about it.  I finally found a copy in a Cheap DVDs bin and bought it.  Wow.  I wish I'd seen it at the theater.<br /><br />This is filmed entirely on a camcorder (or is made to look like it), which adds to the horror effect.  It begins at a wedding party, so you get a good feel of normality, of the lives of the main characters, but then something attacks the city.  It isn't clear what, as you only know what the characters experience.<br /><br />Imagine a tragedy happening that destroys New York.  A terrorist attack on the entire city (instead of just two buildings), a hurricane that leaves the city in crumbles, something the rest of the country is watching on the news in shock.  What would it be like to find a camcorder afterwards, somewhere in the destroyed city, that shows what was going on as it was happening?  A whole two hours or so of video as it was occurring?<br /><br />That is Cloverfield.  There's no soundtrack, no music in the background.  This is nothing but what you would see as you were watching a video taken on the scene.  It's not at all like other horror movies, and as such, is definitely worth watching.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This is one of the best books i've read.  Sarah and her story haunted me.  We must never forget the tragedy of the Holacaust.
B002X6PTH8|5.0|My son LOVES Jim Carey and this is his new favorite movie. Good family movie. Both teenagers and young kids will like it.
B00936A0RU|5.0|Some years ago director John Hillcoat and screenwriter Nick Cave collaborated on a film called \\"The Proposition\\" set during Australia's colonial period that was definitely informed by Sergio Leone, Sam Peckinpah, and Clint Eastwood but had enough original flourishes to stand as a true original.  \\"Lawless\\" is cut from the same mold except the setting is Prohibition era Franklin County, Virginia.  Bootleg whiskey for generations was the county's primary industry and there was a gentleman's agreement between the manufacturers of moonshine and law enforcement that kept the business thriving.  Where there is a buck to be made, however, there are outsiders who want a piece of the action and they come in the form of a Chicago gangster(Gary Oldman) and a sadistic U.S. attorney(Guy Pearce).  The film focuses on the Bondurant family whose motto is \\"We control fear.  Fear doesn't control us\\".  The oldest brother Forrest (Tom Hardy) is bloodied but unbowed and will protect the family interests at all costs.  As in \\"The Proposition\\" Hillcoat doesn't shy away from the violence that's a byproduct of these turf wars.  You get a real sense of time and place with exquisite period art direction.  Cave is also the music arranger and provides a score that evokes Appalachia.  The standout performances here would probably be Hardy and Pearce.  Not for the squeamish but an accurate history.
B00CEK9OTM|3.0|I play this in my Samsung note and it's pretty sensitive to the movement, almost as the real game. The thing I don't like at all is that I can't really see the whole maze at the start.

B0055MBQOM|4.0|This gizmo works well with Windows 7 and a TFT display. It calibrates colors and brightness in a few minutes (about 4 for me). I generally like my displays a bit dimmer than most folks, and ColorMunki turned it down even a bit more, but once I got used to that, I could tell that the color was more accurate.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|An eye opener that you will never forget and always have in your heart. This story will make you a very grateful person.... not only that you don't have an unusual face, but that those who do are such an inspiration to everyone.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|There was lots of action and heroes and exciting special effects.  But, I was not drawn into this movie.  Probably because there was not enough effort to develop the story in order to fully engage this viewer.  Others may think this is a good or even great movie.  As with all movies, give it a look and decide how you feel about it for yourself.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Fun game but the app crashed several t times within an  hour and coins are u used too fast. Other games offer to buy coins with tokens obtained in the game.
1455113549|1.0|The audio book book was smashed flat when it arrived.  The packaging was a mailing envelope, instead of mailing the audio book in a crush proof box.  Each and every disk had a problem with skipping or repeating a word, like stuttering.  Neither the box or the disks were in good shape when they arrived.  I would not buy from this seller again.  It was a complete waste of money and time!

B003YL4LYI|5.0|I was captivated even knowing beyond a doubt that this was fiction, I was unable to put the book down.  The only minor negatives were the unusual use of Martin's creative &#34;language.&#34;  The use of &#34;ser&#34; and some of the unusual character names slowed my reading pace, but not enough to take away my enjoyment.  I was thrilled to see the development of the main character, Dany Stormborn, from a shy young maid to the true &#34;Mother of Dragons.&#34;
B00DTDKTCO|5.0|I don't think words can express my love for Colleen Hoover and her writing. She had me since Slammed and now I stalk her every move. In very creepy way, yes I will unashamedly admit it. I am obsessed. I really can't explain it, but your gonna have to listen to me try ;)<br /><br />I was so excited for this book to released and I started it immediately. We are thrown into the action from the prologue. I had lots of questions; who was this girl? Why was her world falling apart? And most importantly who had hurt her? It was such a powerful way to begin what went on to be a great story and it held me captive for the next six hours or so.<br /><br />Sky is starting her senior year, but thanks to her very persuasive friend she is attending high school for the first time rather than being home schooled by her mum. So Sky is looking forward to all the trappings of public school. She will soon go on to learn gossip and rumours are part of that package.<br /><br />What Sky doesn't count on is running into Holder, there is a connection between the two but then that could be Holder's creepy fascination with Sky when he first bumps into her. She seems so familiar to him. So with some reluctance on Sky's part, she and Holder continue to get to know each other. I loved the progression of their relationship; it was so sweet yet equally funny. Sky was the typical sheltered teen and she was discovering boys and a social life for the first time.<br /><br />I thought I knew how this story was going to play out, why I thought I could predict the brilliant mind of Colleen Hoover, I will never know. I chalk that up to a rookie mistake. ;) So yes we knew Sky's background had missing blanks and we knew Holder was guarding a secret, I will admit I worried they were related at one point (icky I know) but rest assured they are not. I remember reading the part of Holder's confession and gasping aloud thinking \\"No Way!!\\" It was that good!<br /><br />From then on out Sky needs Holder more than ever as she questions everything about her life and what it means for her. Sky had blocked out most of her past, she couldn't remember it, and when the memories slowly resurfaced it was heartbreaking. I couldn't see the book for the tears running down my face. The subject matter could make some readers uncomfortable but I thought it was handled so well, it was honest and real. And sometimes the truth does hurt.<br /><br />I truly did believe the surprises were over in this story, that was mistake number two (will I ever learn?) When Sky and Holder visit her old house and the major event that takes place, I was gobsmacked to say the least. I think I was more surprised at the action in this novel, it is truly a big departure from the Slammed series but that is a great thing. They each stand on their own.<br /><br />My favourite part of this story, if it is even possible to pick, was the intimacy Sky and Holder shared, the scene where they finally give themselves completely to the other was so profound. Tears are forming in my eyes as I write this, I am such a sap!! But it was a beautiful piece of writing and will forever remain one of my favourite quotes of all time!<br /><br />\\"I want you to keep them open...because I need you to watch me give you the very last piece of my heart.\\"<br /><br />Do you get what I mean?? **sigh**<br /><br />I loved this book, I loved the writing, I loved the connection I felt to the words, I loved each and every single character no matter how small or big their role was but do you know what I love most about Colleen Hoover's writing? It is the humour. Did I expect to laugh throughout a book with a serious and tough subject matter? No I didn't but I love Colleen's blend of humour and heartache and with a book that makes you feel, you definitely need a mixture of the two.<br /><br />With every Colleen Hoover book, there are features that become synonymous with each story. We have Slam poetry, jars of stars and now we never need to worry abouttypos again when telling someone we love them as Colleen has coined the term \\"I live you\\". And really that was a lovely part of the book. Sky and Holder were in between like and love so they lived each other for that moment in time and it was perfect.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone that says Hi to me or glances in my direction so watch out! I've lost count of the number of copies I have of this book in every format! If you haven't read it you need to rectify this immediately. It's more than a book, it's an experience! ~Ava<br /><br />*I received a copy of this book via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.*typos again when telling someone we love them as Colleen has coined the term \\"I live you\\".

B008G3N71W|5.0|No one writes erotica as well as Chloe Thurlow. EL James with her Fifty Shades showed there is an appetite for the erotic. Chloe Thurlow in the subtle, flowing style that recalls Anaïs Nin shows us that the erotic is a literary genre where the first rule is: Good Writing. [new paragraph] A Girl's Adventure tells the story of an out of work actress who will do anything to climb the ladder to success. Her journey into the deepest realms of submission and bondage can be seen as a metaphor for the artistic struggle, her moments of shame and degradation more than balanced by the redemptive glow of the spotlight as she steps out to play the lead role in a major new play on the London stage.
B005LAIIGW|5.0|ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW<br /><br />Just moments after this movie ended my daughter leaned over to me and declared, \\"This is the most perfect film I have ever seen in just about every way.\\"<br /><br />I had to agree.<br /><br />GRAVITY gives you everything: thrilling action, awesome visuals, incomparable cinematic spectacle, a terrifying scenario, an exciting adventure, and a masterpiece of minimalist characterization. They all combine in one pedal-to-the-metal slam-bam technically perfect movie that gives you equal shots of hope and hopelessness from the first frame to the very last.<br /><br />It is as electrifying a film as I have ever seen, with scarcely a down moment in it, hardly a misused frame. I won't spend time telling you anything about the plot; if the trailers haven't told you enough about why this film is a must see, then I can give you two words that should do it...<br /><br />Sandra Bullock.<br /><br />She is not only in practically every frame of the movie, but she exposes herself emotionally here in more ways than I could count: she is equal parts victim and heroine, emotional and calculating, frightened and bold, wounded and powerful.  She is a tortured soul who reveals herself in dribs and drabs, revealing her emotional torment when it will have the most effect.  The movie is as much about what HAS happened to her as what IS happening to her. She is able to make herself as interesting and captivating as the events that occur during the film, and this is important: rather than simply being a movie about a series of cascading terrors, it is equally about the human spirit, the \\"stuff\\" that lies inside us that drives us to go on when going on seems impossible.<br /><br />GRAVITY is amazing. See it in IMAX 3D if you can; it is worth the money. The technology depicted in the movie is stunning--but I imagine I will be as amazed when I finally get the DVD and find out HOW these truly amazing scenes were shot. Alfonso Cuaron does remarkable job as director, co-writer and co-editor of this absolutely wonderful accomplishment. His technically perfect movie never loses track of the actor within it--I won't be surprised if this achieves Best Picture, Best Directing and Best Acting nominations this year, notwithstanding a half-dozen other technically-related ones.<br /><br />There have been some critics who have found fault with the movie's accuracy when it comes to the positioning of the space stations, the likelihood of a debris field causing a \\"Kesslar Syndrome\\" this devastating, and some other technical flaws, but I will leave these people to their respective perturbations. To me it doesn't matter if GRAVITY is science fiction or simply fiction about science. What it definitely IS is a tour de force balls-to-the-wall spectacle that will leave you gasping.

To me it doesn't matter if GRAVITY is science fiction or simply fiction about science. What it definitely IS is a tour de force balls-to-the-wall spectacle that will leave you gasping. Don't miss it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think it is the best game ever.. The only thing I don't like is my kindle Fire freezes and the game also freezes...
B000E33W1W|1.0|I know I am going against the tide here but when I saw this movie in the theater I walked out almost wanting my money back.  It was not funny (obviously the audience thought so judging by the laughs) and it was just too simple and silly.  To me, Sigourney Weaver's talent was totally wasted.  At times even her usually excellent acting seemed stilted, as though she really was not thrilled to be in this production.<br /><br />It was also not believable that an intelligent character such as she portrayed would fall in any way for that dork.  Give me a break!<br /><br />This movie was just plain silly, plain and simple.  It's popularity eludes me.  I've seen every actor in it in much better films.  Wasn't their fault; they did their best with an infantile script.<br /><br />This one has definitely been a pass for me.  :(

140006922X|4.0|Aslon pens to separate the historical Jesus from the religious tradition, a mighty serious endeavor indeed.<br />  Somehow, I just wish he had written a novel instead.<br />  Obviously, the religious tradition leaves a bit to be desired in terms historical verisimilitude.  No one with an inquiring nature could so doubt, but, I have often wondered how accurate are the reports of last week's adventures.<br />  Still, the attempt to place Jesus and his disciples into their historical milieu is an endeavor worthy of Sisyphus and is an interesting

B00ESY77LO|1.0|This movie was a big disappointment. Story line was stupid, too much singing. Do not rent this movie. If you want to see it wait till it comes on t.v.
0345803493|4.0|The book was good. I enjoyed the story. A bit to much detail at times for my taste. But I enjoyed this
1609611543|4.0|Great book that I have already gifted to some friends.  Davis goes on a bit long about celiac disease and is more open to artificial sugars than I am, but maybe those topics are the ones that interest you the most. Even if not, it pulls the curtain back on what the government push for whole grains (genetically modified)  is doing to us all.  I went gluten free after reading this book 6 weeks ago and I don't regret it at all.  Lost significant weight, too.

B001NLKXK2|2.0|The topic is important and interesting but this book was not very interesting or engaging. Story was good - writing just OK.
0345803507|4.0|I enjoyed book 3 best of all. I loved at the end of the book when they had story of christian. I enjoyed readding from his take.
B0006J28BO|5.0|I love Japanese cartoons and so do my kids.  I love the lack of screaming, rudenss and the overall respect the kids in these movies show for their parents and other elders.<br /><br />All that being said, this is an odd one.  I mean a young girl is being forced to marry a cat - after (of course?) being turned into a cat.<br /><br />Odd.
B000YJ85BI|4.0|I enjoyed the story well, and the character development, but wish there had been more time focusing on the development of the colony; after the buildup of the people and equipment going as part of the colony, they (and indeed, virtually every other colonist) were largely ignored thereafter. All in all, however, a good read.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|It was an interesting movie.  Was trying to figure it out and was very pleased at the way they brought it all together in the end.  We're going to buy the move because it is one of those movies that you find more and more each time you watch it.

B008ALA6DW|5.0|Of course 99% of the time Wifi works great and don't need this adapter.  But once in a while, when either Wifi is down/not available somewhere (a rarity) or when I need to data transfer large amounts of data (occasionally) where wired is faster than Wifi, this is very handy to have on hand.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|It was a very interesting movie.  Wasn't sure if Mud was a good guy or crazy guy until the end.  Kept up my interest!  Makes you think about Love - what it is - how it hopes to change things - how hard it is to let go.
B007US9NA8|5.0|Great and Inspiring!!!!!!!! One of the most interesting sport\health book i've ever read. As always Arnold give is best also in this book!!!!!
0385523394|5.0|I originally picked chose this book after watching the entire series in a short time, as EVERYONE was talking about it. While the screen version is a fantastic adaptation, the book has much to offer. Consider paying for a wrong doing when you were young. Actually, TEN YEARS later...imagine all the level of maturity and wisdom gained in those 10 years. Now, you pay for the wrong doing by being plucked from your daily life and put in a completely different society....different rules, different means of gaining respect and individuals you may have never taken the time to know before. All of a sudden you are see people differently. Everyone is dressed the same, all their possessions are the same as yours - you are forced to see what really differentiates people...personalities, character, heart. If we could all live a bit more like this in our current lives we would have more tolerance and less frustration. Its a lesson in navigating life outside of the bars.
B009K916ZK|4.0|Works fine, bought for those instances when traveling and have presentation but setup at location is for PC/VGA.  One gripe with apple -- will not permit you to hook up macbook air and play itunes movie purchases/rentals because of their DRM restrictions.  I would assert that the fact that I am playing from iTunes should suffice that I have rights to view the movie on my TV using this adapter.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Palacio's &#34;Wonder&#34; is an inspiring novel with many unsuspected twists. I could go on and on about how much I love this book but I think I might spoil it for all of you. REAS THIS BOOK
B00B52F278|2.0|having enjoyed the first two series and read the reviews for the last two, i thought id give this season a whirl. succinctly; the acting was poor, the fighting skill obviously lacks a doctore, the plot line soap operatic, and the tension contrived and inorganic. definitely NOT the superb finale others have touted...honestly, not even worth the watch. what was left to mystery and history after the &#34;first&#34; season was more fulfilling to ones imagination than the superficial, milktoast tripe the studio cranked out to appease the masses.
031624662X|4.0|Breq is an ancillary, an animated corpse possessed by the controlling intelligence of a vast starship, the Justice of Toren. The Justice was destroyed more than twenty years ago, with Breq as the sole survivor and the only person to hold a secret that could tear the interstellar empire known as the Radch apart. Breq, now driven by grief and vengeance, goes in search of the only weapon that can accomplish her goal.<br /><br />Ancillary Justice is the debut novel by American author Ann Leckie, who has already established herself as a writer of short stories. It's an interesting SF novel which riffs on a whole load of ideas. The most striking is the one of identity. Breq is a tiny, splintered part of a much vaster, destroyed intelligence and has difficulties in relating to other people and the world around her. She's also effectively possessing a dead body and suffers from a cultural bias. The Radchaai do not believe in gender differentiation and go to some lengths to keep their gender unclear. The culture defaults to describing everyone in the feminine, resulting in odd moments when a character you've spent a dozen pages mentally picturing as female actually turns out to be male. This playing around with gender roles is not new - Ursula Le Guin did it rather more literally in The Left Hand of Darkness more than forty years ago - but it's something that relatively few SF authors have dealt with before and forces the reader to confront their own biases.<br /><br />Those looking for in-depth worldbuilding and explanations for this SF universe will be left disappointed. There's little information on the amazingly powerful armour that protects the Radchaai, nor much on how their ships work. FTL travel gets relatively short shrift, and the only hint as to the fate of Earth is a single line about how it's a remote backwater. There is a slight inconsistency in that the Radch's tech level, though impressive, appears to be reasonably believable until someone casually throws itout there that they've also built a Dyson sphere, which seems beyond their capabilities. I daresay that the inevitable future books in the series (yes, there will be at least two more) will reveal more, but in this volume the author is focusing more on the immediate story at hand.<br /><br />Structurally the book adopts a tried-and-tested technique of alternating between flashback chapters showing what happened to the Justice of Toren and why (and doing a good job of showing how massive events can unfold from the tiniest of causes), and events in the present day. Characterisation is reasonably strong, with Leckie showing how citizens of the Radch differ from one another whilst retaining the same cultural and religious traits. Breq herself is well-drawn, as the ship AIs in Leckie's setting are perfectly capable of having emotions and development (and indeed, Breq's actions are catalysed by what happens to one of her favourite crewmembers).<br /><br />Whilst a lot of reviews are drawing comparisons with Le Guin, I was also reminded of the works of Iain Banks, particularly in the idea of living ships with their own goals and motivations and how they work when placed in humanoid bodies. What Leckie shares with both authors is more of a fascination with the social sciences than the hard ones, and also a belief in storytelling that also challenges the reader.<br /><br />Ancillary Justice (****) is one of the most striking SF debuts of recent years. It's not perfect - the restrained prose sometimes risks stodginess and the opening chapters risk an almost Eriksonian level of confusion due to a lack of context for what the hell is going on (though this is still well-handled) - but ultimately the novel evolves into an intelligent take on gender roles and identity issues against a fascinating (if only hinted-at) SF backdrop. More please.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|purchasing didn't end the popup ads this app has.<br />it also didn't remove old free version and that still shows up in carousel.<br />it freaks me out to purchase something and yet be bugged for no good reason.<br />the clock itself isn't extraordinary, its just that this marketplace doesn't has all good things yet.
0307346617|5.0|Book is based on eye witness accounts and perspectives. I barely recognized any two characters from the book that were portrayed in the movie. You really should read the book before watching the movie. The should not have called the movie World War Z. Its a totally different storyline.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|this is just a great dvd, it can be watched in 2d or 3d and both are great to watch... item shipped on time and well packed will do it again...
B0084TWN9K|4.0|I truly enjoyed these little stories and their often surprising endings. What a great book when you're looking for a good read you can only enjoy in short spurts.
0525478817|5.0|I could go on and on about this book because honestly this is the Best book I have ever read. Its corky, lovable and heartbreaking all at once. This book hits you with a rush of combined raw emotions that at times can be hard to handle. Buy it, Read it, Love it - trust me you wont regret it =') <3 !
B000XUBFE2|2.0|Boring. So boring. Why does everyone love and recommend this book? It's the same old WWII story. Read a good memoir from someone who actually lived through it rather than this fictionalized crap. It was so boring.
B009NX1YT6|3.0|Okay but cornier than I remembered.  Music is pretty good but acting leaves a lot to be desired. Fun 1 time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really like this game. I like that there are a lot of challenges and that there are a lot of costumes to wear. Really enjoying the GAME.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|read all three books in a a week. I miss the characters already. I couldn't out the books down. best books I've ever read!
B009PMEEY2|3.0|I thought this was like jewlust , I love that game, but when I downloaded this game & played it I was bee disappointed as it was hard to play.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|It is beautiful to watch. I love the attention to detail in the set and costumes. I love the story line as well, but this season was just too sad for me to give 5 stars to. One of my favorite characters leaving I could have handled, but not both. Still, I'll be tuning in dutifully to season four to see what happens next.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I'm glad they finally made this game for the kindle. Super fun, and Super addictive! now if only they would make candy crush!!!!!
0743289692|5.0|Ayaan Hirsi has created biography that the world must read in order for civilization to continue to move forward to prevent abuse of women whether from cultural or religious basis.  Her facts are fully substantiated globally from international statistics and historical data.  A sophisticated riveting novel both captivating and shockingly informative.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Loved it!!!  Very interesting,  I could not put it down. Want to grind out what happens next. Recommend this highly.
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|Do you want to know that best way to win me over as a reader? I'm a sucker for well done Star Wars references and if you can put them in a new and unusual way then I will probably like the rest of the book just based on that one thing.  But good for me the rest of the book was just as brilliant and unusual as the Star Wars reference that spoke to my nerdy little heart.<br /><br />\\"You can be Han Solo,\\" he said, kissing her throat. \\"And I'll be Boba Fett. I'll cross the sky for you.\\"<br /><br />Parts of this book are beautiful and parts of it made me angry at characters to my core.  As a step-parent of a teenager it is so difficult for me to read of parents who treat their children in a neglectful or mean way.  I will say that this is a great book for both teens and parents of teens.  I've heard this book is being banned for language in some schools and that is too bad.  There is no way to shelter children from everything and I'm for exposing them to language and questionable situations in order to keep an open dialog and prepare them for the world, but that is just my own parenting technique.  I'm sure my 16-year old has heard much much worse at school and life in general.  Most of the bad language in the book is from the abusive step-father anyway and is very much a part of his character.  I don't think he would have come across nearly as bad if the language he used was changed.<br /><br />Okay so now that that part is settled onto the actual book.<br /><br />This is a book about real people.  Not the perfect and pretty, but the people who are not at the top of the pyramid in High School.  The people who don't exactly fit in and most of the time just try to keep their heads down to just get through it.<br /><br />Eleanor comes from a very disadvantaged family life.  That in itself wouldn't be so bad, being poor is not a crime, but her stepfather is abusive and most of the time Eleanor just tries to be invisible.  The last time she wasn't invisible she was kicked out of her house for over a year.  I felt for Eleanor right away, she has so many things going against her it would be so easy to give up but she trudges on.<br /><br />Park has a mostly happy home life.  His parents are still madly in love (odd enough) and he isn't in the in crowd but he isn't a total outcast either.  He runs in the middle and does just enough that he isn't on anyone's list. He lets the new Girl sit next to him on the bus one day and after that a slow friendship of sorts starts to kindle.  It is so small at first but it is changing everything in Park's life.<br /><br />\\"What are the chances you'd ever meet someone like that? he wondered. Someone you could love forever, someone who would forever love you back? And what did you do when that person was born half a world away? The math seemed impossible.\\"<br /><br />There were so many cute moments that were completely tender, innocent and loving.  Remember how exciting it was the first time you held the hand of someone you really liked.  Remember how it felt the first time you kissed a person you honestly cared for.  This took me back through a lot of innocent first in a most fantastic way.  Both Eleanor and Park are real and unsure of their bodies.  They are awkward at times and in loving each other maybe learn to accept themselves for who they are a little bit more.<br /><br />\\"He made her feel like more than the sum of her parts.\\"<br /><br />Besides the Eleanor and Park story line I loved the portrayal of Parks parents.  Unlike other YA novels where the parents are absent or over the top Parks parents seem real.  Park and his parents don't always agree, they don't always get along but they always love him.  They are ever present in his life and do everything they can to support Park in everything he does.  His mom totally grew on me and I really loved her so much by the end.<br /><br />On the opposite side of the spectrum was Eleanor's home life.  Her mother in an abusive relationship, with five children thrown into the mix, just made me angry as a parent.  It was not easy to read about Eleanor's home life and I didn't get how bad it really was until revelations were made later.  I teared up to read Eleanor didn't even have a toothbrush, the neglect was so awful and probably so honest it was difficult.<br /><br />This story will have many moments that make you smile and some that make you sad.  I swung hard on both sides of the spectrum.  But, it is totally worth it.  It is beautiful and about a love that you hope will stand the test of time.  Maybe we are not perfect but we are possibly perfect for someone else.  In my book Eleanor and Park are perfect for no one else except each other.ren thrown into the mix, just made me angry as a parent.

B000QRIGLC|4.0|Overall a good read, brought tears to my eyes. Slow going with the whole training start but once the war stories start, it's hard to put down. I finished the book in  a day with great respect and appreciation for SEALS and other armed service members.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|How much drama can you take?  Well, when it is this well developed into a story line....plenty!  It is my guilty pleasure :)
B0043D2L9S|2.0|Two things first:<br />1. Lowepro should make it clear that this harness is really meant for their S&F Deluxe Technical Belt and NOT for the S&F Light Utility Belt.<br />2. I wish it came with some instructions.<br /><br />I bought it only to scratch my head for about an hour...trying to figure out how the 'special locks' latch onto something on my Light Utility Belt. Nowhere will they connect to my belt. Then I looked carefully at the S&F Deluxe Technical Belt's photos online...and THEN I realized that, that belt has the nylon strap loops which these \\"special lock\\" thingies latch onto. With the S&F Deluxe Technical Belt this harness will be (almost) a quick disconnect. Almost because the rear connection to the belt is not a quick disconnect. You may be able to use the metal loops on the light utility belt but it is not an ideal connection and it also leaves the special lock thingies dangling, only to dig into your belly.<br /><br />Just in case you are wondering....the two other extra straps included with this harness are meant to connect (again) the S&F Deluxe Technical Belt to a big shoulder bag carried on your back, dangling from the cup contraption. Those straps are not really compatible with your light utility belt.<br /><br />This harness sure looks pretty bulky. I was also feeling slightly warm wearing it. I think it is simpler to use the cross strap which was included with my Light Utility Belt.<br /><br />I regret purchasing this harness. Too bad I threw away the box otherwise I'd have returned it. Oh well, it will be on the 'bay soon.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Great way to unwind and have fun.  Nothing violent unless you're a spider.  Good for almost any age and easy to put down and come back to later without losing the momentum of the game.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I gave it five stars because my wife loves it. I personally have never watched it, but I absolutely love it on Broadway.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|It is a very beautiful and true story.  I shows that their is more to a person than the color of their skin.  There should be more movies teaching that.  You have to get to know someone before deciding that you do or don't like them.  Keep this type of movie coming.<br /><br />Lois Johnston

B009YP9L7U|1.0|I have tried several times to read this book with the hope that it will become interesting enough to continue.  However, after only 10 per cent read I have decided to give up on it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Excellent Book. I can understand why it was the book of the month on Amazon.  a must read.  love it
B0029ATTAQ|5.0|I love the novel and, now, the film! Considering this is the only production of the film in circulation, it's a great buy! Also, it helps to understand what's going on in the film if you've read the novel. If you haven't read the novel, it may be confusing at times as to what's going on.
034580404X|3.0|I would call them abit worse than gently used. The picture shows them in the box. There was no box for the set. The books were creased and well worn. I was giving them to someone and felt the picture did not match the product.

B006CEKZ4Y|3.0|Everyone within the film world will always make references to Citizen Kane at some point. The film was revolutionary for it's time and helped pave the way for modern cinematography, but the film itself wasn't that great. It was boring and times and rather confusing. I'm a film student and would recommend other young filmmakers to watch it, just don't have your hopes as high as mine were.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I was initially favorably impressed with the relatively easy setup and the playback of a number of YouTube videos. This device handles the older simpler videos on YouTube quite capably. However, when I tried to play the official YouTube video for When In Rome, &#34;The Promise&#34;, the Chromecast device simply did not have the adequate horsepower to launch the video after the advertisement.<br /><br />As a test, I then switched to my Chromebox, which is hooked up to my TV on another HDMI slot, and played the When In Rome video FLAWLESSLY. Well, you can't really compare a $35 Chromecast with a $400 Chromebox, as there obviously is a whole order of magnitude difference between these two platforms both on a technical and price dimension.<br /><br />I will take this device with me when on travel, and try it out on the TVs in the hotel rooms just to see how successful I am with the free Wifi that comes with the room. It's a cool gadget. I don't know how well it works with the Netflix and Hulu Plus apps, so you will have to read the other reviews for these options. Perhaps there will be a software upgrade in the future that will mitigate the specific issue I had with it.
B00746O3X8|5.0|I love to hike and take photograps. Carrying a heavy camera useing a neck strap for 5-10 miles or more always ends up with a neck/back/head ache. So I thoug I'll give the harness a try. Just came back from a 10 mile hike with no pain! It fits well (it can be adjusted very easy for your needs). I thought I'll use the side more them the front as I assumed that the chest piece would prevent me from seeing well the path in front of me. This wasn't the case and very comfortable too! I would recomand the harness to anybody that wants to bring a professional camera along on the hiking trail.
B005LAJ16I|4.0|The first season of Homeland is GREAT and the second is even better!!! Definitely a must watch. Sure, there are some things that are over the top and far fetched, but that is usually the case with T.V. and movies...it isn't supposed to be a documentary and does not make the claim that it is historically accurate, so I don't get what all the fuss in other reviews is about. Love how the main character has seemingly major mental issues, especially because this is something often ignored in mainstream T.V. Also, hilarious how many other people commented rather negatively here on the nudity/sexually explicit content and the fact that Homeland isn't a \\"family oriented\\" show...it's on Showtime people, not basic cable. I can only come to the conclusion that the people who are uncomfortable with the sex scenes, profanity, and other fun stuff Homeland includes are super duper insecure...just sayin'.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is not the first spider solitaire that I have played, but it is by far the best. I can spend hours playing. The graphics are great. It's not predictable like most games. I not only would recommend it to any one but I have recommended it to several friends and family members.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|Brad Pitt helps this movie move fast (along with the Zombies who are definitely not of the Walking Dead moper variety).  The premise is a bit weak as to how to defeat the threat.  The non-stop travel (Philadelphia to Korea without refueling? - I don't think so) And then Korea to Israel again without refueling -( I really don't think so).  But, overall an entertaining flick for in-flight amusement.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Started watching it  piece by piece and then got hooked.  Decided to start from the beginning and was delighted to<br />find it on Amazon Prime.

B00BFUUMO8|2.0|Looks good but its just too boring. Sure there's different dinasores but it doesn't connect to the movies as much as it should.
B000I62JBE|4.0|I really enjoy his movies. All but for a couple they are hooking you from the very beginning to the end.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Kik won't let me log in... and it's been doing it for a long time. Don't get it... it's a waste of storage space
B006FUUZBS|5.0|If you read just one of these, it is a must to read them all. They are that good. At least I think so
B00F35BV64|5.0|Each  one of the movies have been better than the last, the character of Spock and Jim are presented  very well
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great App! Love the wake to music feature. I can make a playlist and use it to wake up or go to sleep! I highly recommended this App.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I  love this is a bit of a year ago when the fox and roses the fox and roses the fox and roses the fox and roses the fox and time I don't know what the first time I don't think that the first time I don't to be the fox and time again in
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Waited for long time, ...don't like what I got.  Cannot transmit anything for more than 5-7 minutes.  After that the WiFi signal got killed and router need to be re-booted.  Absolutely no good help available, specially about my problem.  No help available via phone or email.  Maybe, I just got bad device and need to return.  As much as I want to have it, its waist of money now. How Google can offer product without good help?
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Great book. Bought the hard copy and love having it on Kindle too. Doris Goodwin keeps it interesting, the research is incredible . A good principle to keep your enemies close. They all (I think all of his cabinet ) came to respect him. If you love history you can never get enough of Lincoln's life. Did you ever wonder what Lincoln would do in this time we live in?
B007REV4T8|5.0|This is where the New James Bond Really begins, IMHO. I liked it. Nice introduction to new versions of old familiar characters.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Good story, lots of action, fun special effects, etc. Looks good in 3D as well. There were some rare occasions when objects that were very close to the camera appeared as a double image, but not distracting enough to be a problem. It may be how televised 3D operates, or it could be me. I have a Sony R550 model TV with Passive 3D glasses, which I understand is far less fatiguing than Active 3D glasses. I was able to sit through the entire movie without a break, and I was also wearing prescription glasses at the same time.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I don't usually like sequels.  It never meets the expectations of the original.  But, 'The King' did it again.  Absolutely the best book I have read this year and I read a lot.  I almost want to go to page 1 and start all over.  Of course, King did leave a little door open at the end.  It wouldn't be King if he didn't.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|This game is great fun. I love it, my kids love it, even my wife downloaded it. Some levels are quite difficult, but getting to watch the replays makes them all worthwhile.<br /><br />Sometimes we didn't even want to go back and do better on a level because we wanted to keep the replays with the funny crashes.<br /><br />My only suggestions for the Dev would be to make a way to save favorite replays, and to make one of the bonuses an automatic save on a really tough level. Like when you have a crash that would force you to start over, use your special to be able to continue on past it.<br /><br />I have not laughed so hard in a long time. Easily deserves 5 stars.<br /><br />Well done developer, well done.
B006OB3K56|5.0|This film was fantastic. The directing, the acting, the music, the story, and and so much more. I highly recommend it.
B001BKG9RQ|5.0|Love this album. I have always been a fan of Pink Floyd, mostly for the Dark Side of The Moon to Animals era. This is well recorded, and Sir David Gilmour plays really smooth guitar. Great music for either home listening or for the car, especially for a long road trip.
B00008BLB8|5.0|Flashback to 1975, with this tasty collection of favorite &#34;live&#34; recordings by GFR. Doesn't matter what some critics say. GFR was a great live band, in their day.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|It was a decent app before the new version came out. Now its so busy with all these adds and random useless junk that I can't even find what I need. I'm removing it ASAP.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love the movies, and the minions.  It's a lot of fun, suggest it to anyone.anything that deals with despicable me is great
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Some of the puzzles I found a little confusing - not entirely clear how they were supposed to work - but.overall this is a cute little hidden object game, and an amusing way to pass the time.
0765325950|5.0|loved it
B00F91H666|4.0|I read the book and this is nothing like the book but a very good story nonetheless. Non stop action, good acting, great special effect. The end is of course too optimistic but the movie was fun, not for the faint hearted, violent but not gruesome.
B008Y212PI|5.0|it is a rewarding and very fun game. it has a very unique concept. I like that you can pick how hard to make it.
B0036TGT2A|4.0|I bought the 3D version because it said it came with music rather than for the 3D-ness, but the music is a digital downloadable format and not a CD.  I found it hard to tell from the product description.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I really enjoyed Broadchurch as I'm fascinated with British TV right now.  The setting, the characters, the accent were all brilliant.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you liked: the movie War Games, Hackers<br />Play: Atari, Arcade Games<br />and know what an easter egg is, then you will love this book as much as i did!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Excellent product. When looking for after market items, as long I see the Anker brand I definitely buy it because I have never had a problem with this brand (trust me I have bought a few). I just got a new cell phone as well as I had a road trip coming up so I shopped for the new car charger so I could charge more than one item at the same time. Well I am now on my road trip and this product has been so awesome. Hubby and I can charge our cell phones at the same time or we can charge a cell phone as well as my son's tablet at the same time. And the charge is very fast, in no time your device is done charging.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|mine updated fine. it sometimes didn't save everything I did.  I really liked the game. Everytime I reached level 64 it would start me all over to pick a character. I had to delete this game. :(
B00AYB1KHW|2.0|a typical B movie. it was interesting to see elijah woods before lord of the rings. but otherwise it is a typical slasher movie of sorts,
1451695195|3.0|well for me it was just a review of everything I already know, but it was a good reminder.  it would be great for someone newer to metaphysical studies.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I've tried several Spider solitaire games.  So far this is the best.  It moves smoothly...is a good size...and keeps good stats.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|Amazing redition of one of the most timeless stories there is.  If you like Wicked at all, or the original Wizard of Oz, then you must add this to your collection!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book, like most women.  It's a great romantic story to ease us housewives out of our hectic days.  It helps picturing Charlie Hunnam as Christian as well!
B004CJB0CM|5.0|Haven't really had time to use it much - even tho' I've had it a while.  Hope to use it more in the near future.  It certainly has all that's needed for anyone looking to get in shape.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I don't read romance books but I liked this one. There were a couple times I was shocked which was great but I loved the detail of their love
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I have always liked Star Trek ever since first having seen the original series on TV way back when I was a kid. So, when J.J. Abrams made the first Star Trek reboot movie in 2009, I had some mixed feelings about it all. I thought that the movie could have been a lot better than it was, and that it should have also been something completely new and refreshing instead of playing around with already known and well-established characters as it did, but, at the same time, I had to admit that it was a much better movie than it's predecessor, Nemesis was. After a few more viewings though, the 2009 Star Trek really began to grow on me.<br /><br />Having said all of that, I really enjoyed Star Trek: Into Darkness and actually think that it is one of the best Star Trek movies ever made. I now look forward to seeing a third one in the series and I hope that all of the current original cast members return for at least one more adventure, and I also hope that it won't be as long of a wait as it was between the 2009 Star Trek and Into Darkness was.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Love this game play it every chance I get! Love the heros! love the skills and aspects! Love the PvP!
B0050DZ8J0|2.0|Don't waste your time. another way to have your private information used for others to see and use against you. Social networks have become a huge crutch for many. I am not one of them.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|A brief, easy to understand and very helpful book. And it's free! If you want to publish and have nothing more basic than MS Word on your computer, this book will help you get your manuscript ready to launch.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is lots of fun and super cute.  Looks good and works well on both my itouch and my kindle.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I don't have a lot of free time, but this game is pretty cool! The game is also very pretty and the music is relaxing, which is great compared to other games I've played.
0060555661|5.0|There are other excellent books on investments. But everything starts here, with Graham. All these other books must come after The Intelligent Investor.
B00498YZFK|5.0|I was not a big fan Lawrence until i watched this movie. Everything seems so real, it's like watching a documentary but not boring at all.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I absolutely love this I even bought the computer version too just can not explain how much I love it
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Moved a little slow at times. Not a great ending. Not one off Lee Child's best. Jack Reacher still great as always.<br />.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Not really scary in any way but a good read none the less. Great characters. It's good to see Danny again
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|They are made a tons of movie, they don't care if I give it 10 stars or no. It's the battle of stupid alien villains with marvel heros.
B008K6HN8I|1.0|The above says it all.  Not of any value. I repeat  &#34;Not of any value&#34;.  The Amazon needs to provide me with some recourse
B00004T9VY|5.0|A great example of the genius of Cat Stevens -- easy to understand why the original LP swent double Platinum.
B00F6NKFQK|5.0|I have time and again read this book in particular. Rather interesting sense of humor and wit, but I find it refreshing. Especially when I only get two minutes in between demands, with my kids pulling me this way and that.<br /><br />Looking forward to a sequel :)
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I seen pewdiepie play this and it looks so epic.I just wish it was like the one he plays.It is pretty fun though.
B0064W652A|4.0|Hush is one of those graphic novels that I've been hearing several people rave about for a while now, but never got around to reading it until today. Now that I have, I can see what the raving was all about.<br /><br />I loved it, and it feels very much in the vein of The Long Halloween, which has to be one of my favorite Batman novels ever (no surprise, given that Loeb wrote both). That however, is what cost this half a star in my rating - &#34;Hush&#34; the mystery manipulator behind the scenes in this book reminded me too much of &#34;Holiday&#34;. The story plays out very similarly as well, with the entire rogues gallery involved. I docked the title another half star for echoes of &#34;Under the Red Hood&#34; - yes, this is perhaps unfair because Red Hood came a couple of years after the publication of Hush, but together these two &#34;echoes&#34; just subtracted from the experience for me...<br /><br />That said, I greatly enjoyed the mystery, the twists and turns in the later issues, as well as the red herrings strewn along the way. Yes, there are plot holes, but I didn't care that much because the premise was so strong. Loeb really did live up to the hype in getting deep into Batman's head. The plot thread with Catwoman was just breathtakingly well realized. The Superman/ Batman clash was awesome as well (hopefully gets used for the B vs S movie!). Finally, the twin reveals at the end of who Hush was (which I saw coming at one point, but was delightfully thrown off the track of by red herrings later) as well as the 'other' shadowy villain of the piece were brilliant.<br /><br />I'd be remiss not to mention the fantastic artwork and additional covers included in this issue. Some of the panels are just, well, legendary. There were at least a few panels I want badly on a T shirt, and others I would blow up to wall sized and happily put up on a wall.
1400069742|5.0|Superb research and writing. An engrossing, intellectually satisfying book. Told me many things about the backstory  I'd not known about America's ultimate entry into the last good war.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|Interesting story line of roughly parallel worlds.  Excellent actors, but also being asked to play some whiny princess characters. Hence the drop from an all out excellent rating.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Great book! Had trouble putting it down. I just hope the movie is able to live up to the book.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|So emotional, so funny,  so sad, and so great!<br />This book is now at least in the top three. I strongly RECOMMEND THIS BOOK
B008Y212PI|4.0|When I first downloaded this app I did it because it was the free app of the day but when I read the reviews others I realised it was probably good since so many people were writing good reviews I tried it and instantly got the hang of it and I've been hooked ever since this is an awesome app and I encourage everyone to get it
1451695195|5.0|Absolutely a must read. A Harvard trained highly educated and kind doctor who openly and unabashed without prejudice shares with us his experience. I would give 10 stars!!!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Since the last update this app is horrible. It does not function properly. Loading issues on the news feed. Please fix the problems, it worked until the last update.
0061122416|4.0|THIS BOOK IS VERY INTERESTING AND I AM ENJOYING READING THIS BOOK. I LIKE TO READ AND THIS BOOK WAS SUGGESTED  TO ME TO READ.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|WELL FINALLY GOT A WINNER, THIS APPLICATION IS TERRIFFIC. It works great and my Kindle Fire HD works so much better since I installed this. Get it today, now, right away! User interface is wonderful and you don't have to be a computer programmer to use it.
B001BJNIIK|5.0|i never heard of this movie until my girlfriend told me about it and saw it.  I liked the movie so i purchased it.
B000MD9UJC|5.0|I had bought a LED AA Maglight.  I dropped it.  It was toast.  I decided to retro-fit my older (and more durable, I think) bulb-using AA Mini Mag instead.  Now, I have the flashlight I want.  It takes a little finessing/carefully forcing a couple of the pieces in place to get them to seat correctly.  When I first got the kit, I didn't get it in quite right and the top of the flashlight seemed to barely be holding on by a few threads.  I thought I'd wasted my money.  Then, thinking maybe I could get it to work if I cut down the leads for the LED just a little, I tried it again (without actually altering anything yet).  I got it right this time.<br /><br />The Mini Mag is turned on by twisting the top up, which turns it on and tightens the focus of the beam the more you turn.  The new setup comes with an optional replacement base with a pushbutton switch.  Use it or don't.  The twist method will still turn your light off and on.  Using the button only was an issue for me, but only because I wear it in a belt-sheath-thing. Sometimes something would bump the button through the fabric from below and turn it on. A twist on the top of the flashlight fixes that, so no worries.<br /><br />Good product.  Would definitely recommend.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|This has become the only keyboard I use.... It's fast, great response time, great layout and best keyboard you can get in my opinion
B008XG1X18|5.0|A wonderful source for finding the latest and greatest of your favorite things.  Have tried many recipes.  Great tips.  Thanks
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|I JUST did the update because I came to the app store to read reviews on talking angela, and too many ads for me to let my small grandson have without buying, so it is sad to advertise as free.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I've played various versions of this game since I was a teenager, and still love it. This version has some of the most beautifully detailed and clearly colored tiles I've seen. Very easy to see what's open, blocked, or doesn't match. Good way to pass time and just relax, while still having to think.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I hated this game. It was so short! After I played it for about a month, it wouldn't let me create a new world!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|A Great source for groups and staying in touch with family.  A bit annoying with the commercials and ads though.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If the thought of Jack Nicholson poking his head through a door and saying \\"Here's Johnny!\\" ever made you lose sleep at night, Doctor Sleep will continue that trend. The characters in this book and what they do will scare you but you can't put the book down until you finish it because you want to find out what kind of demonic shenanigans are coming next!!!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Great episode and use of special effects. It utilizes the entire cast in their pursuit of the bad guys. Great
B0046B3QTG|3.0|It is definitely for older children. My son is 4 1/2 and it was difficult for him to remain interested in the movie.
B00F99EMRE|5.0|Bass, guitar, drums and vocals are very clear and each note is much more pronounced, making the songs sound new. Even if you never listed to Vapor Trails, you'll love this album!
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|Unless your very persistent or a tech wiz you may not get far with this. You can look at the idea book for some help but using a mechanic to build the vehicle costs cold hard money. It doesn't even look like you can earn the free use of a mechanic, and the constant ads are pretty irritating.
B000I0XLYO|4.0|This is the goofyest movie I have ever seen. If you want to turn your brain off and just enjoy a movie this is the one. I hope you like it!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Action, adventure, friendship and brotherhood with just a touch of romantic interest make this a perfect read for teen boys - a difficult audience to reach.
B00E9P959O|5.0|Bass, guitar, drums and vocals are very clear and each note is much more pronounced, making the songs sound new. Even if you never listed to Vapor Trails, you'll love this album!
B000025J6A|5.0|I have been looking for Inside Star Trek on CD for years. It is great to hear Gene Roddenberry go over how Star Trek was created.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I don't know how they keep doing it, but this show gets better each year. I especially enjoy when they do a random comedic episode to take a break from the delicious drama.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|This is not like the movie.  Book was lame.  I didn't like it, others may.  It is a collection of stories.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Clean master is truly the master at keeping all those megabytes bitten.  It fees up space quickly.  What more could one require
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Especially enjoyed the epilogue. The book had me guessing through most of it. Hooked through to the end. Looking to forward to reading more of her stories.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Its mindless silliness and just a fun game that will not frustrate you like candy crush or any other endless level app. Besides, its about time they developed a game from the very funny saftey video released a while back... good times lol
B00FGFVMGA|2.0|Great game when you can get it to load.  I too have the 8.9 HD fire and when starting the app, 95%  I get<br /><br />a run time error message. Please address as soon as possible.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Enjoyed the series very much until they added all the unnecessary rough language & infidelity...the story line was great without it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great! Easy to set up.  Easy to use.  I use it for my online classes.  Can move around the room instead of being stuck in front of the computer
B00A8ECU24|3.0|it would be a lot better if it were easier to earn the gems in the game. Or  if all the ponies and /houses/ shops could be earned with just coins. I personally have a problem with the game not loading my friends list. Then crashing.
0812982622|4.0|Very interesting and readable book.  I knew nothing of what life might be like in North Korea before I read this.  The book is at times funny in its frank use of propoganda by the &#34;Dear Leader.&#34;  It is also dark and could have been much bleaker had the writer  been so inclined.  I felt that the interrogator character was not realistic.  But that is nitpicking.  I highly recommend this book!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I have always enjoyed this app.  Either on my smartphone or kindle fire hd, and have had no problems.  Always instant weather.  Thanks
B000FCK65W|4.0|Very good I've enjoyed reading this book. I like reading about this period in our time. Good read. What's next?
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|Best game ever<br />For. My best friend s to play<br />And we can play together<br />I love this game<br />And all ways will
B0089LOG02|2.0|This book came very highly recommended. I guess my taste is different. I was disappointed. I felt it was disjointed
B00594XOZU|1.0|Im really upset because the app with not let me log in- it tells that its taking longer than it should, try again in a little bit- please fix this :( i miss using kik on my kindle fire hd(:
B000PKX2KA|5.0|Purchased this receiver to replace the cheap and barely functional receiver that came with Microsoft Streets and Trips.  This receiver works great.  Most days it acquires satellite signals within 3 or 4 seconds; the longest it has ever taken is about 10 seconds.  My laptop is mounted in my vehicle and I use the GPS function daily.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have always been a king fan, it has been awhile since I have read one of his books and thought a sequel to the shinning would be interesting. I liked how it made reference to the shinning but had its own individual story and didn't need to rely heavily on the original plot of the shinning. If you are hoping that it picked up with the original story you will be disappointed, if you keep an open mind that this is an entirely different book that only hints at the shinning you will be interested. Even if you didn't read the shinning there is still enough info her to draw you in without getting you lost. All in all a good read.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Great read......I now understand why people can't stop talking about the TV version!<br />Can't wait to see these characters come to life in the screen.
B009MF5BXK|4.0|We both enjoyed this more than we thought we would.  Some of the actors are getting older and we<br />were surprised to see how well they endured the painful scenes.
B00ARN0ZF0|2.0|I enjoyed the previous Paranormal Activity movies quite a bit, so I was bummed when I heard that PA4 was a dud.  I finally got around to watching it for myself today, hoping that it was much better than reviews and word of mouth had advised.  It wasn't.  It isn't.  It's finely acted and the characters are likeable for sure.  The movie's primary failure is that it's mind numbingly boring.  It's a 90 minute movie that felt too long by 15 to 20 minutes.  Nothing happens forever.  And when things do happen, they don't always make a lot of sense.  Why'd the knife fall in front of the dad?  Why'd the girl levitate over the bed?  And the movie squanders what might've been a decent plot twist.  All along there are hints that the mom was complicit with Katie.  Turns out she wasn't at all.  So all those hints were just what, put in there accidentally?  Hmm.<br /><br />Anyway, if you've seen the first three movies and enjoyed them, there's nothing worth seeing in this flick that can't be discovered in much less time by reading a plot summary online.  Don't watch this snooze fest.
B00ESF2772|5.0|Fox in Socks<br /> has been my favorite book since before I can remember.  My kids my be in high school and college, but I downloaded this book to my kindle so I can always have it with me.  You never know when you might come across a young kid who just might need a Fox in Socks read.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is fun and addictive. I play it to pass the time and it is very enjoyable. Great game.
B001TODCII|3.0|He liked this one very much.  It was he, who wanted me to order it in the first place. He liked it a lot.
B005LAIIGW|5.0|Gravity is without a doubt one of the single most impressive space films ever made. Alfonso Cuarón's skills as a writer and director are used to their fullest. Not since the likes of \\"2001 A Space Odyssey\\" or \\"Apollo 13\\" has any film taken us into the cold quiet reaches of space quite like this and stranded us there with such insurmountable odds of survival.
B004SZHIR6|1.0|I have no idea why this one disk will not play on my Sony Blue Ray Player - as all others do. There should be a warning listed on the product or there should be a reason given as to why. This version will load the initial logo for JustBridge and then crashes on the player. Maybe this has to do with the specific version that clearly is written in german on the back and makes no note of this in the ad for the product.
B005LAIIGM|5.0|This movie is the reason why 3D movies exist. The experience is beyond unthinkable in 3D, but the energy of the film can still be captured without it.<br />I saw it on Imax 3D with my wife and we both could not stop looking at each other with a wow face. $100 million dollars to make such a powerful film and so far $17.5 million on their release night. The movie is a must watch and I cannot wait for the Super Crazy Awesome HD 3D Blu Ray edition to come out because I need this in my collection.<br /><br />Please go watch such an amazing film. Sandra and George are incredible and they seriously need to be praised for such great acting.
B005LAII3A|3.0|I can't believe that I've resisted this film so long. Having held Arnie's so close to my heart for so long, a remake is almost impossible to avoid.<br />The moment I saw it, I thought of BladeRunner and even at the end I had Star Wars and Aliens in mind. The sets are derivative.<br />Having said that, it takes off running and never stops. I liked it a lot and it edges out Arnie's by a hair, action-wise, that is. The downside is that Kate Beckinsale delivers her usual slam bang, monochromatic, breathless performance. She could have swallowed as many flies as she uttered the word \\"S***.\\"<br />Jessica Biel, on the other hand, delivers a slam bang, monochromatic, breathless performance. In fact, the two are all but indistinguishable in their breathlessness. Still, Colin Farrell really saves it.<br />Having just watched the \\"Making of Avatar\\" I was more aware of the special effects. They are stunning and I wish, now, I had watched it on the big screen.<br />I wonder, however, how it might have been with Hauser actually dying. That's where I would have cut it.<br />Good stuff, all the same.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Love reading this novel  Ken Follett brings you into the lives of those who formed the world stage from those who lived during the times that led up to the World Wars.
0793563836|5.0|Very comprehensive, my son and his music teacher using this as tutorial for his beginning to intermediate bass lessons.  Decent value.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Everything was great in this book I loved it I love the way he described in detail what went on inside
B000XUBC5E|5.0|This is the second novel I have read by this author and have to admit, I am hooked. I was expecting the typical all is well ending, but with the twists and turns given it made it more desirable to read and unable to put the book down. It is a must read and I look forward to reading more from this author.
B004LP3AYI|1.0|Terrible.  I gave the series/author another shot after the first book beacuse the plot, though straightforward and predictable, was solid enough.  I figured Goodkind would develop his writing style past an 8th grader's comprehension level, but I was wrong.  Made it about 1/2 way through this one before just putting it down.  Try &#34;The Way of Kings&#34; if you're looking for a solid fantasy epic.
B005F9TQBU|5.0|This recording shows the range of Carlos Santana's genius as an composer and arranger along with talent as a musician!!!
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Not a complex app but just a little note pad. You could keep it on your phone or Kindle for quick reference.  I have one list of important phone numbers and acct numbers (like car insurance).  Can also use for grocery lists, birthday lists, etc.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|It's pretty funny on some parts, and rather melodramatic at other parts.  I think it is worth watching once, but not if you like scary zombie horror films, this is deffinitely not one of those scary films.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Great game. Tons of fun. Lots of levels and options. Definitely recommend! Easy to use and fun for all ages as difficult can be adjusted. Ideal for the puzzle lover!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book not only met my expectations in the sense of the \\"boy pursues girl to a perfect fault\\", but it has a pleasantly planned story that I would have never guessed!
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|This book was so funny because of the weird things that happens in the story that is why I love  it
B00EIR5N9O|2.0|It's of course a great modernist novel. The edition contains missing words at a passage. (For example, first paragraph of section 7, Part 2). I wonder whether there are some more words missing.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book takes you step by step through practical processes to open you to all that the Universe has to offer! thank you!
B003QS67F0|5.0|Just an excellent movie...plot,characterization,setting all work well together. Very good acting as well! A fine cast,that worked vry well together.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I would recommend this great book to anyone who likes adventure and or mythology. Also check out his other books
B008Y212PI|4.0|Never played this type of game but surprisingly it's fun. It's challenging enough to keep you occupied but not too hard that you spent a great amount of time on one game. Game worked well on my Kindle Fire HD. No problems downloading. Would've given it a five but don't like the fact that they force you to give a review for the bonus round. Would recommend it to others.
B00AEBBA36|5.0|Very good movie, Some of the best work by Elliott and Gibson. Elliott does a masterful job as CSM as did Gibson.
B000HL0EEE|5.0|I never had the chance to see all of the episodes of Star Trek: Enterprise. It was great to see how some of the tools and technology was envisioned prior to its finished product in the Star Trek series and the other movies and shows which followed.<br /><br />Great stuff!
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I love the movie it was awesome,what else can I say but buy it,you wont regret it,The 3D was great.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|She loved it and watches it all the time. We will definitely consider buying another film from all of you.
B000VDUWMC|5.0|The book as a whole was good, but I'll focus on what I think was the best part of the book: It was his synopsis at the end (because it is strong enough to stand alone as a real book). That part of the book brought up some of the key issues in trying to offer a scientific treatment of history (1) and it could be expanded into a book on its own (2).<br /><br />His point in that section was that history as a science was not feasible because of differences in:<br /><br />1. Methodology;<br />2. Complexity;<br />3. Causation;<br />4. Prediction;<br /><br />vis a vis other disciplines<br /><br />The thesis of the book itself was great, and I'd recommend that someone read &#34;The 10,000 year Explosion&#34; by Cochran and Harpending as an upgrade/ counterpoint to Diamond's work.<br /><br />As a testament to the enduring popularity of the book, it has gone through several reprints and been translated into several different languages.<br /><br />Verdict: Worth the time and worth the money (especially at the second hand price of a paperback).
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|When everywhere else was selling this at $40 or so, I got it for half. That is a bargain and I love bargains. It's great addition to the others in the series.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Day-Lewis did a magnificent job. The acting was superb. I have read &#34;A Team of Rivals&#34; and was very impressed by the movie version of the fight to  ratify the 13th amendment.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|Raiders is, of course, a classic of the genre -- one of the first movies I'm aware of where, by the end, the hero looks like he's been through an action movie. The bundle loses a star for the subsequent downslide, though.
B00FEN1C50|5.0|I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in a long time. It was everything I have wanted from a giant movie. It took all the best parts of my childhood and rolled them into one awesome film. Some have complained about lack of characterization (not true in my opinion) or lack of plot. (Also not true.) What it is is that some people won't get a movie about giant robots punching giant monsters. If that doesn't at all appeal to you, then this might not be your movie. But if it does, then you won't find it this awesome anywhere else. I had to see it four times in the theater.
B008476HBM|5.0|Good book. It is a book  that will also improve your vocabulary. I enjoyed. A couple of slow places. One can learn something about themselves while reading.
B0016OVEYA|4.0|A fun B-movie with an A-movie's special effects budget (given the time -- they'd be much better now for the same budget). I thought it hit both Verhoeven's and Heinlein's themes on propaganda pretty well.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Love this game! Had some issues with the app force closing on my phone (Droid 3)....even with that happening after finishing each puzzle, I still love this game!
B0019N8P2W|3.0|I love the series...my only problem would be my packaging.  The inside piece was broken so now my DVDs are susceptible to being scratched.  Other than that, love Daria as an animated series. Used to watch faithfully on MTV
0062255657|5.0|It may be kind of short, but it's been on my mind since I've read it.  Got it when it first came out and still have images in my mind.  Love Neil Gaiman.  I love this book.
B005HED08I|5.0|Always fun to go back in time and watch the original series!  I have enjoyed the Star Trek universe sine I was a kid. This remastered addition is really cool to watch!
B007EECSFA|5.0|And the secrets keep coming - right till the last page. Fantastic. This was my first Kate Morton book and now I've become a fan.
B008Y212PI|4.0|A nice way to spend a few extra moments. The game gets you thinking, but is not so challenging that it gets you frustrated. When you want more of a challenge, you can try the harder levels.
B00E7SFAAG|3.0|Runs smoothly on my note 2, nothing out of this world about the game but I do have a complain... the music is like being trapped on an elevator same music all the time.
B008Y212PI|5.0|OK. So this just might be my new favorite game. I can't seem to put it down. I also like how it keeps me thinking - keeps my brain active. Yay!
B0089LOG02|4.0|The Orphan Train was a good read.  I viewed it as a fictional story of children who were abandoned and then placed into homes without love for reasons of convenience and their strength to survive.  Although I viewed it as fictional, I believe it under portrayed the realities of the times and the treatment of children without families to care for them.
B0063M22QO|3.0|It always lets me go back and play so far, but always acts like it's gonna lock me out of it someday because I don't get the next more advanced version when I've won every level. Always best with the sound down.
158270208X|5.0|This book has changed my life! It has become my &#34;Worry Log.&#34; I write it in EVERY MORNING! I simply give up all worry to this journal - and low, and behold - all the right things happen! I started the first one 18 months ago and have almost completed my FIFTH Gratitude Book. It is a life changer.
B007MDB71O|5.0|This movie was perfectly aligned to the hard cover books I had - made the stories come alive.<br /><br />Well done....
B00ET47USI|4.0|I like the little guys and the way all the animation jumps around on it and get a kick out of the little sounds it makes. I also like the way you can tap the cards and they go where they continue the sequence or to an empty space until they can't anymore. But I still can't figure out why they call it Spider solitare.
B00EE3FTNM|4.0|I really loved Season 1 of Broadchurch for so many reasons--photography, acting, scenery, story line, suspense, cast of characters, and the fact that it's so bloody different from the crud (I cut my cable some 5 years ago) on regular TV.<br /><br />Overall, parts of Broadchurch reminded me of Season 3 of The Killing on AMC and that's not a bad thing.<br /><br />What surprised me, and maybe that was their plan as a UK show brought to the US, is this wasn't a &#34;who did it?&#34; mystery with clues sprinkled in every episode so we, the viewers, could solve the crime.<br /><br />Really look forward to Season 2 and curious what the Fox version will be like.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Enjoy the levels. Addicting game. Lots of fun. Playing it every day. Can't stop. Best game since sudoku. Very good. Worth while.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|It never did work right. I'm not really sure why. It acts like it's incompatible with my kindle. Very strange.
B000JCSPG0|5.0|Great and unusual story line with tons of action and a fair amount of emotional engagement.  Well done cast and crew.
0345803493|4.0|I found book #1 pretty dull. A friend told me that book #2 is way better. It is. There is more depth to the story, and even a little mystery in book #2. :)
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The whole book was a wonderful story of survival intertwined with animals- which i love- I just thought that the whole thing was awe inspiring
B008QTVNUI|2.0|The main character played by Claire Danes is too much of a freak, and the whole concept of a drama glorifying the American Gestapo is so repulsive that I can't even give it a fair watch.

B000FA5TTW|4.0|A compassionately written book about a very tough subject. I never would have believed I could say I enjoyed a story like this but I thoroughly did.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book and all its twists and turns and realized that I had pre-judged the book a little just because of the title. I don't like things to be 'hopeless', but the book revealed that I had made an unnecessary assumption! The characters are to be very much admired, so readers please don't make the mistake I made and keep on reading this very admirable book. You will be very entertained as you read on and very surprised as this unforgettable story unfolds.
B001F5M9MG|1.0|DID NOT DOWN LOAD BUT 3 SONGS AND I KNOW IT HAS MORE THAN THAT JUST HATE HAVING TO GO BACK TO GET WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE
B00FEN1C50|4.0|I think they should have given a better explanation of the 'rift', at the beginning of the movie, not the end.  And why such a weak hero, next to the tall, dark, handsome man?  He was just a big mouth and you couldn't see him very well.  I thought the action scenes were well performed, couldn't a missile take them out better?  It would have been a MUCH BETTER film; without the tall, dark, handsome man in it, who added nothing, but an antagonistic attitude.  I couldn't figure out if the movie was about him or the monsters. ???  Poorly scripted.  But, they got the actions scenes down pat.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I'm probably too old to read this book....30's.  I loved it though.  It was an easy read and one that stuck with me for a while after I read it
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Many twists and turns kept my interest in this novel.  Although I figured out the resolution 3/4 through the novel, it was still a captivating novel with interesting characters.
159463176X|5.0|[[ASIN:159463176X And the Mountains Echoed]] begins with a brother and sister walking through the Afghan desert with their father. Their father tells them a story about a div, a type of ogre in Afghan lore who stole children from their homes. If parents had more than one child, they were forced to choose one child to sacrifice to the div. Everyone assumed that the div stole the children to eat them, but as their baba weaves his tale, Abdullah and his little sister Pari realize that not everything is always as it seems. The siblings, bonded by heartbreaking circumstances, also soon come to understand that the story has more connection to their lives than they thought.<br /><br />As events transpire that tragically separate Abdullah and Pari, Hosseini's narrative spans onward and outward to follow the lives of the relatives, neighbors, caretakers, and ancestors who are affected by one father's choice. This multigenerational novel is a study of the choices we make, the chances we take (or don't take), and ultimately, the love that redeems us.<br /><br />I'm still wiping tears from my eyes after reading the novel's heartbreaking (and perfect) conclusion, but I'll try my best to write about it coherently. It's hard not to compare [[ASIN:159463176X And the Mountains Echoed]] to Hosseini's previous novels ([[ASIN:1594480001 The Kite Runner]] and [[ASIN:159448385X A Thousand Splendid Suns]]), since those novels were masterpieces. While I don't think [[ASIN:159463176X And the Mountains Echoed]] was quite as affecting and groundbreaking as those previous works (oops, sorry; that's the only comparison I'll make!), it's still a brilliant novel in its own right. The way Hosseini organizes the narrative is nothing short of genius; he's essentially created building blocks out of words in the sense that, even if each chapter's connection to the overall theme isn't immediately clear, it will be in due time. Each chapter is told in a different character's voice, and it's remarkable how thoroughly Hosseini gets inside his characters' heads and revels them to the reader. Because of the way the narrative is structured, the book's \\"main\\" characters are revealed to the reader from multiple perspectives. It's genius.<br /><br />The book is gorgeously written, of course (it is Khaled Hosseini, after all!), and filled with stunning imagery (a pair of yellow shoes that change the course of a slew of lives; broken eyeglasses discovered in an orchard; sunlight reflecting off a piece of glass and onto an old woman's hands). The reader gets the sense that not a single word is wasted. Every sentence of this book has a purpose. In the section that I initially thought had the smallest connection to the rest of the story, Hosseini writes: \\"If I've learned anything in Kabul, it is that human behavior is messy and unpredictable and unconcerned with convenient symmetries. But I find comfort in it, in the idea of a pattern, of a narrative of my life taking shape, like a photograph in a darkroom, a story that slowly emerges and affirms the good I have always wanted to see in myself. It sustains me, this story.\\" As I read this, suddenly the chapter that I thought was least meaningful became the MOST meaningful chapter. I think this paragraph reveals the very thing Hosseini wanted to accomplish with this novel: a narrative slowly taking shape, a symmetry emerging, goodness prevailing within the messiness of humanity. And he definitely accomplished this, and more, with this heartbreaking, beautiful, and emotionally complex novel.
B009G41CG2|5.0|I love a challenge, and this game keeps me on my toes! Anyone who likes puzzles will love this mahjong game!
0547258305|1.0|I thought it was a good book to start with but for some reason authors of books that are obviously intended for young teens are determined to make their characters sexually active.  The part where it happens is short and undetailed but you know it happens and it killed the romance.  Sex is over encouraged in our society and it's a crying shame that one can't find an interesting story that doesn't contain it.  Authors please stop choking it down the throats of young readers and killing pure true love!
0694003611|5.0|This is my favorite book that our grand kids go to over and over to hear the simple words and search for the little mouse. Well done, especially in the board book.
B00ENTDDGW|4.0|I like it. The paddles stick sometimes and I wish u could change the looks of them but it's fun. I like to play another person.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|The game is fun but there are many glitches. Today I had 4 bingos and lost them all due to a glitch. Powerups gone, chests gone, credits gone, money gone.<br /><br />Tonight I have been knocked out of the game three times, again losing all.<br /><br />Would rate it much higher if they could fix the problems.
B00633W614|5.0|Great book. The second book in ARcher's trilogy . Couldnt leave it and red it start to finish in one day.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Awesome game, graphics and easy to play. I am still getting used to it. I am not a gamer anyone but I was playing this game.
B005FDWM6M|5.0|Great family movie, every one will enjoy this heart warming film. It shows the most beautiful feelings between a daughter and her<br />parents and the incredible faith and resilience this of a child. This movie also invites you to see how one person make a difference<br />in so many lives.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|It was ok. Some of the story did not really fit together well. Things happen that make little to no sense. The beginning was the best part.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I am very happy with how they are integrating the old series into a new universe...looking forward to the next one!
B0027MJU00|5.0|This was a crazy good book that left me not knowing the killer until the end & I am normally good at figuring them out!!
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|The book was shared with me in an overview status by a client we support. He has built a good team and is always looking to improve the teams production.<br />He talked about the value in time blocking and the book brought it to life.

B001U3Y5XE|1.0|My 5 year old asked my 7 year old &#34;why arent the pictures on the cards made out of LEGO shapes?&#34;. With all the many pieces we have at home, we can easily play this game without the &#34;LEGO Creationary&#34; box - and my pieces will create better results. All in all we just didnt get it. Take heed, do not purchase this box of nothings.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|This book is kinda like you get what you pay for deals.<br />That's why I give it five stars some people should've new by the description (which wasn't a very good one though.) That it would have a lot of filler in it it's what the book was made for and to me it had intense moments granted the ending wasn't the spectacular one I was hoping for I still enjoyed the book non the less I recommend it if you don't mine long detailed moments throughout the book.
B008JJM88Q|3.0|The only thing that I can complain about this app is that when you answer questions and the genie gets it wrong the game stops and brings to the home screen. But besides that I enjoy the game and find it entertaining. The first time I played it it creeper me out because it got almost everything right

B00DWZHTRW|5.0|I heard different things about this movie. It seemed to shoot in and out of theaters quickly and was not advertised a huge amount.<br /><br />Once it came out on Blu I waited a little and once the used price dropped I picked it up and I am so glad I did. The PQ and AQ are outstanding and the over-all flow, cinematography and soundtrack of this movie are very well done.<br /><br />One thing about this movie is that you need to pay attention to all the little details because in the end everything adds up to making the ending equate to a semi-logical situation. There are many parts which defy realism and common sense, however you need to push that aside and simply enjoy the movie.<br /><br />Now You See Me has an amazing cast and somehow they all work perfectly together in every way shape and form. Some were saying that there was not a lot of character development with the magicians, however this movie is not about the magicians, it's about the chase and trying to find them.<br /><br />In 2013 there were only a few movies which stood out to me. World War Z, This is the End and Now You See Me. There are so many movies which are just fluff and don't seem to have it together. Now You See Me was a great fun movie and I highly recommend checking it out.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|no review at this time I'm not in the mood for this at this time is that all right with you.
B00B19G01C|4.0|Good solid horror/scary movie.  Not a slasher, more along the lines of The Exorcist which is still the best horror movie of all time to me.
B009AY04A8|5.0|I like the game very much. Been nice if the characters had animated voices, but other than that good story line and intriguing.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|This movies was really ridiculously far fetched.  Had high hopes, but it flew to close to the sun and got scorched.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|I Got this cd for my dad and he loves it !!!! So as long as he's happy I'm happy 5 stars !!!
B00DU74U74|1.0|Don't buy this movie. Obviously a cheap rip-off of other sci-fi alien inspired flicks gone wrong. Reminded me of a Sci-fi channel movie that was not worthy. Save the money and rent something that captivates the senses ans makes you go &#34;wow, that was a great movie.&#34; This was more of an inspiration to go to bed early.
B000099T2L|5.0|I can listen to beyonce over and over and over, all day long. She is incredible and never gets old in my humble opinion. Amazing.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Loved the series! The actors are very good and I love anything British and historical.  I wish there wereore seasons.
B002QY9RMA|5.0|Beyonce is amazing. I don't think she is capable of producing anything poorly. SHe always give it her all. Amazing as always.
B0094M2ITG|4.0|I watched on the Kindle Fire while lying in bed one night, good story and well done I thought. It has a great cast and was well acted and I will watch again.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I have had it on my Galaxy Note for several days and probably played it 10 times or more--like during TV ads, or when my mind was too busy at night and I couldn't sleep. There are so many different patterns to match up that it really keeps you on your toes trying to notice 2 of the same, and I also like the bright, cheerful colors.<br /><br />That said, it is kind of a brainless game because all you do is click on any two little squares (all right, cubes!) with an identical pattern and then they are blown away. The object is to get rid of the entire big cube. You can easily rotate the whole thing to get at newly-revealed cubes further inside it, or to get a side with more pairing possibilities. It's probably good exercise for your eyes and reaction time.<br /><br />My only dissatisfaction with the game is that if you wait until the end, you can't make out your score because the screen overlay prompting you to post the results for your friends to see grays it out. If you want to know your score, you have to take time from playing the game to check the time up to the left (which is constantly changing) of the screen and your actual score up to the right. That makes you less likely to get a high score. But not to worry!  If you play the simplest form of the game, you can at least ALWAYS finish it. Not so if playing in \\"attack' mode.
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|We waited a long time for this sequel to &#34;The Shining&#34;.  A powerful and moving tale by the master of storytelling himself.  Thank you, Mr King.  As always, you kept me reading right up to the last page.

B00AIQP9DE|4.0|The game is good, great story, good graphics and all, but $4.99 is just TOO MUCH! also, it's a short game! And no bonus chapter! For $4.99, it should be longer, with a bonus chapter of . Play!!

B00FEHXCIG|2.0|Could've been better. Kinda disappointed with the movie. Very weak storyline. Just relied on special effects to get people to watch it all the way through and it worked. Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrows acting was lukewarm to me. Iron Man has anxiety issues in this. The person who you think is the bad guy... yeah disapointed indeed.
B00B4FU6KE|4.0|No spoilers here...don't read anything in advance. Fortunately I had forgotten Barbara Kingsolver's glowing review when I got back to this book on my kindle.  Starts a bit slowly but huge twist in Part 2. Fascinating. Good book group choice,
B001NLKWLW|4.0|One the first books in a long time that I've had a hard time putting down; well written intriguing story.
B00DKY4LBW|1.0|At a small gig with 150 people in the So Cal desert post Humbug, the band ranked up there with the best shows I have ever seen lifetime.  Three years, two more Arctic Monkeys shows and two albums later we get this present product.  I liked 13 songs on the first album, 11 songs on the second, 6 on the third and 1 each on the fourth and the fifth album.  The band has reached a dead end musically and the energy levels appear to be on life support.  Moving from the UK to LA is definitely not going to help this bunch.<br /><br />Music reviewers claim that \\"the band has changed their approach musically to every single album.\\"  Yes and realtors call unliveable shacks \\"charming fixer-uppers with great location\\"<br /><br />Chuck D once said, \\"Don't..Don't,,,Don't believe the hype!\\"<br /><br />I had been hoping that the aptly named Suck It and See was an artistic aberration due to commercialization pressures in the band.  What the heck was that Shalala song anyway?  But unfortunately it wasn't.<br /><br />It's over.  Great while it lasted but its definitely over.
B002NJWHHA|5.0|I love the dragon if is could i would have one. But i will tell everyone about your renting movies.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|This is a TERRIFIC movie!  My teenage daughter and I really loved it.  I feel bad that it did not do well at the box office -- it was a brave, bold film.  It is downright fascinating to see the core group of actors play so many different roles, crossing both gender and racial lines.  Cloud Atlas is a clever and beautiful movie that I will watch many times over!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love Facebook One way of getting in touch or glimpse of family and friends all over the world :) I give it 5 stars
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This cast has a fantastic chemistry and the director does honor to what Gene Rodenberry created. This movie is intense and action packed. The special effects are phenomenal. The story is wonderful and rife with a plot that keeps you guessing. Great job!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|she loves decorating the horses and washing and caring for them I even get to help her with races she doesn't always win but knows that she can try harder!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I gave this show five stars because, despite a bit of over-acting and predictable script, the storyline keeps you engaged.
B00594XOZU|4.0|Kik has always been GREAT for me, especially since I don't have a phone and all my friend have kik. It's great bc it's fast, it sends u a notification, u can send ppl picture messages, etc.<br /><br />However, there's some things I DON'T like.<br /><br />1. U can't log in and out without restarting your conversations.<br /><br />2. ( BIGGEST ISSUE) U DO NOT have image search, which is really fun to use for sending images to ppl. U also cannot send videos, files or whatever. This is for IPHONES, ANDROIDS, ETC. ONLY!!<br /><br />3. On an iPhone, u can change your info, for example, your name, email. . .etc. On a kindle fire though, you CAN'T. The only setting option u can do is your profile picture.......!<br /><br />That's all for today, like it up so ppl can see this, especially AMAZON. I really hope they fix these problems, especially the not having IMAGE SEARCH, videos, ETC!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Not as good as \\"classic\\" Stephen King legendary stories, but you do disappear on a pleasurable long journey into Kingland.<br />You either like his long meandering storytelling or you don't.<br />This book stands on its own, even though the author tries very hard to make it a sequel.
B00EOO55GW|4.0|Good CD from start to finish.  Sounds very much like the Nightmare album.  I was glad they continue with their sound rather than Try something completely different.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Once you pick up the rules its lots of fun ! I play it alone and with my 6 year old son.
B00E7SFAAG|2.0|If you make a perfect move it messes you up the little robber always gets a head start and then you lose
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love logic puzzles but sometimes they are time consuming. This is a nice compromise. I have finished the 10x10 square level, so now I will start the 15x15 square puzzles.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I haven't found anything wrong with it. It saves my notes in a nice and clean way so I can find them again. It's perfect for writing stories in, and you can do so much more than that with it too.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Loved every part One of my favorite books and a good family or class read anyone would love this KEEP WRITING RICK!!!!!
0688158234|5.0|Giving in to a friend's suggestion I read this book, I was amazed at this woman's story and learned so much about her country and culture. her story was compelling, as well as, unnerving at many times. She was a survivor and her story is worth the read.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I knew Tina Fey was an SNL writer, that she nailed the Sarah Palin impersonation and sometimes I saw her on Weekened Update. However, I probably heard more about how funny and important she is to comedy than anything else.<br /><br />Can I say, great biography? Great biography. Fey details her parents, high school, boyfriends (lack thereof), and an aimless YMCA job after college. It's a fascinating telling of a normal life before the stardom. She's plainly honest.<br /><br />Her improv skills are prominently on display. It's a book, I know, but it's evident she's quick-witted in the words. She lets loose vitriol in profane statements that had me cringing and laughing. Her observations about women in the workplace are sharp and unapologetic. After reading about the continuous late night writing sessions, it makes SNL and showbiz sound like hell. I'm glad someone is doing it for me.<br /><br />While she chronicles her career, she reveals the personal aspects of being a mother and the thoughts about what that means, what she'd do different, what she'll do next. All in all, a great insight into the life and career of a successful comedy writer.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game!<br />Pros:<br />Different settings<br />Battles with the villains<br />Awesome obstacles ( rockets, saws, lasers,)<br />And power ups!!<br /><br />Cons<br />The costumes cost too much.<br />There should be another way to get those tokens.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Walt is exactly what law enforcement should be today but isn't.  Great story the tv series does not do it justice, great read<br />Maybe the Barney Fife's out there wil learn something about treating people?
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Wasn't sure if my tv would play 3D as I have a 3D disc player and an LED monitor.  So I thought I'd pay a little extra for 3D to see.  It was only $24.95 as opposed to $19.95.  The answer is no.  If you have a LED monitor it will not play 3D.  Loved the movie.  This is better than the first they came out with.  We watched it once but it is so action packed we'll have to watch it again tomorrow. Great story line.  The surround sound is awesome.  The Digital HD is breathtaking.  You think you are at the movie house in your own home. Well worth the investment.  We will watch this one again and again.  A must see for Star Trek enthusiasts even though it doesn't follow the original Story series 100%.  It's fun and they have done a great job of screencasting.  The bad guy plays Sherlock on PBS.  He does an awesome job.
B00DFFI7K2|4.0|Was not as good as the first one, did not really like the story line, and slow in spot's.  However it is still worth watching, and very intertaining, With some interesting twist's and turn's. All in all, A good movie!
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Action right from the start. Fast moving. But.....the start of of movie gave no explanation of what was going on. Then the end left you not knowing how it happened. It was an &#34;OK&#34; movie. I was disappointed. Another problem I had was with the die loafing from Amazon. The movie keep pausing then if was our of sync. At times I had to stop, pause and rewind. That was frustrating.
B0036TGT2A|5.0|This just arrived, the family loves it.  The crabby-oki isn't that great because the words are hard to read, but the movie quality is great, better than the DVD we had previously.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I enjoy playing Mahjong. This game has attractive tiles. The controls are easy to understand. So far I've had no problems with the functions.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Loved the book, it moved quickly, and quite the page turner. I did get confused at first as to who all the characters were.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|I would love to know how to get rid of the darn ad's. The have is fun however after each game you have to sit through a commercial. Annoying.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Almost from the start, this movie hits the ground running, literally.  In that regard, World War Z resembles most other treks into this genre, in that we enter the the story at the point where the disease begins to impact humanity--it does this fast, fast fast...  No real surprise there.  The only shortcoming I can see in this movie is, in its desire to keep momentum, it cuts out what I call lead-ins, the &#34;back stories&#34; or the build-ups.  What I mean is, you see a grouping of navy ships in the ocean--no zombies anywhere and all is settled.  I wouldn't have minded seeing the ships going through a sort-out--assume the virus is airborne, so some of the crews would be affected.  Perhaps show the ships desperately leaving port, booting angry zombies over the sides and with only partial crews left--in other words, show the struggle--show the lead-ins, the build-ups.  They did this a little bit with the Israel segments--a little--so that portion of the film worked better for me--show the lead-ins...  Overall, I give this film 5 stars because it does keep the viewer engaged from start to end.  Brad Pitt and the rest of the cast did an exceptional job.  The zombies are crazy scary--fast and darned angry--really angry.  Well, wouldn't you be angry if mother nature did that to you?  I'm now interested in the book.  I hope the book has the lead-ins.
0375416811|4.0|lovely funny storry, well read. Perfect performance by I love listenning to this during driving. I can recommend it for long
B0001611DI|4.0|The 70s were a different time.  The style of this film fits in well with other movies made back then.  The remake (made in 2004) was A LOT BETTER--A LOT--I gave it 5 stars.  That said, it's important to see this original in the proper light--limited budget and a 70s audience with lower expectations--much lower apparently.  The pacing and the editing of this film was hard to follow at times, with the characters moving on without much explanation. The oddest thing about this film was the inappropriate levity--the characters were actually having too much fun throughout which was just plain weird. I hated the biker scenes--too much road warrior and ZERO character development.  They added plot-line tension, but I hate the insinuation that, when faced with devastation, people are going to turn into barbarians.  Stupid--and it's a cheap right-wing lie so many of us buy into (consider the gun crazies of our society).  We have countless examples of people banding together and helping one another in times of crisis.  People might say &#34;oh, you're being too serious&#34;, but this movie would have been less campy and would have had more &#34;staying power&#34; in movie-making history if it had avoided those kinds of cliches, outright lies and &#34;hippie&#34; stereotypes.
B004GYY714|5.0|I use this app everyday .. From the island so I enjoy music from back home in Jamaica..love love it ..
B004MPESSY|4.0|It's always White Country Boys, who rape and kill Women.<br /><br />This is a good movie, but the same typical bad guys, we have all come to know &#34;The White Country Folks&#34;
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Like books that you can not put down?  That you will hold next to your plate when you eat dinner and will ignore all TV and read while your spouse lays next to your snoring?  Well this is the perfect book<br /><br />I loved this book.  I am a sucker for a suspenseful love story with a strong hero.  He is screwed up and she is screwed up but yet together they are wonderful.<br /><br />I didn't buy the second one because the reviews were mixed about reading it from his point of view.  However, its been a couple of weeks since I read it (I was going back through my kindle and looking at what books I have read and authors I like and found that I had not reviewed this one) and so I think I will now that its not fresh on my mind from just finishing it.  This book is a definite read again kind of book -that I think will be great to go back and read from his point.  I am glad it wasn't a cliffhanger.  Just because its not a cliffhanger does not mean its not a sit on the edge of your seat kind of book because it IS.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Good job of casting. Although not perfect, excellent conveyance of the look and feel of the book. Thanks to very good CGI, writing, directing, acting and production values, another fantasy masterpiece is brought to life. Can't wait for season 3.
B00BU8RNCE|4.0|I can't imagine having to live through what Mother Nature's wrath can wreak. Job well done of keeping it real.
B005OT2YVA|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. The 2nd one I didn't like but this one I did. First one is still the best.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Imagining what it will be like to learn about other species - someday it will happen - I hope we're ready!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really enjoyed this game.  The difficulty increased with the levels, which is good or it would be too easy. I like these types of games even though I am not good at them. I found some help online. I would like to play more levels.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I don't know how - but I had never heard of this story until I was back home in the U.S. and saw the trailer for the upcoming movie.  Friends with me all started raving about it so it was one of those &#34;Well, I guess I better see what this is all about!&#34; moments - SO glad I did, this man has quite the imagination - what WILL our children's future be like?
1489559396|4.0|The golden queen returns in this sequel novel. She has to go back in time to discover what happened to the lost souls and free them. I love the Native American cultural references and those remind my of my own sequel (RayzorWire - an Oklahoma based zombie novel) where the protagonist has to fight off evil forces to save her people, but with the golden queen she has two worlds to save, not just one!!!  What a fun young adult novel !
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Everyone was talking about this series - I work overseas and didn't get to see it until I got a VPN - now I'm addicted too!
B002U5HKZ6|2.0|Crime, Drug use, smuggling, black market, and slavery all accepted easy in the book and in some cases even rationalized. All of these activities take a terible toll on individuals and  come at a tremendous cost to society. Because of this I can not recommend it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I took this (Kindle version) book along on a two week road trip over the summer - my kids complained that I couldn't keep my nose out of it!
B003K1EYM6|1.0|I purchased this for iPad 4th generation and discovered this does not work for that model which is charged by the lighting fast charge (same charge as the iPhone 5) and this is not stated in the description. Very disappointing. I sent it back, because I couldn't even gift it to a friend who has an iPad 1, because it doesn't work for them either, they got the message (apple doesn't support this device) mind you this is &#34;supposing&#34; that this is a genuine apple product. It does have apple logo on the box.
B0036EDVS0|5.0|A great movie, the dark film sequences create a fantastic mode for this film and plays along wonderfully with Johnny Deps  recreation of Ichabod Crane. Johnny Deps out side the box acting really makes this character very believable which plays along wonderfully with the whole cast. A great movie that will leave you on the seat of your pants, nail biting  thought the entire film! And the added bonus of Christopher Walken cast has the Headless Horsemen , completes this fantastically made film.  A must see for the Halloween season!
B0089LOG02|5.0|This combines two different eras from the 20's to modern times and relates two different women both of whom have been through fostering.  I had a hard time putting it down once I started reading.  I just had to see what was going to happen next with Niamh.  I could just see some of the horrible foster homes she experienced.  This book is based on true facts too.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Saw this album on sale and thought I'd buy it. The songs on here are great and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes any Lady Gaga songs.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|The download was fast, the ap was free and it didn't cause any problems.  Now I can read PDF files.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|Thanks to the Creators of this game! I've never apologized so much to &quot;Granny&quot; for screwing up her mega runs! This is one of the BEST games I've had fun with so far! For a 51-year-old, most games seem &quot;run-of-the-mill&quot;. I haven't finished her &quot;runs&quot; yet, but I'm getting there! Thanks to the other detailed, reviewers--you helped me to choose this one today! Have a good one! :-D
B00BMKDTNC|2.0|I had read all 13 of the other WOT books, but when I finally got this one, I got about 2 chapters into it and realized that I just didn't care enough anymore to slog through the weighty prose. For about the last 5 books, it's seemed like there's been a lot of pointless activity in this seemingly interminable series, with little substantive plot progression or character development. As soon as I started this book, I realized how little I care about the characters, most of whom seem to have no distinctive characteristics. It probably didn't help my motivation that I had just re-read &#34;A Song of Ice and Fire,&#34; for the fourth time, and it is just so much better. So I closed the book and read the Wikipedia plot summary, which was a much better investment of my time as far as I can tell from reading other reviews of this book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Come get this app !! It's so fun . And addicting. A must play app. It's for all ages . Easy to follow through.
B004EPZ00C|5.0|Came on time and with the laughs. This is one of the family's favorite movies of all time, and we have really enjoyed seeing it again and again!
B00ELD3MUW|1.0|It keep stopping or it says it's not installed but the app is showing on my app  screen how do I delete it
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Love Breaking Bad and watched it for hours at a time. Best TV show ever in my opinion.(If you like grisly violence in shows) Interesting to see how White changes from a decent man to a ruthless meth cook.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Allies me to catch tweets and Facebook posts, plus dig as deeply as I like Ono stories from politics to news to technology and business to sports. Multiple top notch publications are at your fingertips.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|the story lumbered along from beginning to end...no highs, no real suspense, just a LOT of wordy filler...brief explanation at the end and you're done...it can't be about money at this point, Mr grisham, needs to recall the storyteller he once was...
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Love this movie! Directed in Baz Luhrman's signature style, beautifully shot, so many great scenes, talented cast, gorgeous costumes and fabulous soundtrack.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Fun little game. Could be more of a challange. Good graphics and sound. Wish the fill and destroy buttons weren't so close together. Would recommend to a friend.
B005EHILV4|5.0|love the mixer  i wish it had the recording software.  but  seller gets 10 ********* from me  great item yes doublerambow all the way
B00E8JZILA|5.0|I never played any of the other versions of this game, so the story is refreshing to me. Real time event and old graphic adventure point and click controls for this game. I prefer using the analog stick and buttons verses the touch screen. Great graphics and story make this a must own.
B00F2362IE|5.0|This game is soooooo awesome! There are upgrades that will totally rock your world. At first you can pick any turtle  but once you pick who you are you have to get 2540 coins to get another turtle. There is also dogpound and he is 1800 coins. April is 23000 coins. There is also turtle time. It is where you have to tap on targets before it's to late. So in conclusion I totally give this app a five pizza rating hope you enjoy it to!
B002RI9ZPY|4.0|I did like the book. A really good and consistent thriller. I would recommend the book to any thriller fun reader.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|If you're looking for an AMAZING, FREE, EASY-TO-USE, AWESOME Photoshop app, YOU'VE FOUND IT! There are sooooooo many things to  do on here!<br /><br />You can change pics so they look like they're on a fence, brick wall, notebook paper, and you can change the effect by adding lights, pictures, stamps, etc. You pretty much have Microsoft Paint, BUT BETTER!! You can do so much more than any other app.<br /><br />Personally, my favorite feature is the collage maker. You can make lots of different creations using different frames, styles, borders, etc. I'm so glad I got it, and you should too!!
B0053O89WY|5.0|Can't get enough of BBT.  Probably will keep collecting the series.  The extra behind the scenes is worth buying the collection.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|seemingly honest portrayal of life in prison written by an unlikely inmate. Much, much better than the sensationalized TV series.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Being lovers of opera we really enjoyed this movie.  Also Maggie Smith is a favorite of ours.  This is so enjoyable.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great plot, superb acting.  I just can't say enough to express how much I love this series.  Can't wait for the next season.
