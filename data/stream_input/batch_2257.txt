0307596885|2.0|I have been curious for a long time about Alice Munro so I picked up her book. I really looked forward to discovering her and loving her, after all the rave critical reviews. I found the stories boring, about boring people, boring thoughts and boring lives, told in slow, self important prose that jumped all over the place. There are nice little parts burried here and there. Overall, I didn't care about what I was reading, returned the book unfinished. Munro didn't engage me emotionally and intellectually. Cannot recommend it, sorry, unless you need something to read in small doses at night to put you quickly to sleep.
B009MO5960|5.0|Being that I grew up to the videogames and watched every movie over and aver again...I will always be a dedicated fan because of all the hard work and love that were put into the video games and movies for the audiences entertainment. Today there is no originality so the classics will never die and the movies had added in a new character Alice which the actress Milla Jovovich has always done a magnificent job! (: Thank you Paul for your wonderful movies!!
1476735115|5.0|Several hundred years after an apocalypse. Several silo's were built to house very many people. Each silo is isolated without knowing about one another. The novel flows smoothly, strong characters, and wonderful strong plot, which you will love. Yes, I could easily imagine that this is exactly the way it would be under these circumstances. I was disappointed in the ending, as it left me hanging...sort of, well it did have a good ending, but I thought the author could have easily made the book much longer. In fact, he needed to. There were a lot of things he could have added to make it longer. Instead of 509 pages, it could have been 700 pages that he could have had a better closure. I do think there will be a second book, maybe a trilogy. As I read  toward final chapter I kept asking myself, &#34;How could all this wrap up in the final chapter?&#34; It didn't completely. At the end of the book the author answers several questions. One ask, &#34;Is this really the end?&#34; He said, &#34;There's always another story to tell. Just maybe not the one readers expect&#34;. There you go, that question was no surprise for me, but the author's answer SHOULD have been, &#34;Read book #2&#34;. So, this question was exactly what I had been asking myself and still did not get the correct answer. This book took three years to write- how long till a second if there is one? It was still a great book overall. Since writing this review, I've learned there are 5 books in this series, but no where in the first book does it state that which was a huge mistake on the author's part.. Good !!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I thought this movie was excellent.  Great story and acting. Very good for family to enjoy together. May need to tie teens down for first 30 mins till action starts.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|Apparently based on a real person. New appreciation of the many forms love can take.<br />As a Catholic, I found the roles of the priest amd the therapist especially heartening - after all, Jesus came that we might have life & have it to the fullest. Lovely.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Best jewel matching game I've played on Android so far. Plenty of sound and visual effects and doesn't bombard you with ads. Another big plus is that you don't have to wait for one set of swaps to finish before starting another set. I would pay for this game.<br /><br />A couple of small minuses: The music got old very quickly, though it's easy enough to switch off. Also, more volume control than just on and off would be nice. (This is on a Galaxy Nexus, no idea if it's different on other devices)
B000W7JWUA|4.0|We play with our grand children, ages 6 and 9 often.  The do win without us giving them breaks.  This is just not a child's game, but it is not hard to play.  The pieces, being cardboard will warp and fray with use which is disappointing for such and expensive game.
B005K01VZS|5.0|Easy reading - profound messages about faith and kindness, forgiveness, and the joy and peace that comes from loving God and others, then learning to love ourselves.  Reading material for everyone.
B007V65R54|5.0|Although fairly episodic (the overarching theme is a little vague), it's a continually engaging and fun read that will give everyone, from prediction novices to statistical experts something new to think about. I got a number of concrete examples that I'll start using in discussion, and I enjoyed every page of the book.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|All of us need a reminder about time and taking pleasure in the moment (not worrying about yesterday or tomorrow):  turn everything over to the one in control - God.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|This movie sucked, I never review things, but I hated this movie so much I had to take time to tell everyone else.
B005H0IW6W|4.0|Was a gift for someone.  They seemed to like it just fine.  Quality was same as a retail store.  OK
B005USZYDU|4.0|There's good detail about the procedure of justice system.  I liked the idea of a kid being the centre of the story.  However, everything was too perfect at times.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Couldn't put the books down! I can't wait to see the movie now and the sequel in November! Should be great.
B0012GTZC0|3.0|Not one of his better books.  The ending was okay but the book was slow going for the most part.
B009O07NDY|5.0|The music is phenomenal. The disc and case art and designs are all beautiful as well. I will always treasure this purchase! Entirely worth getting a physical copy rather than just the iTunes tracks. I love looking through the pages and appreciating the nuanced art details that have gone into making The Hobbit truly special.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I:m a big fan season 3 is great but i think it could use a lot more zombie action. I think that season 1 and 2 were much better than this season
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This game is the perfect way to burn 20-30 minutes. Outstanding sound, especially if you use headphones. Love the artwork.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is a great movie for fans of 007 or even those that may be casual followers of the Bond series but are looking for a high energy entertaining movie. As far as the advertised \\"Digital Copy\\" it is exactly as advertised and it allowed me to download an iTunes copy without problems unlike that UltraViolet crap that blurays have sadly been mated with as of late.
B0022W6L6G|5.0|Fleetwood Mac, Greatest Hits-That's all you need to know.<br /><br />Short but sweet: The best of the best of Fleetwood Mac.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|I took a chance on this album after mixed reviews here on Amazon and I was not disappointed. I like the mixture of type of songs however if you are not a fan of the screaming style that A7F uses on other albums you probably will not like this album.
B004R6JG7G|5.0|Always one of my favorite movies.....I am a former Marine and was at NAS Miramar on several occasions when we would send Marine aircrews through Top Gun training..........great action scenes(there are a few minor flubs) and great music score.........Kelly McGillis and Meg Ryan are hot in this film.........just a great fun film to watch and now in Blu-ray.........can't be beat.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|fun on your own or with colleagues at lunch. highly recommend.  good practice for all ages. works well as a Tv alternate. fun on the go.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|Wonderful and daring just like Joplin and Dylan!! I truly appreciated the creative music sounds that complement each song.  Why this wonderful musician not found years ago is still unbelievable!!  This video is a must see!!  Bottom line...love all his songs and his simple, humble way of life!!
B0085RQLXK|5.0|Ok,  granted, we don't need anymore Aerosmith Power Ballads. Example here is What Could've Been Love. Another Last Goodbye however, is just classic Aerosmith, love song/story song with great vocals. The rock songs on Music From Another Dimension are pretty darn good. Oh Yeah, is the song we Aerosmith fans have been waiting for Good songs like  Lover A Lot is awesome.  I am happy to hear them really rocking an original again. Something fairs better than the opener LuvXXX. Street Jesus is a cool song. Legendary Child is almost back to form. I say almost because we're not up to Pump standards yet, but getting closer than Get A Grip ever did, except for the ballads that is.  All in all, pretty good album by Aerosmith. Keep on rocking. Something is probably my favorite, actually Joe Perry sings on Something, and although it bears the same title of the Beatles song, the resemblence ends there. Give this one a chance, it's pretty good. Thanks.
B000002KLP|5.0|SO their I was sitting in my college radio station, and I pulled this (CD now) old record out of the back by the door row, and said to the DJ that was  , bout half my age (I am 60) \\"hey what would you do if your sister came home with him\\". He laughed, and I said \\"have you ever heard of Prince\\", he said that his older brother was into him at the tail end of his career, but I have never seen that album. I said, how about a bet; if you can play the whole CD right through without interruption. So he put in on because I told him, it was not just good, in my opinion it is in the top 100 albums of all time, if you play it right through on this Friday night on campus. So he did, and the phones exploded to find out all sorts of information. I gave him all the information I could. It could not be played on the radio. It was clearly the best party album of my youth, but you had to play it loud. He broke in and told everyone to turn up their stereos. That was it. In a matter of minutes, I went from old man, to rock god. I thanked him and went home, and dug out my vinyl. I put it on loud and I was satiated for about an hour. It bought back a lot of sex dreams, but I noticed, as did he, that if you put this CD out today, people would still say \\"this is Prince, it is so raw\\".......yup raw and classic.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a great book, and a MUST READ.Gillian Flynn is an awesome writer. She has a writing style that keeps you guessing to the very end.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Really deserves 5 stars. Reading about cancer is sad but this book turns it into a celebration of life and how we choose to live. I wish I knew Hazel and Augustus, but they're far too interesting for me. Loved this book in all its sadness and life and love.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I'm so happy they came out with number 2! I really like the new obstacles like riding the rope and the caves! I'm glad there is a game that never ends and always keeps challenging me! AMAZING APP
B00867GKIK|5.0|Disney Pixar 3-D is the best!<br />I have a Sony LED 3-D TV and the 3-D is awesome!<br />Having the digital copy is a good bonus!
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|Fun book for boys!! Well make that for the parents to. My boys love the crazy shenanigans that happen along the way.
B003TTH4IU|5.0|I love going back to see these characters in the first days of the series. They changed and grew through the series and thats fun to see because thats real life.
B009A9BF5G|1.0|I had to double check my vision at first. Then I had to ensure the television and Blu-Ray player were functioning properly so I inserted another disc. Yes, everything was as it should be on the hardware end. I even checked it on a separate Blu-Ray Player and television to make sure and the result was the same. The picture quality is extremely grainy and absolutely unacceptable. It looks like it was captured on a handheld camera ant not even close to professional standards. I purchased this concert DVD as a nice piece to play in the background but cannot justify the price when it looks this bad.<br />Do not buy if you expect Blu-Ray quality video.
B004U52VPS|1.0|This game is crap. The concept is crap. The pieces are crap. Everything about Angry Birds and this game is garbage.
1451696191|5.0|This is a very good book! I recommend that anyone should read it but people who passed high school NEED to read it!
B009A9EQL6|5.0|It's Aerosmith, of course it is good!  It's new Aerosmith though, not old, so if you are a traditionalist you might have a problem with it, but if you like all things Aerosmith you will like it.  There are one or two songs that are iffy but that's true of all albums/CD's.  I liked this package because of the bonus tracks.  Haven't watched the DVD yet.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Depressing and pointless book.  There really wasn't much of a story, just a lot disfunctional characters.  Not one of the characters was very likeable.  Regret buying and reading it.  if it wasn't for the book club I would not have finished it.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Great addition to any movie collector or batman fan. Just wish it had a logical ending. But the producers prolly had some sway in this folly.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Paranormal that is different. It is Very kid friendly.  Wide open for a next book.  Enjoyed it. Would recommend it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Would get 5 stars if there was more of a story in this book. I felt it was too short and choppy. It's definitely a stepping stone to the real meat of the story that is wrapped up in the third book in the trilogy.
B00171WXY2|5.0|FORMATION OF DAMNATION is another great HEAVY THRASH album from the great TESTAMENT!!!!! All the songs are good, some are among TESTAMENT´s best like THE HENCHMAN RIDE, AFTERLIFE, THE PERSECUTED WON´t FORGET and the title track!!!!! TESTAMENT is truly a gifted METAL band with some nice lyrics and a great singer!!!!! i totally recommend this MODERN THRASH MASTERPIECE.....try DARK ROOTS OF THE EARTH and THE GATHERING too....TESTAMENT RULES!!!!!!!!!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|This alarm is a great addition to the Kindle Fire app family. I really enjoy the wordy clock on this. I position my kindle on my bookcase with the wordy version of the clock and it becomes a talking point.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|What a great album!!!!! i am really surprised on how good WORSHIP MUSIC IS!!!!!! The band sound still rocks hard, the songs are inspired and BELLADONA vocals are better than ever!!!!! Some songs are among the best stuff they created like THE DEVIL YOU KNOW, HELL ON EARTH, THE GIANT and I´M ALIVE!!!!!!WELL DONE, ANTHRAX!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0012FHGCW|5.0|Really like the story and acting. I liked that fact that is was based on a true story as well.
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|Dark Roots of Earth is one of the best albums from the great Thrash band Testament!!!! Its almost the same classic line up from the 80s with a powerful modern feeling, Chuck Billy shining with great vocals and a talented Thrash Metal band!!!! This one is really great, some of their best with the masterpieces LOW, Gathering and Practice What you Preach!!!!!Highly recommended if you like the old Testament!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome you should get it there is a creativity mode and a survival mode. On creativity mode you can fly and make anything and on survival mode you can kill monsters and mine so you can make the neather and go to the neather. So remember to get mindcraft it is awesome.
B000002L61|5.0|DIO create a LOT of great Rock and Heavy Metal in his brilliant career.....while their debut solo is a complete masterpiece, THE LAST IN LINE maybe is his best solo album!!!! HOLY DIVER and LOCK UP THE WOLVES come real close but this one is amazing...well, most all DIO stuff is amazing....DIO RULES!!!!!!
B0083Z3O8Y|4.0|While the books by Jane Austen, follow a similar pattern, they do not disappoint. The climax for the heroin comes much later than previous stories. Fortunately, the first part of the book is much more entertaining than some of her other novels.  It will keep you in suspense wondering when Emma will finally come to her senses.
B000002HMH|5.0|METALLICA is a METAL icon, and their 5 previous albums are among the best METAL EVER!!!!! LOAD shows a total transition on the fast THRASH of METALLICA into something with more groove and slower....when LOAD come in 96 i really liked some songs, but i thought that this isn´t METALLICA anymore, and yes yes, they really sold their sound a bit(Mamma said)....it´s like another band, with HUGE influences from Alice in Chains and Soundgarden....now, i´m way older and can appreciate music for what it is...and LOAD is a GREAT GREAT METAL album!!!!no, is not THRASH anymore.....but a cool METAL album with gens like KING NOTHING, UNTIL IT SLEEPS, AIN´T MY BITCH, THE HOUSE JACK BUILT and 2 X 4!!!!! in fact, all the songs are nice......METALLICA is a great great METAL icon, and LOAD is another solid collection of songs!!!!!WELL DONE, METALLICA!!!!!
B000FA5STS|5.0|This book was awesome.  So many twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat.  I would highly recommend this book.
B000002H33|5.0|MASTER OF PUPPETS is one of the greatest METAL albums EVER, and with REIGN IN BLOOD are the 2 best THRASH METAL albums OF ALL TIME!!!!RUST IN PEACE and BENEATH THE REMAINS are close, but RIB and this masterpiece MASTER OF PUPPETS rule over it!!!!!After 2 AMAZING THRASH albums(KILL EN ALL, RIDE THE LIGHTNING), METALLICA create this HEAvy RELENTLESS BEAST!!!!aLLO THE SONGS ARE AMAZING!!!!! this is one of the best albums ever!!!!!!!!!!!!well done, Metallica!!!!!!

B009EEFTMC|4.0|This one is a challenge.  You are racing against your own best time and it can be addictive. If you like puzzles, give this one a try
B000063DI8|4.0|i remember when this good album NO PRAYER FOR THE DYING was created in 90 and really think the MAIDEN sound changed A LOT!!!!! of course, Adrian Smith left the band, and his guitar tones and compositions are part of the greatest period for Maiden.....on NO PRAYER, Maiden change their METAL for a more HARD ROCK sound....well, it´s really not one of the best MAIDEN albums, but got great songs like TAILGUNNER, HOLY SMOKE, BRING YOUR DAUGHTER and PUBLIC ENEMA!!!!!if you already love MAIDEN´s sound you may like this nice HEAVY ROCK album!!!!!UP THE IRONS NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!

B0007TKNKG|4.0|My bargain-rack movie for last night was the \\"Over The Top\\" DVD starring Sylvester Stallone. I found it for under five bucks. Well, I've come to regard Stallone movies as little monuments to bad acting, and that was the case here. However, altogether this was a rather  entertaining movie and I enjoyed it. The movie was simple, straight forward, emotional and would probably appeal to any father with a little boy, such as me. Stallone played a tough but sensitive big-truck (18 wheeler) driver who was out to save his little boy from an unwanted adoption when his ex-wife was expiring. The grandfather, who had low regard for our hero, was trying to take over the boy and exclude Stallone. It turned into a complicated legal battle, of  course, and Stallone had little understanding or sympathy for the law. The movie had Stallone driving  from Colorado to Las Vegas where he was to participate in  the World Arm-Wrestling Championships. The boy accompanied Stallone part way (a rather touching part of the movie) until he was captured. He finally managed to escape and attend the Championship Event and watch his father emerge victorious.<br /><br />Well, Las Vegas was Las Vegas and it was so grotesque it was actually funny. The World Arm Wrestling Championships somehow fit Las Vegas, and it gathered Neanderthalic males from all over the world. Stallone fit in with the assembled crowd. Whoever put this movie together had a perverse sense of humor, and my hat is off to him/her. Good job! Stallone won, of course, but in a drawn out and dramatic fashion. He won the boy over and everyone, presumably, lived happily ever after. What can I say? It was an enjoyable movie. Lots of fun! The photography was  good. The background music got tiresome with all those oldie songs dominating, but I guess it fit. The acting was what you might expect in a Stallone movie, but the story moved  along rather  well.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

B0015XAT3Y|5.0|This was my first E.L.O. album. When it came out on LP it had a paper cut out of the spaceship of the cover within. I purchased this back in the 80's. I still love their music today.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Loved the prospective of both Mark and his wife.  I am so glad there are people in this country that love doing this and they have my deepest respect.  I feel so much safer knowing these people do such a great job.  Read this book, it is very well done.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I enjoyed playing this game and the price was excellent! I give it five stars because it played well, with no hiccups!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Instead of the camerabag which came with the camera this one is soooo much better. Easy to handle, everything fits in it even my off camera flash and cable, and more lenses and lots of other stuff. Take it with me every time i go out and no one knows my expensive stuff is in it!
B009FZHYKU|3.0|I find that I am enjoying the show less in season three, due to the fact that almost all of the characters are becoming rather inhuman – and I’m not talking about the zombies.  Rick is clearly not himself, but his distrust of all strangers – to the point of ignoring pleas for help and letting them die – I find irrational and unappealing.  The group should be attempting to find allies - there is certainly strength in numbers – and I hope that the writers let Rick regain his senses and his moral compass.  I would refuse to follow a leader who drives past a man alone by himself on the side of the road – leaving him to certain death as he yells for help.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I recommend this book to just about anyone. The craftsmanship o  thus book is absolutely amazing. It's just a great read.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Truly amazing this is free!  I use the app daily in my personal faith as well as in my ministry.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Acting is great.  Story line is interesting and shows the inside workings of old society.  I would recommend it highly.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|The graphics in this game set a delicious sense of mystery and foreboding.  Some HO games for the Kindles hide items in terrible locations that you simply cannot touch, but this game had none of those bugs.  Very enjoyable gameplay.

B007REV4YI|5.0|This movie, no doubt, had the best story line and character development of any Bond movie ever. There is nothing more that needs to be said. The movie speaks leagues for itself.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome it could beat trample run any day any time so if think otherwise kiss my ass
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was just so crazy! I couldn't stop reading if you thought the first book was intriguing the you just have to read this one. It has more action and it has a total different affect on me like things I didn't expect to happen! I couldn't put this book down I highly recommend it to all and if you haven't read the first book you definitely  should.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the best game ever. It is addicting and fun.  My favorite place is Rome, then Rio, and last but not least, in New York.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Worthwhile app. Pinterest is very interesting site. Receipes or projects and ideas....go to pinterest and there is just what you have been looking for.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is amazing and easy to play.  I like it because it changes places.  I think everyone should download sub way surfer.
B00932AA5G|5.0|This movie was a real surprise. My wife and I spent a half an hour discussing the movie after it was over. I really do not want to give anything away,  all I can say is, watch it. Truly a five star movie, the definition of a sleeper.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like most of the game it freezes sometimes please buy the game<br /><br />And I love the fun things it's very pleasing
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I watched this show when it was a weekly series, Now it's great to watch the episodes in rapid succession.
B009VIZDLI|2.0|Felt like hard work reading this book. The characters weren't very exciting. Didn't get very far into it before I gave up
B008EKON56|1.0|It would have been great if it had worked longer than a week.  I now get intermittent output in one channel depending on the positioning of the adapter - and it never stays in the correct position.  The device worked well prior to this, albeit only for a week.
B001I45UFC|5.0|I really like it. It had everything in the real book. Read this book. Except for the fact that it was seven dollars. Other then that I would give it five stars. The pictures were very cool.

0316227706|5.0|Seth Casteel is a photographic artist and this book is wonderful way to display his amazing underwater photos of dogs.
0060730552|2.0|I love adventure/survival books.  I have read far too many to mention -- everything from Mt. Everest to Andes to lost at sea -- and I have loved all of them.  This book had such high reviews I decided to add it to my list.<br /><br />Sadly, it is an utter bore.  It's not just that the book is far too advanced in its use of terms for the average reader (or even the reader with a beginner's level of mountaineering), it's just flat dull.  I felt like I never knew anything about the (true life) characters.  Joe?  Simon?  I felt no vested interest in either of them.  The only character I felt a connection to was Richard (who is barely in it) and that's because they at least talked about his life!  It felt like it took forever for anything to happen and I was just reading a diary account of every part of a regular climb.<br /><br />Ugh, so dull.  So boring.  Matter of fact, I can't even finish it.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I must have a later version than previous raters  This app does all of the issues mentioned.  I like the option of adding new sounds. I use this at night due to tinnitus ( ringing in the ears). It is quite effective and I sleep soundly.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is the best game in the world. It is my favorite game on my tablet. Best game ever on tablet.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I would highly recommend this series to anyone that enjoys drama !!!  Suspenseful and engaging.  Can't say enough.  And I have just watched through the 3rd episode !!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Read this book in one day, until the wee hours in morning...could not put it down!  This s a must read!
B008S4YZCO|2.0|it could of been so fun it could of goten 6 stars but it faild me. One word to say how. IN APP PURCHASES. if a gane discription say that you can use real mony to buy things do not buy. If gamloft whants to make money have the app for 1.99 or 2.99 or something  like that and have all the stuff in the game playable.
0399230033|5.0|My son absolutely adores this book.  There aren't a lot of words to it and the story is pretty basic, but he loves seeing all of the animals and laughing at the naughty gorilla.  This is the first book that I caught him &#34;reading&#34; to himself.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Really, I could not put it down.  I think the term heart-wrenching would be perfect for this book.  This is my first Colleen Hoover book but, will not be my last.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was a quick easy read that I couldn't put down.  I can't wait to see the movies they are making for this trilogy.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|i think you have to be 9 and under to like this game.. it's a little on the boring side
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Great game if you like match 3 games. Lots of levels and beautiful graphics. Worth the price! Hours of play!
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|Sigh, I feel in love with this beautiful story.  The characters were flawed but trying so hard to be the best people they could be.  It was a delight to read the snappy dialogue, in fact I slowed me reading down to enjoy every delicious word.  The very best part of the book was the very end.  It was the most beautiful moment and my eyes filled with tears.  Thank you for an memorable and emotional story that spoke to my heart.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|Excellent, fits perfect, keeps my Kindle Fire HD 7 protected and I like that it's made for the Kindle Fire only.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|Enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone wanting to watch a good movie.  I have all the movies in this set.
B008AUGEFC|2.0|At first, I thought that my review would be \\"I don't like this book at all\\", but then I thought that it wouldn't be fair for the people who actually read my reviews. The beginning of the book is a very bad one: it drags forever, the language is complicated, and the writing is messy. Apart from that, the story is not interesting at all. Why the author chose to put that story first is something that I cannot understand. Supposedly, you have to make the reader feel like they cannot put the book down. It took me forever to go past the first pages, but I forced myself to go on, since I hate stopping reading books at such an early stage. Once I managed to finish that first story, I felt like some of my neurons had committed suicide, so I decided to skim-read the following story. It was equally badly written and uninteresting, so I started hopping from one page to the other, trying to find a point in which the book would actually hook me up. It totally failed to do so. I will never try to read this book again. It just boggles my mind, and not in a good way.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|Enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone wanting to watch a good movie.  I have all the movies in this set.
B000W93CHC|4.0|Follett is a master at bringing you into the story through superb character development and carefully crafted storytelling. It feels like you are right there in 14th century England.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Good game nice graphics but can't get far without needing to spend money. Hard to accomplish missions w/I money. U need more words to make 20
B008JFUNAU|5.0|This movie was simply amazing. The movie was exactly as described an oz disney movie. Homages to Disney and the original wizard of oz can be found throughout the movie. I thought everyone was really great in their roles. Many people have said that didn't like Mila Kunis as the wicked witch of the west but I thought she was Awesome as a younger version of the iconic character. My favorite scenes were the wicked witch scenes though so I may be a bit biased. As a horror movie fan I really loved the creepy feel in a family movie. A lot of this is brought to you by the amazing feel Raimi brings to the movie putting his signature touches throughout so if your a Raimi fan like I am you will most likely love this. Overall I think if you have an open mind and don't go in to compare it to what will always be the best 1939 film I think you will enjoy it. The visuals and story amazed me so I hope it will for you to.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This had replaced my old alarm.<br />it had done a very nice job, I especially like the math setting to be able to thorn off the alarm.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my kid loves this app so much because she feels like she is actually taking care of her own pet horse
1616550414|5.0|It's got all the information and iconography represented that a history of the Zelda franchise should have.  The material the book is made of too is of top notch quality.  really happy to have it sitting on my shelf.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Have watched this movie many times now... Great acting, beautiful story.  Sad at times but realistic and not your typical sappy period romance.  Highly recommend.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome!<br />I think kids or adults should get it<br />Because... when you get it you will want to play more and more and more!<br />Love, Lily Lily
034580404X|5.0|I had been waiting for a long time to buy and read these books and I was so thrilled to find them being sold as a set for the price of just one of them. They arrived in new condition and I truly loved it!!
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|I think this game suks. you have to wait a LONG time.wend I bought this game I didn't even get to play it. my. name is Desiree just to let you know.please do not by this game I am warning you.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a nice game for when you are bored. very fun!! my kids and i enjoy playing before bedtime.
B00942X8PY|5.0|I finally got around to playing this, and now I'm hooked. Pretty much in this puzzle game, each square has a certain number of moves you can take, and your goal is to fill up the entire square. There are a few set of tutorial like puzzles in the first set of games in the puzzle mode so you can get the gist of the game. After getting halfway through the starter puzzles, I was able to get a very good hang of it, though I'm not anywhere near finished. Yes, you are timed in the puzzle mode, but with the harder ones, I don't even care since I take my time anyway. And the sarcastic remarks if you get awarded or not is pretty funny and makes getting bronze a bit better.<br /><br />Even though I got this when it was free, this app is one of the few I wouldn't mind actually paying for. I would recommend this to anyone who loves puzzle games.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|It has a great story line, but at times is really drawn out and maybe overly detailed? I intend to read the rest of the series though.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|I love scary games, even if I don't actually ever beat them. But, I've never played any of the other Slender Man games, so I don't have anything to compare this one to.<br /><br />So, based on that, at first, I was confused as what to do. I mean, there was no intro or info, even on the controls. So, it took me a second to realize how to walk and not just to look around. The pieces of paper you collect give you instructions on how to stay alive but you have to get to them first, and I'm not sure if they give you these rules in the other games. I had to find out the hard way that you weren't supposed to look at him and then I got to the paper that said not to look. (Side note: I thought it was kinda funny at first, with no effects on, Slender Man is just standing in the far back beyond the fallen tree.) I think the goal is to pick up papers along the way. I got 7/8 on my third try before posting this review, but I'm pretty sure the 3rd piece cheated on me and it wasn't where it was supposed to be, so I gave up for now. The game definitely gets harder as you progress, especially when Slender Man...grows limbs or tentacles?<br /><br />I liked this game, but my big problem was the controls for my kindle fire. They were a bit glitchy and it made fast turns and running away or turning around fast really hard. At the end with the house, because of the controls and Slender Man's appearance, it made for hard coordinating through it.<br /><br />I usually like playing scary games with the sound loud, but the cricket \\"white noise\\" sound got too annoying on high, and I had to keep the volume around half. But, the graphics, though at first I wished they were a bit better, I liked since I think it would've made the game much more scarier with perfect graphics.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I would never have found this book without my kindle fire. Loved it by the way time to read the sequel
B008I3RARW|2.0|First, I wanted to say that I'm a horrible video game racer. Anything racing, I pretty much have the tact of a five year old. This game made me feel like I could race, which means that this is simple, non challenging, and way too easy.<br /><br />In the game, there is only one track where you can \\"race\\" two CPU's l, time race, and pretty much another version of the time race. I tried all three settings of driving. The motion was by far easier to achieve a constant high speed and slower decrease in speed. The steering wheel was a bit touchy on my kindle fire and constantly made me miss corners. I didn't much care for the paddles. The stick on both steering and speed were definitely the best and easiest to use and maneuver the car.<br /><br />At first, because the CPU's always get a speed boost, it seems as if they would be a challenge, but after you get to the first corner it's like they lose the ability to drive. You can actually get pretty far ahead when they get to the double turns before they can navigate their way through. Even bumping into all the walls and getting turned around a couple times, it's still easy to beat them.<br /><br />It seems as if this game had potential but the programmers didn't want to go into depth with it to actually make it a challenge. The game itself isn't so bad, just boring. It would've been a lot better with more tracks, harder computers, and maybe even multiplayer. The only thing I truly loved was the sky art. I'm glad I got this free and was able to test it without wasting my money.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love this game.  It is soothing to play it and I never get tired of it.  I take my Fire to the airport and other places where I can play the game while waiting.  it never gets old.  If I make it to one hundred, I will still be playing this game.  Lot's of others have come on the market, but I still love this one.  It is a basic game and will be around a long time.  Thanks Jewels Star..
B00992CF6W|5.0|You can see gr8 sights and if you want to you can get an app that lets you edit your game
1603420398|5.0|The patterns and colors are breath taking.  I still like books that have covers and that you can share.  I love my Fire, but there is something special about real books.  Will never tire of them.  Look forward to finding the great color combo's and making some lovely items.  Thanks
B006LSZECO|5.0|clever story. no hollywood ending, which in my opinion, is very refreshing. great read. well written, good plot development and complex characters.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is a heart wrenching tale of a family falling apart.  The story is paced like a ticking time bomb!  I only wish that jacob had been developed a little more.
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|I LOVE GREY ANATONY I CAN WACTH EVERY DAY IT WAS CHEAP I LOVE IT MY FARTOIVE SHOW HAPPY HAPY
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I have followed Josh's career from the start and have all of his CDs.  This is his best, most creative and vocal work to date.  Such a wide variety of music and style, which show the talent and eclectic abilities of this man.  From Irish traditional, to county and pop flavor, and to the usual Italian aria, he shines.  A must for all Groban fans and a treat and awesome introduction to new purchasers.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|My daughter is four years old and loves to watch cartoon movies. I'm 35, and I too love to watch cartoon movies! Haha...It's like a little bonus when I can watch those movies and bond with my daughter. This is a really fun and entertaining movie. The characters are amazing in HD!
B005OCHOZS|5.0|I completely enjoyed Scott's book, and found great motivation from the story. It was fun to read and one of those books you didn't want to end.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|I have such a hard with books keeping my interest long enough to finish them, but this one had no trouble keeping me interested all the way through. The setting, the plot, and the way I was able to visualize what was happening as I was reading it was amazing. This is a phenomenal read, and I would and will be recommending this to everyone. I can't wait to read more from this author. Just Amazing!
0061906220|5.0|a fun character! laid back attitude and just all around cool!  kids love it! adults love it!the song sticks in your head for days!
B000H30B2C|4.0|GOOD STUFF, I love this remake of the original.  It's cool.  I like that Ann is actually friends with Kong and not just screaming her head off the entire movie.  It worked in the original but this was kewlz
B007FEFLTO|5.0|So much to say! Without spoiling it for others I say just read it already.  You will be fully entrenched in the characters lives immediately.
B000AY3KN0|5.0|Awesome Movie, one of my favorite old movies.  It's crazy good and awesome.  Everyone should watch it it's col and stuff
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Incredible read.  No other series has managed to capture World War I in such contrasting lights.  A true story of the people not the politics.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Follow on story from the first book. Wonderful story that had me captivated. I can not wait for the next book to be released!
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Fantastic  best ever  I have played it 20 times already .Downloaded to 2 computers and its the best cd for the price go Amazon!!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Character are deep. Story is solid. Ending is perfect. I highly recommend the book. However, I will say that it is not for kids...rape and sexual abuse rampant throughout.
B001EC0OMW|4.0|This was made in a time when horror was barely hitting the mainstream. This movie of course may not have as much gore as<br />a horror fan would want, considering this was made at least ten years before extreme gore and violence became a staple in horror films. The unsettling atmosphere, and the occasional blood in the more dramatic scenes, however greatly compensate for<br />the lack of extreme violence and gore horror fans would expect from this production, considering that this was released in 1958. This film has certainly been done very well for its time period, and I highly recommend<br />this to any horror fan that wants to one of the first horror films made in Technicolor.
B004HW7JHE|5.0|Love this series, ate it up like dessert!  I can't wait for the new season to start. ****** *** **
0307744434|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel. It came highly recommended and did not disappoint. Those who don't like fantasy may not enjoy it but I personally hope to see a sequel. Really unique story.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|The second half of the season has seen a real resurgence of the show. The writing proves there is some juice left in the story!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book was great and I read it in just a few days. I found it hard to follow for the first few chapters but then I was hooked. Both the past and the present stories were intriguing. I really liked the way the author tied in OCD/PTSD to the storyline. I have recommended it to all my friends.
B0070R40V6|4.0|Martins book is indeed a work of art. He introduces so many characters within the life of this one book it keeps you enthralled. I did however find it hard to keep track of who's who in the zoo and was grateful when the TV verson came out after I had read the book, so that when I picked up book 2 I recognised all the characters once again.
B007REV4YI|5.0|An interesting story and easy for me to keep my interest going. I would recommend it. Daniel Craig rates right up there behind Sean.
B0056CUZRA|5.0|Follets latest , is like his other books for me, so hard to put down, and hey, never want to get to the end because they are such a great read.<br />The way that this book followed his previous novel World without end was amazing.<br />The characters, the setting, the dialogue as he writes keeps me spell bound.<br /><br />Key to Rebecca was my first forey into this author, I think, I have since read everything he's written... so I could be biased.A great story teller
B005RUUUAI|5.0|the walking dead is the best show on television right now, my grandson and i watch it ; along with a few other family members. i love all the characters, i miss shane, t-dog, and dale. i can't wait to see what happens to the gov. i just know rick is not going to let him get away with what he has done and trying to do. i feel that laurie is going to die and tyrese and shasa is coming back to the group and rick is going to accept them. this show is so good , but you have to watch it from the beginning to understand why so many people are drawn to it. only two more episodes i hope we don't have to wait until next season to see the gov. go down. i hope they leave the sex scenes out, this is one reason i love the movie too, not a lot profanity and sex; keep it clean all you directors. i love the way rick stare at people, i'm over 60 and he is toooo good looking. i've seem season 1&2 , but this review is about season three and i've watch all the seasons up to now about a 100 times.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|this game takes forever to load,  freezzes up allthe time,  and is imposisble to get things because it is jittery.  : (
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I read the reviews before I got this game. I thought it wouldn't be scary. Man was I in for a surprise. The first time I chose the road and in daylight. It still felt like night. Anyway one time I went into an old looking building I was scared because I had six pages and I got the seventh page I was excited and when I stepped out of the building and there he was. I screamed and ran for the telephone booth. I then turned it off. Probably one of the best slender games out there. GET THIS GAME.<br />P.S. On easy mode when you get five pages slender then starts popping up with his tentacles.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|pretty good. wish more energy would be available faster. also wish there was a larger variety of horse breeds and color.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|If you are willing to go full series, Blu-Ray I'm going to assume you already know theses movies. I loved the books as a young adult, I loved the movies as an early adult... but the Blu-Ray collection as a full bird adult? I fell back in love. Revisiting old friends while my husband enjoyed alongside, has to be some of the most fun I've had in my own home viewing experience. Don't hesitate, I found this collection on Amazon while standing at Best Buy. It was $30.00 cheaper on Amazon at the time and I'm so glad I shopped around first.
B00A0MJ9ZA|4.0|Keeps the grandchildren mesmerized for the entire movie. The storybook app is great for bedtime as the grandchildren are eager to got to bed
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|i love angry birds but this did not come with the bad piggies game.  Not the Bad Piggies app, but the bad piggies on the Angry Birds.  Those of you who like angry birds will know what I'm talking about.
B00AFEY354|5.0|am a Big fan of Emma watson that is why i got the movie but when i watched it it was a great movie
B006YGMHTQ|5.0|I really enjoy this war theme comedy staring Robin Williams.Robin is so funny. But the story also make a social, moral statement.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|Some things are cool but I think you should make some of your books longer because people want more .
B007BFSYMS|4.0|When my mind iracing a million miles an hour and I can't seem to relax and close my eyes for sleep this app has ben a great help.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Fun game. It's just too short once you pay the 2.99 to finish it, only took me a few hours to complete it.
B003E6FW5A|5.0|When I first saw the movie when it came out years ago I was touched by the beautiful music. I am so glad to have this in my collection.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|I love this book, and the fact that its available on kindle is awesome. I just wish the rest of the books were.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the best season yet. I've been on the edge of my seat since season 1. I highly recommend season 3.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|Heart wrenching, well written, a necessary read for most middle and high school students, but completely inappropriate and heart-breaking for ESE students. What's the message? That it's better to be \\"stupid\\" so you don't know people are bullying and laughing at you? For the small population of people sharing that low IQ, life is painful and lonely. Friends from their youth dump them when they are identified and separated as different in grammar school. Then in middle and high school, they are taunted, bullied and their peer group becomes other kids like themselves plus all the behavior problem kids. As parents we are scolded by teachers to make sure our impressionable children hang out with the \\"right\\" people, but they force them to spend the entire day with the very people they are warning us about. Great book, got me going, made me cry because my child and I have to live his life every day. Thankfully, unlike Charly, our child has advocates to protect against the \\"ESE system.\\" I invite comments that point out why this book would be an \\"uplifting\\" and \\"positive\\" read for ESE students, because it totally escaped me.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Love this game. Have only been playing it for a couple of day but think  I will become an addict.
B003U4UNPK|5.0|I can't get enough of lost, it just keeps you guessing and wondering what's going to happen next after every episode! If you have neve seen this, then you are missing out on something great! You find out new things every episode!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I really liked it.  A touching story of true love.  It is a book that I could not put down.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I really like this game it has been a fun interesting game to play and hope anyone who wants a relaxing game to play should give it a try
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun,easy,addictive game for all ages....good idea if your considering a new first pet .  you can even work your way up to owning a unicorn.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|The author kept the book's story going up and down. Different times in the story, it was exciting and other times it was telling you more about the characters. This book was great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is entertaining for most kids it can crop you busy for hours at a time.<br />I recommend this game for anyone looking for something fun.
1451695195|4.0|Dr. Alexander who is a well known neurosurgeon has written a very personal and touching novel about his own Near Death Experience.  He describes his experience in a positive, colorful, hopeful, and wonderous story about his experience while in a deep coma.  The touching details about his family are truly heartening and his scientific background has been shaken about the fact that maybe after this life, there is another place where the Heavenly Being as God himself welcomes even skeptics to His Kingdom.  A refreshing look at the Afterlife with an intriguing medical foundation.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The characters in this book became so real I didn't want to leave them, but the story was so compelling I couldn't stop reading. A definite page turner, charming and so lovingly told.
030758836X|4.0|Gripping and scary and a realistic tale of a young married couple; keeps you riveted until the end; Great picture-painting skills by the author constantly second-guessing who is the Antagonist and who is the Protagonist; very entertaining book by a talented author
B00AJLHUAS|3.0|ok cd its diffintily old time music but I love jazz so I'm happy would recommend to someone looking for old time music
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Riley is Ralph and Ralph is Riley. I can't think of a more perfect actor to lead this film than John C. Riley. He brings a much more evolved character to this movie, making the animated Ralph seem more human than many...humans. And Sarah Silverman is just as good. It has all the high-quality elements you'd expect in a Disney cartoon and a little bit more.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|What's not to like about a game that will entertain grand children for hours...and it's free. You can't beat the deal.
1597801585|5.0|Many authors are getting in to the bio-apocalypse these days but the Windup Girl is a standout. Making the protagonist a sex slave was a stroke of genius. Unlike most dystopia novels, where the main characters are just vehicles to explore the dystopia, the author really makes the windup girl memorable, even lovable.
B002U3CCF6|4.0|Gillian Flynn has the ability to weave stories around the most damaged of characters.She keeps you reading even as your gut is churning.
B0000714BP|5.0|buy it or die! buy it or die! buy it or die! buy it or die! sursly! hahaha for real! John, Patrick, and Wesley... word!
B0090P98Z4|4.0|so far so good. great graphics and not so glu. bound that its not fun. rem of the old gountlet
B009A9ETFE|5.0|&#34;Still I wonder, wonder why!&#34; Dickfishes, It's awesome. Everyone should own it like slippery moose turds... four more words, yo.
B00785P2QC|2.0|Heh it's OK don't think it's really as challenging as it should be though. It's really easy that's all<br />If that make it a bit harder it would be better
1878424319|5.0|Change is hard for most people.  Somehow the guidance in this book made change easy.  It's been 2 months since I first read The Four Agreements, and my life is just plain better now.  I have let go of lifelong practices which caused me pain.  I am able to be more honest in my speech and thoughts. My children are happier with me.  Decisions come more easily.  This book has been a lifechanger for me.
034580404X|5.0|NOT a spoiler*****<br />Romances aren't usually my favorite but this trilogy was awesome. The first book was a little graphic but if that's not your thing don't worry the second book was great. Freed was a slower read but overall this was page turner!!! I highly recommend to anyone!
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Great movie for any young girl, wonderful colors and picture. The story is wonderful, about a girl who is different becoming wonderful!
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Love Frankl's narrative of Auschwitz. A sad story but makes you think about life differently, an easy read for anyone
B001KMB6X2|5.0|I have watched this movie at least 10 times, and i have loved it everytime.  It's one of those rare movies that you really don't belive you like until your watching it a third, fourth, and fifth time.  The all of a sudden your like \\"Wow, I guess this movie is ok\\", well thats what has happen to me.  I found myself plopping it in when its noting on TV just to go to FICTION LAND!  Good movie not great but, if you drop your expectation you will be surprised what you see!
B00BJW6YW6|2.0|When I heard the single, &#34;Open&#34;, last year, I thought Rhye was an artist who showed a lot of promise.  The songs on this album are okay, but the instrumentation and production is so simple and boring.  Nothing against a bare bones approach, but music should be more than just a frame for vocals.  Wish it was more interesting throughout.
B007BRJYF2|3.0|Run of the mill ANUMAN HO game, with a lot of easy to not-so-easy mini-puzzles, too.  Lots of hints, and you may really need them.  Some of the objects are teensy!  But it is a HO game, after all.  Things are supposed to be hard to find!  I don't see how anyone could play some scenes on a phone screen (like painting the roses red).  This has some beautifully colorful scenes, and I enjoyed the music.  Another reviewer mentioned the obnoxious buzzer; I just turned the sound effects way down 'cuz I didn't like it either.  This version of  'Alice' may not take you to Wonderland, but it will occupy your mind for a couple of hours. And again, I had no problems whatsoever on my Kindle.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|This is a very nice file manager. It's easy to use. I gave it 4 stars because it's not as useful as Astro File Manager.
B007H746AY|5.0|This movie holds up over the years.  Kathy Bates is fantasticly frightning in her roll.  The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|unique way to link his two favorite characters in one story.  well written.  I have also recommend the book to others
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|this processor is simple amazing nothing more to say. I have skype on, downloading a game, playing tf2, and have itunes open and the cpu usage is 9 percent, i call that amazing. perfect for anything. i would highly recommend this cpu to anyone
B006LSZECO|4.0|Must read book that is pretty twisted.  Being married creates a true understanding of how twisted it really is.  Good.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Sixpence...love...kept you interested at all points...sometimes too overwhelming with history and chemistry...but even if you couldn't understand it all it was entertaining
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|The game is awesome. You are a floating orb and you grow by absorbing orbs that are smaller than you. Orbs that are bigger than you will absorb you. The orbs are flying in space and you move by releasing mass (you get smaller the more you accelerate). Some levels include gravity which is very well done. Some levels are very tricky but the game gives you the option to skip them if you want. As I have never done that I don't know what would happen as far as overall progress in the game goes.<br /><br />The game is highly addictive and very well made. I got this for free as the app of the day but it's totally worth the three dollars. I have played for a few hours(!!) now and judging from the level guide I am far from done. My guess is you could probably get at least 5 to 10 hours of pure playing time out of this game without even touching the arcade mode.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|Ever wonder why the people in Zombie movies act like they've never SEEN a zombie movie? I'm enjoying the series,don't get me wrong.Sometimes,though,it's facepalm time!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love Book 2 almost more than than I loved Book 1. I cannot wait to read Book 3. I am starting it NOW!!
B009POCG0Y|5.0|Excellence in low-down tawdry suspense - Well, there's just not enough of that around.  Wish I'd seen it when if first hit the theaters.  Great ensemble piece, beautifully acted, directed, shot, edited and written. Thrilling, suspenseful, beautifully paced 'freak show' of the underside.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Been reading a lot about Navy Seals lately and this was really an inspiring and emotional story.  Many of these men have great stories to be told, but this one certainly has a level of amazement that will not disappoint.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|A few months ago, a friend suggested that I watch Doctor Who as something to fill in my evenings.  I had previously watched the first series of the new show, featuring Eccleston, but couldn't get into series two.  So, running back in I skipped one, jumped straight into series two and haven't looked back<br /><br />In the sixth series, you can tell that the show has hit its stride  The characters are comfortable with each other, the situations are novel but not completely over the top, and we see a portrayal of the Doctor that returns a bit of 'otherness' to the role (almost blending the portrayal of Eccleston and Tenant).  Simply put, this is a great example of contemporary science fiction that is fully supported with a budget behind the show, talented writers and directors, and actors who can carry the scenes.  I would put more, but I think part of the fun is watching Doctor Who and not knowing what to expect.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|If you were to try and tell this story to a friend they probably wouldn't believe you.  I picked up the book and read the intro late one night after my brother left it.  Needless to say I was up late reading and finished in a short time.  Deadly serious, but with some good comic relief when needed.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Gameloft has some good games as I have seen so far.  Patience is a must if you want to get anywhere without giving up real cash.
B002L3ARRU|5.0|This movie was great and fantastic and changed my life.  It played well, didn't skip at all and loaded fine.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book explains so much about survival. The desperation, sacrifices, and resourcefulness all wrapped neatly into 300 pages. .....with a dash of horror.<br /><br />Jyoesting
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is so,so,so much better then temple run if this cost $30 I would still get it. btw you mite get addicted to this game
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Good easy read with interesting characters and plot.  A bit different from a typical Nicholas Sparks book. Go for it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have played this game for years. I like the challenge. I do recomend this to everyone. I love it.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|You will experience a wide range of emotions when you read this book. An honest look into a life changed by Christ. He assuredly heard &#34; We'll done , my good and faithful servant.&#34;
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It is easy to use and it works on my Kindle even thought it is over 3 years old.<br /><br />The old style was constructed in a manner that bent  when it was inserted.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|Wonderful collection of long and short stories. Easy to read on the Paperwhite Kindle since any challenging words can be easily defined without loosing the literary flow.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I have always enjoyed reading stories that take place in the South in the 1800s. I found the authors notes very interesting at the end of the book.
B000PY6BBI|5.0|I watch this one once every two years of so. I've never really grown tired of it. So, see it.
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|The research and examples contained in Paul Tough's work, are rich with opportunities to operationalize and begin shifting the national metacognitive lexicon of child development/education. His robust exploration of interdisciplinary reasearch lends credibility and counterbalances what at times comes across as a singularly prescriptive voice. A recommended read for every parent, educator, policy maker or interested party.
B00BN2NY48|4.0|A good mixture of performances from the various Las Vegas shows with the usual surreal qualities found in Cirque performances.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|I've taught writing classes of all kinds, this movie is nearly a completely perfect<br />example of story structure in and of itself.  It's also heart breaking, and if you're<br />even remotely into videogames, prepare to go into happy overload, because there<br />is some legit stuff in every frame.  EVERYTHING, even the way the &#34;rules of the movie&#34;<br />work.  This must have been a licensing nightmare.  And if you've never touched a video<br />game, you'll it just the same.  I'd give it 6 if I could.<br /><br />Easter eggs EVERYWHERE ...
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|A good story line and animation. A nice family movie, if families every see movies together anymore, that is. It would be nice to think so.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is probably the best sandbox game yet. It is great to scavenge for food, build houses, and do everything else. What can improve your Minecraft experience is playing with another person. I played with my sister and that doubled the fun and excitement. We could play until our Kindle Fires went ka-put.<br /><br />One thing though: Playing on a Kindle Fire may be found a wee bit cramped. If you have a regular iPad, I would recommend getting it on that. Same price, but a bigger screen.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was a great start and middle, but I just didn't like the ending...<br />The whole book was unexpected with awesome twist and turns and held my attention and interest...and then the ending just didn't do it for me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I don't have no glitches no problemes no loss of data! I would reccomend this game.but I will warn u its deducting!but fun.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I could not put this book down! I was hoping for a different ending, left me hanging a bit but still a great read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The graphics are amazing, I think the horse is going to trample me:)<br />I love the competitions and the games, but my favorite thing is probably making the food
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|Great book it captured the difficult times that some people had to face in the 1930s in the great depression
B002R5V7MG|4.0|This was generally a very good DVD, and I find myself agreeing to some extent with the other reviewers saying that the Mahler was too slow; however, the final ten minutes were worth the wait.  I can just imagine what it must have been like to hear it in the Hall!  On a technical point, the specs here on Amazon say that it has an aspect ratio of 1.33:1, but it is actually 1.78:1.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Like it alot! Works as advertized! I like the way it shows diff networks overlapping and signal strengths. Great App!
B00992CF6W|4.0|this is I think an awesome app and smaller version of minecraft but get some wolves and ocelets in there!!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|installed into my asrock extreme77 with no issues at all, i can run 20 tabs in firefox and have multiple games open and the cpu usage rarely goes above 20%<br />i havent even overclocked it yet but from what i understand it can easily reach 4 ghz
B009AMANH4|2.0|A great story badly told. A collection of some of the lamest scenes over directed for the sake of audience emotions. My favorite bad sketch is baldy Tommy Lee Jones in bed with his mistress. \\"read it read it now touch it touch\\". I mean, really. Another great ball of corn is the opening \\"could you hear my speech\\" scene. Sally Fields performance would make me think Booth just had bad aim. Did Sally get a new set of teeth from Aardman? Also, could the cinematographer hold the camera still for one second, I was getting slow motion sickness. Dull I can handle, cliched not so much.
B004XQO90O|3.0|I enjoyed \\"Source Code\\", don't get me wrong.  But I just felt that it was overhyped and increased my expectations to the point that I was inevitably let down.  I cared about Jake Gyllenhall's character but couldn't muster caring about the other character's in the doomed story (with the exception of Vera Farmiga's cold Lt. Colleen Goodwin who was always played as more than she seemed).  The time-shifting sci-fi bend ended up feeling more like a contrivance on how to tell a who-dun-it murder mystery and in true Hollywood fashion the protagonists find their happy ending (this film would have been better leaving it a tragedy).<br /><br />Maybe see it if you're in the mood for a twist on how to find the mass murderer type of movie but don't go into it looking for any wowza sci-fi.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|when ever I try to go to the menu an add pops up if I try to click something on the menu an add pops up why? other than that I LOVE this game o have 40 eggs already I want to get them all
B007VUA7VO|5.0|funziona, facile da usare, funzioni essenziali e sopratutto attendibili, se ti dice che la batteria dura 2h e 15, quello è davvero il tempo residuo. aiuta molto a regolarsi, a gestire lo stand by, le applicazioni e, in breve, il trailer (e anche il telefono, direi). grande cosa, più di ogni altra? è gratis.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I am so addicted to this game.  I love the challenge as well as the eye-catching colors of the cube.  You can play this game in 3 ways \\"cube attack\\", \\"game mode\\" and \\"one Minute mode\\".  Great game to keep the mind and reflexes sharp.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|typical Clancy,good book . Not predictable, keeps you guessing till the end. I have all Jack Ryan books that he has authored
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is a great game. It takes a while to get the hang of it but is very addicting. Great job to the developers.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I like Ben Affleck. He is very a talented actor and director.  This story is overall good. But I think there is a flaw in the movie and make me questioning about the authenticity.<br />Every person when you pass through the custom, there is a record of you entering the country or leaving the country.  The plot I couldn't understand is how Tony Mendez managed to have all six faked passports existed in Iran custom system that they have entered into the country. Maybe in those early years, fake stamps on the passports is able to fool the custom.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great story - I love an unexpected ending.  Should make for good discussion at book club, and I'm not usually into crime books.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I love the movie.  Got almost to the end and got ticked, lol, but its got a great ending.  The only one it could have.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My brother and I both love this game. It is good for the whole family. Its is a great game.
B000K4WPCC|5.0|I love this movie.  Its nice to see a &#34;guy&#34; movie that is based on just that.  Makes for a great fun movie.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|the application is well created. the many versions of the Bible cater to the diverse population. I enjoy the many versions of the Bible and the historic times in when it was written. the interpretations from one to another is fascinating. you need this app.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|there are no instructions and I have to tap repeatedly to get response. There is no understanding the game. This is stupid.
0061998494|5.0|Very witty book, written in Craig's irreverent way. Reccommend it to anyone with a warped sense of humour. Good belly laugh.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app so fun to play and visit friends with its great name sure to plug your kindle or phone in though
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Enjoyed each of the books in the series. Premise, and involvement of the different groups of characters kept it very interesting.  Liked the Dragon interactions.  Looking for more.
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|Just wish it were in English. But loved the movie.Would reccomend it to anybody. As long as you do not mind reading
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|this game is awesome!!! but how are you suppose to get dinosaurs do you have to be a certain level or something
B008JFUNAU|5.0|This prequel was amazing and the perfect way to restart the movie even possibly making room to turn it into a trilogy!! If you haven't seen it do it's a must in 3D!
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|Turn off the sound and enjoy the costumes and the wonderful set.  You can do other things while doing other tasks and have an occasional look at the screen.  Otherwise, this film is a TOTAL banal bore.  It just doesn't work.
4805311193|5.0|One of the better books about the Shinsengumi. Pretty hardcore details. End to end reading at its finest. The book reveals the rise and fall of the group, from its humble beginnings to its downfall.
B00AW8VUDG|5.0|Krokus Is One Of My All time Favorits and This Album Is No Different. Great Classic Sound,Cool Riffs and Great Vocals. A Must Have

B000FCKC4C|2.0|Nothing in it for personal growth. I am sorry that people are asked to believe in omens and hunches especially when you have to make critical life decisions. My advise is to read it and forget it.
B0013N7AD8|5.0|Comic book characters are flamboyant, larger-than-life 'fictional' characters that are usually served best when handled that way. Hence my preference for Burton's vision of Batman over the superficial reality of Nolan's vision. Don't get me wrong though, because Christopher Nolan's movies are high quality sophisticated masterpieces, for sure. But in reality Batman would be a short lived joke, the guy would probably end up dead within a month, if not sooner.<br /><br />Batman is not super-human, so I can't buy into Nolan's Batman anymore than I can Burton's. The difference being that I'm having more fun watching Burton's theatrical fantasy version, over Nolan's pseudo crime/super hero realism. Watching Batman and his crazy costumed friends running around Chicago, as opposed to Burton's beautifully realized Gotham City for example, is just one of the many reasons why I wasn't able to lose myself in Christopher's vision.<br /><br />But the biggest problem by far, is that the handling and portrayal of the character, betrays an underlying embarrassment of the source material... And with that out of the way, read on for a quick break-down of this cool Blu-ray box set.<br /><br />This box set contains beautiful transfers of all four films, the inky black palettes of Batman and Batman Returns are sublime, as are the vivid neon palettes of Batman Forever and Batman & Robin.<br /><br />But be warned - Tim Burton's Batman and Batman Returns are dripping in black and will make a mockery of your LED/LCD screen if it isn't set up right i.e. perfectly. But even then, to truly enjoy the picture as it was intended, a quality plasma screen is absolutely essential.<br /><br />The audio is excellent and presented in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 with optional Dolby 5.1 for evening viewing (very nice). But it is not truly dynamic enough, especially Schumacher's films, which is rather disappointing since I'm pretty sure Batman Forever ushered in the 5.1 digital audio age. On a very big plus note though, the spoken dialogue is crisp and clean throughout, something that very often gets overlooked unfortunately.<br /><br />The extras are worthy, even though there's nothing new over the previous DVD releases, and the packaging is nice too.<br /><br />As for the films themselves? Well, each to their own. For me Batman Returns is still my all time favorite Batman film, it has beautiful sets, gorgeous art design, expertly crafted characters and superb costumes with a quality script delivered perfectly by all involved that make this film the clear winner for me. A close second is the original 1989 Batman followed by the bad, but kinda fun & flamboyant Batman Forever.<br /><br />Batman & Robin gets it's own paragraph here, because it is a nasty movie that at certain points becomes painful to watch, this one really hurts the franchise. The third act is especially atrocious and just plain woeful, hence this movie easily falls into fourth place. Having said all that, Batman & Robin is the best one for kids, probably (hopefully) because it's intentionally a kid's movie, so it does have it's purpose. It's just a shame that Mr Freeze was wasted on this title.<br /><br />SUMMARY<br /><br />Video: 9/10 - I'm really splitting hairs here...the picture quality isn't up there with other older titles released on Blu-ray, like Blade Runner for example. Even so, the movies are still gorgeous regardless of my less than perfect score.<br /><br />Audio: 8/10 - Not truly dynamic enough, still excellent, just not reference quality, close though.<br /><br />Extra content: 8/10 - I'd have given this score a 10/10 if these extras were more than just carry overs from the previous DVD releases of these films. Excellent otherwise.<br /><br />Tim Burton's genre defining classics and Joel Schumacher's fun romps are a must buy here, yes, even Batman and Robin. And if you've never experienced Batman before Christopher Nolan's take on the character, this is the ideal place for the main course. The A/V improvements of this Blu-ray set over the DVD set are enough to warrant the purchase, just don't pay more than the RRP because I'm guessing it won't be long before Warner Bros re-releases this set.
B0054SMID0|4.0|McConaughey gives a great performance! The plot of the story keeps viewers wondering of what is happening next, also who can resist McConaughey's charm and good looks!

B00475AYJQ|3.0|I finished reading the first book of the Kingkiller Chronicles and was so looking forward to the 2nd book. But this book was a huge let down. The story didn't progress at all and it makes me upset that the publishers or the author have obviously forced a trilogy where there is none.
B001NOQI3U|5.0|Traditionally, society has been the master of everyone and limits an individual's abilities to their stereotyped expectations. Even in so-called free societies, people are confined to a certain status. Had Yentl not become a him, as Anshel, she could have never entered the ranks of the more progressive thinkers who by social decree had to be male. Watching her skills in handling the challenges of her male role was intriguing as long as this cinema critic could overlook her not being noticed for her femininity. However, there are guys who have the same mannerisms and features society has marked as girlish, and some gals could definitely be seen as guys in certain settings. So Yentl's portrayal of a guy is not that farfetched. It is society that really has the blind eyes in not acknowledging these stereotypical contradictions and letting people achieve the goals that could enrich all of us to a higher state of mind. This is the spirit of this movie to me. Just let everyone be the best person they are, no matter how much, if any, their orientation differs from their stereotype. I rooted for Yentl, as the under-dog, to succeed in her quest for equality and cringed at some of the things she had to put up with in order to stay the course. She may have not changed any one else, but that is not the point. She changed her world, the only one she actually had the stewardship rights.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|What fun it is!  Once you start playing, it is hard to stop.  Very smooth gameplay and it makes you feel so darn pleased when you connect those dots.
B004UPAIKI|3.0|I'm not sure why I've never seen this movie before... The story is really great and has the ability to grab the viewer. Acting is average.
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|The single best story I have ever come across. The book is astounding, and the movie follows suit, Pretty good for what was called &#34;the unfilmable book&#34;!
B00622BMOS|5.0|This show is absolutely awesome! It's very addicting and although it is not how hospitals function in real life it still gives a good insight on how stressful these jobs truly are and the challenges interns and the most skilled doctors face. I have only seen it a couple of times for no more than a few minutes when it came out on tv but boy was I missing out! I am now on season 2 which alone has about 27 episodes! I'm sure all of y'all will find this show addicting and satisfying if you so choose to watch it!
B003QSMCKO|5.0|My favorite animated Disney movie of all time! Strong protagonist, lovely artwork, wonderful music & everything else you could ever hope for in a Disney movie.
B001FB55H6|4.0|Product came in plastic wrapping. Brand new quality, never had been opened. The quality of the movie itself is pretty nice and clear, but I've seen better, more high quality versions of blu-ray on other movies. I'd give it a 9/10 for visual. Found it on other websites or stores for around 20 bucks. Worth the buy if you're into owning hard copies of movies.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|I feel like there was a lot more they could've done with this, which would've given the story more diversity. TONS of video game worlds are available to you, but you really only see three? Let down.<br />There was also very little emotional pull for me, though I really feel like, again, there was enough potential for it. Just unused potential, it seems.<br />The animation is good & the basic storyline is solid, I just wish it would've packed more of a memorable punch.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Overall the game is addictive, entertaining, and generally fun play. The mini games keep you busy while you wait to regain energy. The game could use some tweaking because it tends to lag at times. ALSO  the competitions could be harder and more interactive.
B005DOL0R0|4.0|This product was sent to me very quickly.  It was not the type I wanted, however.  I wanted a solid sided holder and this one was soft sided.  The seller sent me exactly what I ordered.  I have no issues or problems with this seller.  The exceeded my expectations but I had ordered the wrong product.
B007REV4YI|5.0|For the first time in 22 movies, Bond breaks with the tradition of being mentally invulnerable. Being shot and seriously injured, his recovery takes its toll from his spirit and far from the prying eyes of MI6 he succumbs to booze and self pity. It is not fully clear whether his unsteady hand is due to the alcohol or that it is a consequence of his injury, but fact is that it strongly influences his reflexes and therefore the essence of the Bond character. Even so, Bond averts the threats of exposing all Secret Service agents worldwide. The villain in Skyfall is a product of an Agent gone wrong, presumably on account of misjudgments by M (Judi Dench).<br />M. plays an exceptionally large part in this movie, which is to be her last Bond performance.<br />The ending is less victorious and pompous than usual but certainly more credible.<br />A movie worth watching and definitely a very good Bond at that.
B00AKEMHCA|2.0|i dont know im mean its kinda cool but its not as good as all the other ones its to different from the  other ones and its to easy
B008I3RARW|1.0|Yeah so I downloaded it as the free app of the day.  I tapped on it.  So it comes to the main screen.  I tried pressing &quot;New Game&quot; and it didn't even work.. I don't know how I'm supposed to play it!!  GRRRRRRRRRRR

B00555X8OA|3.0|As a former grad student in Psychology I'm used to reading lots of data with not much in the way of clear conclusions. That would be true here as well. Kahneman does as well as anyone in describing the complexity of human thought using concepts and categories that make it somewhat easier to comprehend but it's still human behavior and is just not easily understood. I found a lot of the ideas interesting and he certainly makes his case about the fallibility of human judgement. It just takes a while. If you're willing to plow through all the verbiage you will come away with a deeper but still very incomplete understanding of cognition.

B0041IXVIK|4.0|One of the biggest problems I had with \\"Predator 2\\" was that it abandoned the atmosphere of the original \\"Predator\\" movie. As for the AvP movies, forget it.<br /><br />Well, \\"Predators\\" has a completely different cast and setting from the original... yet it successfully captures that grimy, sweaty, blood-stained jungle quality. The difference this time is that all the humans are also vicious killers of one kind or another, and strong performances by Adrien Brody, Alice Braga, Laurence Fishburne and the rest keep us invested despite the nastiness of some characters.<br /><br />Eight people find themselves parachuted into an unknown jungle: Royce, an American mercenary (Brody); Isabelle, an IDF sniper (Braga); Hanzo, a yakuza enforcer (Louis Ozawa Changchien); Nikolai, a Spetsnatz soldier (Oleg Taktarov); Mombasa, a Sierra Leone death squad member (Mahershalalhashbaz Ali); Cuchillo, a cruel cartel thug (Danny Trejo); Stans, a serial killer on death row (Walton Goggins), and a seeming harmless doctor named Edwin (Topher Grace).<br /><br />At first, the eight people have no idea who they are doing there, or how they came to be there. They have even more questions when they realize that this jungle isn't even on Earth.<br /><br />But that isn't their biggest problem: someone is following them through the jungle, and slaughtering these seasoned killers one by one. Also, there's a crazy guy (Laurence Fishburne) who may be a lot more dangerous than he seems. Their only chance of survival is to somehow kill the alien Predators that are following them -- assuming they don't kill each other first.<br /><br />When I first heard of \\"Predators,\\" my first thought was that it sounded more like a remake than a sequel. But it does successfully twiddle the original formula -- the humans are all professional killers, none of them know each other, and there is no safe haven for them unless they are able to somehow get a spaceship. Even the \\"obfuscate the heat vision\\" scene is turned on its head.<br /><br />But at the same time, director Nimr&oacute;d Antal and producer Robert Rodrieguez GET it. They know why the original movie worked, and they successfully twiddle the formula without losing what makes it good. The story is simple and mostly straightforward (with a few easy-to-predict twists), with the sweaty, bloodstained atmosphere of people trapped in the jungle.<br /><br />The one big problem? Well, halfway through the movie we're introduced to the idea that there are different breeds of Predator, and they hunt each other as well as other species... it's never explained enough. It's a bit confusing.<br /><br />I was initially skeptical of the casting of tall, skinny Adrien Brody as the lead character, but he's frankly pretty awesome -- a lean, wiry, cold-as-ice guy who has a soft spot for \\"nice\\" people. The gravelly Batman voice is a little off-putting, though. We get it, you're tough.<br /><br />And the other actors all do brilliant jobs, fleshing out their characters -- each one gets pros and cons to their personality, no matter how repulsive they may be. Braga and Taktarov are especially good as the only \\"good\\" people in the group, who seem to have stable compassionate personalities, while Changchien manages to make a likable, interesting character out of only a handful of lines and a truly awesome kendo duel. And yes, Grace has a wonderfully chilling performance set apart from the assorted soldiers and enforcers.<br /><br />\\"Predators\\" catches the tone and atmosphere of the original \\"Predator,\\" then twists around the entire formula. Brilliant acting and a simple, solid story.its head.<br /><br />But at the same time, director Nimród Antal and producer Robert Rodrieguez GET it.

And yes, Grace has a wonderfully chilling performance set apart from the assorted soldiers and enforcers.<br /><br />\\"Predators\\" catches the tone and atmosphere of the original \\"Predator,\\" then twists around the entire formula. Brilliant acting and a simple, solid story.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great Read!!!!! I couldn't put it down. I would definitely recommend it to everyone who has read fifty shades. Awesome
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book is a thriller. As you turn each page you get closer and closer to figuring out the truth as to what exactly happened the night of the murder's. You form your own opinion just as the main character Libby Day does. At the very end there is a twist the story that you never would have seen coming. Definitely a must read!
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I. Really. Like. It.  It's just you. Can't. Race  there. Is a timer  for how b long you can move. So
B003IY49S4|5.0|What can you say, this is the best jazz compilation set extant.  It is arranged in chronological order which is nice.  I'm a total beginner with jazz and can't but this down.  Highly recommended!

B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Though I do love all of the characters in this series, the first season was much better.  Jessica Lange puts on another awesome performance.
B00AKOB7CG|3.0|this book is very good for people who are just starting out .I find that it was more for women than men.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Ted is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a very long time.  I love that it's set in Boston and pokes fun at Boston (as a resident of Cambridge myself)!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book was an amazing blend of humor, humility, and the hostility of war from Chris' viewpoint. It was complemented by the realistic viewpoint of  the families our service men and women leave behind to carry on and survive their own version of the war.<br /><br />After I started reading the book, I learned of Chris Kyle's tragic death. Along with the rest of a grateful country, I mourn his loss and extend deepest sympathies to his family.  After reading his book, however, I can envision him making the best of it with the good friends who preceded him and imagine his \\"back room\\" talk ending with the words \\"well done, Chris.\\"
B008861R7S|5.0|(This review is for the Chess Box Edition)<br /><br />Any hip-hop enthusiast will tell you that Liquid Swords is an undeniable masterpiece, and they would be more that right. Quite possibly the best post-Wu-Tang release (with Return to the 36 Chambers close behind) Liquid Swords is a mammoth release no matter what year or decade you choose. It's dark atmosphere and dreary lyrics that used classic, obscure martial arts/samurai films as an archtype only served to seperate it from the rest of the rap community. And now, it gets the deluxe treatment in the form of a chess box.<br /><br />What you get is an actual chess set (made of real wood!) and a second disc of instrumentals. It is disappointing that there weren't any b-sides or remixes to accompany the extras on the second disc, but collectors or Wu-Tang probably won't care either way. The same can be said for the booklet. You get only 3 pages devoted to the making of the album, plus live memorabilia supplements. Again, it's too bad there wasn't more to bite into, but it is what it is.<br /><br />When all is said and done, this is a well made box set, but only for the hardcore fan. Casual listeners would do well to get the original release, that is, unless you happen to be looking for a chess set as well.....

B00AAX68HG|5.0|This is a fun game for all ages. The puzzles are challenging enough for adults and the characters are silly enough to keep my 2 year old amused for some time.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Great if you want a dictionary if your reading and you don't know what the word is you hold on the word and it gives you choices for different things.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I go the cd pretty quickly. It is amazing! She is so talented and my sons think she's realy cute! :)
B0091REZMW|4.0|Good game but it doesn't explain much on the events that are on the right of the screen other than that it is fun.
0525423281|2.0|According to Goodreads stats, over 23,000 people rated this book and currently ending up with the average total of 4 stars (really like it). Looks like I'm in the minority.<br /><br />I was quickly annoyed by Lola's character. Her reminiscent days with dear handsome Cricket turned into a whining song throughout the book. She was definitely different from others all right. It seemed like she tried so hard to be out of the box that she ended up being a wishy washy and unfaithful person. Bummer!<br /><br />The love triangle story here just didn't click for me. Also, I'm not sure how accurate of a depiction of a teenage spirit this was. Perhaps, I'm just hoping this isn't what I have to look forward to when my six year old daughter turns 16. She'll be an angel, right? But seriously, the flaw in the book was character quality and not Ms Perkins's writing style. There was fine writing that outfitted each character with adequate depth. That's why I'm able to be critical of Lola.<br /><br />Overall, this companion book didn't measure up to it's predecessor Anna and the French Kiss in quality story.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|The series really picks up in this book. My only problem is some of his transitions between scenes are not there but other then that a great read.
1885167776|5.0|This booked has helped me become clearer on my purpose, identify steps toward the realization of my goals in my work & personal worlds. I highly recommend it for anyone that doesn't want to leave this world one day without becoming every speck of what you're intended for!
B005OZE9SA|5.0|I had this interface for a few months now and I have to say its pretty impressive. I will get to chase It works great for vocals, guitar,bass, piano anything like that(Not drums obviously because theirs only two inputs)Its gives a very crisp truthful sound, my friend has the Tascam us 1800 which is not a bad interface either but this ones still crisper. Now if your a drummer I would get something different just because you will probably need at least 6 inputs, depending on the size of your kit. But if you just need a sleek basic well built interface this is the one for you,you wont be disappointed!!!

B00AHTYGRW|5.0|I can see why there were so many nominations.  I love this movie.  Not a huge Ben Affleck fan....but have to give him props.
1401324649|3.0|This is one hoot of a book!  Very entertaining from the first page.  I laughed repeatedly and sometimes uncontrollably, though I think I laughed the most when reading Chapter 25 (there are 29 chapters plus an epilogue).  The added tidbits of history weaving through the tale are also quite interesting.  For those interested in plot details, please read other reviews.  It sufficies to say that this book should appeal to anyone looking for a light-hearted read for a vacation or a long airplane ride, or as a break from more serious reading.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 seems to be going along antaganizingly slow...true to WD fashion...BUT, it reamains as addictive as ever, so true fans enjoy!

Read a sample!<br /><br />Oh did I mention this series ROCKS!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My grandson loves this horse.  He's just fascinated that he can make it do things.  It really is cute, even though we don't really play for levels (and they might confuse me, but I don't get a turn often, and we may not be able to proceed very far, but he's very entertained for what he can do.  I think all little girls and maybe tweens or young teens who want a horse would enjoy this.  I know I'd have loved having an interactive virtual horse would have been great - or at least a lot better than what I did have (nothing).
B0036T31YY|5.0|After reading many excellent reviews of this movie, I expected this movie to pack quite a punch. Let me tell you: It delivered a big punch.<br /><br />Without giving away any spoilers, I think the movie was well written, great directing, excellent acting and an overall great movie. What's more impressive is that this movie was working with only a $12 million budget, so it's even more impressive and you can definitely tell the money was well spent.<br /><br />The movie was definitely complex and has a lot of subtle connections throughout. Towards the end of the movie, things start making more sense and you get goose bumps as the story unfolds.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really like this game .<br />Seeds to go to<br />nyan - lava<br />jpgaming - mine straight down from spawn point and get iron then coal then diamonds.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|The new Temple Run 2 is simply amazing. I am pretty much addicted to playing it. I recommend it to anyone and everyone.
B003XRELGQ|4.0|Vonnegut's derision of conventions, from science to religion, is done with irony and humor. Enjoyable and worth reading, especially if the reader has the time to try to understand more of the author's thinking processes and/or messages.
B004H0M8EA|4.0|I read this after watching 180 Degrees South, in which it was referenced during the Easter Island stop.  While reading, I'd get caught up in each societal collapse, and find myself reading more online or watching movies (like Mutiny on the Bounty) of the stories referenced.  That's the sign of a good book, right?
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|Just as dull and stupid as the rest of the Daniel Craig bond movies.  Another disappointment.  Major plot holes.  Character motivations are hollow and unsatisfying.
0307341550|5.0|It`s been a long time since I`ve read a book that I`ve been unable to stop thinking about once I finished reading it.Sharp Objects is one. When I began reading,I was gobsmacked by Gillian Flynn`s style.The prose was stunning. I felt as if I were right there with Camille Preaker and what a tortured, yet sympathetic soul, she was.To me the many flawed characters were reminiscent of some of the characters in books written by southern authors like Tennessee Williams and Truman Capote.I wondered if this might be one of my favorite books ever and I couldn`t wait to return to it.Granted,I had to skim the part concerning the hog farm.Being an animal lover and a pork eater, it was horrifying to me.It made me feel very different about meat eating. Could Ms. Flynn be a vegetarian? As in Gone Girl,it was the ending that made me feel this was not my favorite book, but I will never forget this book and I will never forget Camille Preaker. I finished the book yesterday and I had to stop myself from reading it again today just to concentrate on the writing style rather than the plot. It took some self discipline.With nine hundred + reviews, no need for a synopsis. This is my attempt to get this book out of my mind.Do I recommend it? Oh yeah,any small negatives are so outweighed by the positives.
B009CPE424|1.0|I suppose there should be some gratitude that most of the voice cast from the second movie returned, my advice is to wait for this disaster to come on cable if you really want to watch it.

B00A8MGIZG|5.0|Maybe this film was more for New Agers and New Thought thinkers.  I loved it.  It has meaning on so many levels.  After viewing I was reminded of \\"2001 Space Odyssey\\" with all its hidden meanings.  No, I didn't read the book, which is arranged differently, but for me, this was a Star!

B006VP1OYO|5.0|I completed missed this when it was released in 2012, but after 2013's release of the first new My Bloody Valentine release in 22 years. 2012 was such a disappointing year in music, so I wish this would have been on radar when it came out. All I can say is that this collection (even with both annoying versions of Slider and the two poor instrumentals) is maybe the best overall release by MBV. Granted, I am beyond burned out with Loveless (released by Senior year of high school) and while enjoying their latest release tremedously, think that about 1/3 of it wasn't worth a 22 year wait... so this factors in my high praise for Ep's 1988-1991. Kevin Shields, under all the noise and tremolo, was once a fantastic songwriter in terms of melody. I kind of wish he would get back into that aspect of songwriting again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun game.  I really like it. I have a great time playing. I hope you have fun.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|I had only viewed one episode of this series and that wa smore than enough to order it. (Plus, it was bloody cheap... $30.00 for 8 discs!) Hugh Laurie may forever be remembered as House, but prior to this introduction to America, Laurie was actually a fairly type-cast as a bumbler and a dimwit, with Bertie Wooster as his crowning achievement. Stephen Fry is brilliant as the &#34;straight man&#34; as butler Jeeves. He deftly helps Bertie navigate through the ridiculous social pressures of the idle rich. The show is brilliant on every level, and also a little painful because there are really people in the world who live like this.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I heard about this book from enough people that I finally had to see what the fuss was about. I can not recommend this book enough. I cried at the beginning and I cried again at the end. A wonderful read for all ages.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Buy this book!Definitely worth the money. If you don't believe me ask ask anyone. Truly the best  book ever!!! Get this book!!!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I knew before I saw the movie I was going to have to read the book (my own rule). As I started reading this book, I was drawn in. The story is beautfiully written (no surprise). The ending totally took me by surprise! I loved the story greatly!
B005LAIIGC|5.0|A fine movie that did not get the exposure or attendance it deserved based on the quality of the story, the animation, and the character building. It provided amusing spins on traditional holiday tropes and thus, kept the movie fresh for adults (my wife and I) as well as our two kids, 6 and 10. This movie bears up to repeated viewing.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Once you start reading the Harry Bosch series by Michael Connelly, you will get hooked. Bosch's mind is continually at work looking at all of the angles and hunches and The Black Box is a great example. Bosch proves that he has the ability to solve a cold case in which he had some personal involvement. Bosch is the kind of detective that skirts the boundaries of the rules and pushes the envelope. While he has some issues with authority, he also has concern and compassion for the victims. It's well worth the read as Michael Connelly weaves the story through its twists and turns.

B0030DBGXY|5.0|Pass on the other steels with the Cold Steel SRK.  The SAN MAI blade is WELL worth the little bit extra for this knife.  Nothing else needs to be said about the SRK, it has been around for years and traveled the world and has a well deserved great reputation.  The san mai steel only adds to the great knife to make it even better.  Wicked sharp, easy to resharpen and durable.  At first it may seem expensive then when you consider what you get, you get a bargin
B008JFUTT0|5.0|the real life is the fictive one, the one that we invent. The fact that Rodriguez refused a late, very late unexpected recognition as a superstar, and keeps wandering in Detroit to protect his authenticity is deeply touching me.

B003L77FYS|5.0|You've just gotta love all of the antics that Castle gets into and how Beckett just rolls her eyes!! And I love it when they get \\"going\\" on solving a case and they are really close to figuring out who did it and they start finishing each others theories! So Fun!!!

B009AMANBA|5.0|Lincoln is a superb film, in that it creates an atmosphere of what it most likely was like during the perilous time of the Civil War, and the effect it had on our president. With the 13th Amendment passage the number one priority of our president, and the dire outcome a failed bill would create, Lincoln puts the fate of the country and his administration on the line. Daniel Day-Lewis is the perfect choice to portray Lincoln, and his acting is nothing less that superb. He's in just about every scene in the movie, and it's impressive as to how much dialogue he had to memorize. Sally Field is the perfect (well not so perfect) Mary Lincoln. I absolutely love the settings in this film and the use of different lighting to create a somewhat darker visual tone to the movie. Add some cigar smoke-filled rooms and sunlight creeping in, and what you've  got is bringing the 1860s to life. The film ends with Lincoln's assassination, but Spielberg chooses not to show it, probably because most of us have already seen our share of re-enactments or simply that Spielberg was exercising an element of class. I will also say that this movie also shows a different side of Lincoln, and that is an occasionally humorous one. All in all, this movie works, and is particularly appealing to history enthusiasts, though children may find it a \\"Tad\\" boring.

B001BKG9SK|4.0|Just great. As always with David. However, it would be better to have additional sleeves for the disks which are stored only in paper pockets and could be easily damaged due to that.
1401307957|5.0|Reading his book got me to started doing some sketching around the house. The view to the kitchen, the dog and the cat. I don't think I'd draw the medicine chest - some things seem too banal to bother. But, it's all good practice in seeing because in order to get better at drawing you have to draw even when the subject is not inspiring. It's still a long way to warm weather and beautiful outdoor scenes. The act of making art is a tension reliever and meditative. Like the mantra of the some people today - &#34;It's all good&#34;.<br /> Danny Gregory shows that everybody has a worthwhile view and a story to show and to tell.
B008N5UX9M|3.0|I wish there was more Steve here, but in fact it is a mediocre neo-hard band from the UK featuring the legendary bassist and quite poorly recorded. For the lovers of genre or die-hard Maiden fans only.
B009K0OTVM|3.0|This is not a review for the Amazon stream but the series season.  I came initially to download a show because my dvr was on the fritz but its working now.<br /><br />REVENGE is one of my favorite shows and I don't watch many. I watch Game of Thrones, Downton Abbey, Breaking Bad and Boardwalk Empire right now.  Season 1 was excellent and kept me coming back every week.  Season 2 started out poorly with far too much going on that was difficult to follow.  The whole \\"The initiative\\" subplot has been a convoluted mess... not a bad idea, just poorly executed.  It's improved as the season has gone forward but too much of the show has been centered around the Grayson heir, Daniel, for a while now. Considering the fact that he's weak, fairly useless and the dimmest bulb on the show this might not be the best character to use as a conduit for Emily's revenge. Hopefully more focus will go to Emily, her sidekick Nolan, her childhood sweetheart Jack and the treacherous elder Graysons.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|It was an inspiring movie because it was based on a true story.  The plan to rescue the Americans was genius.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|A humble hobbit joins a band of dwarves who require a burglar to help them retrieve their lost birthright from a marauding dragon.<br /><br />Director and co-screenwriter Peter Jackson has launched another massive fantasy trilogy based on the work of J.R.R. Tolkien.  This time the source material is a comparatively thin volume, but Jackson has delved deep into Tolkien's elaborate appendices in order to expand it.  Is this a cynical cash grab intended to capitalize on the success of Lord of the Rings or a respectful attempt to bring Tolkien's world to life in the most fully-formed version possible?  For the studio, it's no doubt the former but I think for Jackson and his co-creators it is the latter.  I am in full sympathy with those who find this film bloated and  unwieldy, but I loved almost every minute of it and look forward to the inevitable expanded edition on DVD.  It's great to see such familiar faces as Ian McKellan, Hugo Weaving, Andy Serkis/Gollum, and (especially) Christopher Lee.  Martin Freeman makes the ideal Bilbo.  I am as excited to see the coming installments as I was after seeing The Fellowship of the Ring all those years ago.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love playing this game and how there is always something new to do. I think this is a great product and I would love to see Japan as the next stop in the world tour.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This game is great and addicting. The format and graphics are kewl beans. The buggy targets and loads concern me. Oh well still pay.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I loved this story right from the beginning I loved the candace of the writing. The characters were real and delightful. I definitely recommend this story even if you are not computer saavy. This story blends my love of books and love/hate relationship with the internet.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Hes a awesome singer but just wish you would of had the bonus cd with more songs on it ,, but I love it ,, and love his voice alot !!!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I can see why he won an Oscar for this. This movie was so believable and so scary!!!  I was on the edge of my seat.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I give subways surfers 5 stars!!! It updates by itself and it has New people with every update. Subwaysurfers is awesome!!! I Recommend it! And it is for any age from 1-100!!!
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|What About Now is a wonderful album every Bon Jovi fan should have in their collection! Check out their free new app! And defiantly keep a look out for concerts coming to a city near you!
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|This cd was delivered quick. The case was not cracked.The plastic wrapping cover the cd just like the store. Just like Superfly and Shaft soundtracks, just let it play straight. No skipping require.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Read the book; couldn't wait to see the movie.  It lived up to my expectations, although a couple of things in the book you'll only find in the outtakes on the DVD.
B00BSBY38A|1.0|The movie itself was excellent, plot was great and original.  Amazing visuals and stunning themes.  Amazons delivery ruined it for me though, which is why there is only one star.<br /><br />I rented this movie in HD because the visuals looked amazing in the preview.  This was the first movie I had rented in HD from Amazon.  I normally watch 1080 movies on Vudu and they run just fine.  The video quality started out great for the first 20 minuets, but after that it went down hill quickly.<br /><br />Multiple times throughout the movie the quality shot way down.  Amazons video quality indicator on screen would show low bandwidth so I would run a speed test at that time to determine if my provider was to blame.  I would get 40mbs down and 5mbs up while the video quality would remain very poor.  My TV was hard wired and not streaming over wireless.<br /><br />I wont be using Amazons service for HD anymore, this was very disappointing and a complete waste of money.  Oddly I haven't received an email from Amazon asking me to rate this movie (received one from Red Dawn which I rented yesterday, rented life of PI earlier this week) so I think they may know that they have problems with their HD streaming.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Easy to read,  full of adventure. Quite grim at times. But overall a good read for anyone looking for something interesting but not difficult or time-consuming to read
B008JFUTT0|5.0|After borrowing this movie from my local library I just had to own it.  Since then friends have borrowed it and I have not had a chance to get it back. May have to get a second copy!
0345529057|5.0|Hands down one of the best stories ever written. If you like the show then you will love these books even more.
B008QTV3X0|3.0|It just didn't hold my attn.<br /><br />The actors were good but for some reason it didn't do it for me
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|My fiancé and I are great together but we want to make sure our love will forever be. So we decided to read this book. I points out things that will help you in your relationship that needs work and for problems before they arise. Easy to read and understand. It's a must have.
B009O07NDY|5.0|My husband and I really enjoy the soundtrack...it's almost like watching the movie again and while most of the music is strong and powerful, it's also somewhat soothing (if it's not powerful, it's whimsical). :)
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|This definitely isn't one of the crazy games that is hard to focus and play because so much is going on.I love this game, and it is definitely worth a try. Thanks for the App of the Day!
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|my 2 year old granddaughter loves this movie she sets an d laughs at it ahe watches it 2 or 3 times a week. thank you
B0034G4P80|5.0|my 18 year old grandson wanted this movie and didnt want to pay the price in the store so i bought it for him he loves it.
B0034G4P26|3.0|Bought it for my 3 year old grandaughter, she didn't seem to be to interested in it. Recommend for older child.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|So far, so good. Roomy, flexible, adjustable. It has been protecting my DSLR & lens well so far. The price was good, too. What I really don't like is the Amazon mark on so many zipper pull-tabs. Very unattractive look.
0385366752|5.0|This book is one that after the first few chapters I could not put down! The story quickly evolves into a complex mystery with a range of viewpoints told. One of the best books I have read in a while!
B00BLGDFH2|5.0|Real, honest rock at it's greatest, with some of the greatest. Thanks Dave Grohl for being you. The music is honestly addictive.
0062124293|1.0|Very boring to read with immature attempts at humor regarding family dynamics and the awakening of sexuality in a schoolgirl
0765325950|5.0|This was a long series that never bored me.  I refused to re-read the 13 former novels (which I usually do with a series before I read the finale).  I found that I could drop right back into the book and be just as fascinated as I was from the beginning.  Am both glad and sad that we reached the finale.  Thanks to Brandon Sanderson for carrying on Robert Jordan legacy. Stunning.
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|Kid's loved it, I wasn't bored, a good night for the family.  Tim Burton weird but interesting and clean for the family.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Ok, it's about Lincoln fighting vampires during the Civil War, sounds dumb, but it works and was fun to watch.  Obviously not a epic blockbuster, but it's better than a grade B horror and was interesting and different.  Definitely a great rental.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Loved this book. Quick is a master of developing the characters. He made Pat so endearing, yet made me anxious.  I enjoy hope and silver linings. Well played.  Well played.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|what happens to humanity when we are brought back to our primitive state of mind/being?  This is what happens.  Great series
B007REV4T8|5.0|We were all excited to watch it a day earlier than it was coming out in the stores because my sons didn't get to see it yet. One of my sons is a die hard James Bind fan!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I just started watching the Walking Dead this year.  It is easily my current favorite.  I can't wait to see what happens tonight!
0307944689|2.0|I read it and took the exam! 75! It's not organized very well. Speaking and writing were completely confusing! Listening approach was wrong! don't waste your money!
B0053TMP24|5.0|I really loved the \\"moose pass gas \\" , the humor was great and well laid out,  i recommend to  the peeps that loved  the lost hero.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I loved this book , can't wait to read the next, I loved the humor and fantasy, I recommend to people who loved the Kane chronicles !
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like all the different puzzles. I like the fact that it is challenging and that there is no right or wrong answer. It is a lot of fun.
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|I love the book. I have read all of the Wimpy Kid books. Please write more Jeff.<br />I chose this because I loved it but I wish it was a longer story.<br />I love how these books are told by a kid's point of view.<br />I am going to recommend this book to my friend Tucker.
1616550414|5.0|All Zelda fans need to have this book, is so perfect in all aspects. I dont speak english. Bye Bye
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is sooooooooooo fun! You get to eat humans! P.s. careful for the people way inside the water they try to kill your shark! ;)
0316228532|3.0|This novel is depressing at best: the underbelly of a modern English village is enough to give a fan of Rowling's earlier efforts a migraine. Had real trouble finishing this book because I read for enjoyment and there was no fun in this story at all.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I love it and don't want to stop!  Addicting!  Keep trying to get each level until I get it.  Great!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I enjoyed this book because of the love between the kids. A dark subject though.<br /> Cancer is a tough subject.
1439152802|5.0|If you are considering this book, consider no longer--buy it. \\"The Secret Keeper\\" is simply wonderful, start to finish. I'm awed by Kate Morton's talent.
B001DM1VXE|5.0|digression first, why Pi should interest you beyond a fantastical story:    What if the world were completely governed by math?  Wait a minute, physics = applied math.  Basically, most physicists (theoretical or otherwise) buy into this.  Heck, anyone with a science background in their education knows this is the basis for all science.  Look at quantum mechanics and quantum physics: there was a proof of of the unifying theorems to be true, but I honestly didn't follow if peer review held up:    [...]    Even if not, the point is we keep finding mathematical equations that describe our universe given *some* assumption that usually doesn't quite hold.  This doesn't mean there doesn't exist some equation that perhaps is beyond our grasp.  A philosophical principle says we'll never know: if you are part *of* a system, you can never fully understand that system.  Take this example: if you are part of a 2D world, how can you understand and see it from a 3D being's point of view?  It's a little simple, but it's along those lines.  As 2D entities, we could probably make lots of observations, but our fundamental abilities to think and observe are limited.  We live in a world, a universe, a system that we are pieces of, part and parcel.  Remember Heisenberg's uncertainty principle?  Maybe just by thinking, and being aware of those thoughts, you changed something, very small, in this universe (part of you).    WARNING: direct spoilers avoided, but per usual, some references to movie content made that some may want to avoid.    Back to PI: it just takes the idea that a genius, Max, comes across a \\"magic\\" 216 digit number that is quite important.  Depending on your beliefs and interpretation, let's him completely understand this world, or see, or be \\"God\\".  Then he's got financial moguls and the Jewish religion after him.  Obviously they buy into this idea, too.    What makes the movie work in my opinion is basic (and sudden, last-minute) character transformation.  Watch it andyou'll see.  I personally can understand the moral (avoiding stating for spoiler reasons).  I don't agree, I'd personally prefer to understand, like Max :)    I've seen this 4-5 times, usually showing it to someone who has missed it or one of the generation younger than me.  It never gets old.    Oh, and it was made during the \\"golden age of electronica\\", so it's got a wicked soundtrack including songs by Orbital, Massive Attack, Clint Marshall, and more.  The music and cinematography also make the movie great to watch.  Max suffers from headaches ever since, as a child, he stared at the sun until he went (temporarily) blind.  With each headache, comes a blackout.  You feel and hear the pain.    Good stuff.  I highly recommend this.
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|Deny the naysayers. This is good, very good and certainly worthy of his legacy. Turn it up. As for the doubters, not sure what new stuff they're expecting from a fella that hasn't been around for many a year.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I recommend this book case for anyone with the Fire.<br />It came as promised and had everything included and it is PURPLE!!!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This game has me hooked.  Somehow for me the beginning levels are harder than the later ones in each section.  So after I get through the first few the next levels come easier and I get to the battles more quickly. Then it starts all over with a new set of skills to practice.
0671449028|1.0|Got for my 4 year old niece, such a silly book. Why are they all in the tub together and exercise after they shower? Not cute, sent back
B005YDLJ76|5.0|beyonce rules. the show was great LIVE and on dvd. I wish a bluray was released too. love it!! !
0140544518|2.0|Its a okay book for older kids, but it had a strange smell to it like old bad book, I had to send back
B00APAENUI|5.0|What more can you say.. One thing I do know. It is very very difficult to defeat a swordsman in the high guardsmen or horse stance when starting from low guard position.<br /><br />dray
B005K17RU0|5.0|Nothing worse than a radar that doesn't work on my Fire. Accuweather works and the site is less cluttered. Very colorful as well.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|It's been a long time since I've read THE HOBBIT.  I wasn't one of those who read it in elementary; my father first gave it to me then, but I didn't get into it.  Then The Fellowship of the Ring came out and I just had to read the books so I would know how it all turned out.  Waiting for the other two movies was not an option.  But yes, I started with THE HOBBIT.  I loved the books, but I haven't read them again since.  I'm not sure why.<br /><br />The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey - movie version - contained the two scenes not involving Smaug that I remembered most clearly, the trolls and the riddle game.  There were a few things that I knew were absolutely not in the book, such as there being both goblins and orcs.  (Also, a necromancer?  What?)  Other things I've found afterwards were small details in the book expanded to ten minute action sequences.  And that makes sense to me - action sequences play even better on the screen than in a novel.<br /><br />I honestly have no clue why Peter Jackson is turning The Hobbit into a trilogy.  I think most of the changes he made worked.  This version will tie in tightly to his Lord of the Rings.  But while I enjoyed this film, I have no clue how there is enough of THE HOBBIT left to make two more films.  But honestly, the man has delivered good films so far, so I am inclined to trust him.  I was quite wary of An Unexpected Journey, and then I absolutely loved it.<br /><br />Jackson has a knack for casting.  Even when I knew the faces, they tended to disappear into their roles.  I didn't realize Kili was Aiden Turner (Mitchell in Being Human) until the credits rolled.  And he's incredibly lucky, because apparently Elijah Wood, Cate Blanchett, and Hugo Weaving haven't aged in ten years.  It's uncanny.<br /><br />Although he adds in scenes to tie The Hobbit more closely to The Lord of the Rings, Jackson's adaptation proves that he understood the difference between the books.  This is a funnier movie, and he keeps several of the songs.  I am very tempted to buy the soundtrack.  I feel sorry for anyone in anyway related to high school band, because I am sure a large number of shows next year will be based on Howard Shore's score.  (I can still remember all of The Lord of the Rings shows I sat though in high school.  Thankfully my school couldn't afford the popular stuff.)<br /><br />I did attend a high-frame rate showing.  In case you haven't heard, Jackson shot The Hobbit at twice the usual frame rate.  Reports so far haven't been glowing.  I didn't hate it, but I didn't think it added anything to the movie.  (My dad concurs.)  It was most noticeable in brightly lit scenes.  If you ever watch making of documentaries, it looks like when they show bits of raw footage from angles that weren't used in the final film.  As for the 3D, it didn't really add anything either.  It's a beautiful film, but not one where things are leaping at you.  I highly recommend seeing it on the big screen, but I don't think you'll lose anything by attending an el cheapo 2D showing.<br /><br />If you were sitting on the fence, I say go for it.  It's a fun film.he songs.  I am very tempted to buy the soundtrack.

B0041KBWM0|5.0|Romola Garai was Emma!  I love the book (love all Austen's books) and this production evoked the best of the novel.  Perhaps because I love Austen, when I saw the Gwyneth Paltrow movie, I really liked it.  After I watched Romola Garai's Emma, I went back and watched the movie again.  No contest.  This production was superior, as was Garai.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|A friend suggested I read this book as I was dealing with my emotions during my mother's last two weeks of life.  She felt that it would help me by seeing my mother could be in a better place.  I'm not sure it did but it did make me realize that something else is out there.  The book was easy to read for half of it.  I felt the other half was written for Neurosurgeons.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|it kills time and is fin enough.  daughter likes it too.  Kindle fire games are ok.  God bless America.  will play this often
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play this game on my kindle fire and it works perfectly.I started the other<br />day and I haven't had a single glitch. My friends recomended me this game and<br />Its awesome.
1451648537|5.0|Walter Isaacson captures the genius, arrogance and flaws of Steve Jobs in this master biography of the man, his times and his machines. Jobs was a petulant tyrant and a brilliant perfectionist. His life's desire to create amazing products and to \\"put a dent in the universe\\" drove him to drive his engineers and marketing people to create products that ordinary human beings could use. For those of us frustrated with using the badly designed tools of the early computer age, he developed products - the Macintosh, the iPhone, the iPod and iPad - that we did not know we needed. And needing them, we wanted them.<br /><br />Isaacson captures the wounded, self-absorbed, self-contradictory maniac at the heart of this revolution. The barefooted, deodorant-eschewing child of the 60s became a world player and titan of industry. The hard-edged businessman would burst into tears when he couldn't get his way. The abandoned child became an abandoning father. Few holds were barred in this book.<br /><br />For those of us who came of age in the computer age, the book also brings the backstory of the development of beloved products. Usually, that involved Jobs seeing the work of others - Xerox's PARC, with its wonderful graphical interface, for instance - and recognizing ways to use it to make products that were far ahead of their time and gorgeously produced.<br /><br />Though the book suggests that Jobs' DNA has been built into the company he founded (then lost, then saved) it's hard to imagine Apple with Steve Jobs at the helm, bitterly castigating shoddy work and inelegant design until it was shorn of all that was inessential.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Very satisfied. I bought this one to replace my mixed collection of 1-5 I love that it is all one collection  !
B008JFUTT0|4.0|\\"Sugar Man\\" tells  the story of singer-guitarist Sixto Rodriguez, an impoverished Detroit musician who recorded an album or two in the 1970s and then dropped off the map. Rumors of his death were rife, if contradictory. By an odd twist of fate, his music reached apartheid-era South Africa, where it became wildly popular, becoming the anthem of many young whites who opposed their racist government.<br /><br />The worst part about the film is the trailer, which blows the film's central secret (avert your eyes if you don't want to know) that Rodriguez was still alive. The film follows his rediscovery, his triumphal tour of South Africa, and his return to Detroit.<br /><br />As a feel-good story, the film comes up a little short. Rodriguez, a shambling, mumbling, super hipster, seems satisfied with living in a bare apartment, warming himself with scrap lumber. He doesn't seem all that interested in moving out and up. And his music, with its 1970s folk feel, while good, might not be all that marketable today. \\"Searching for Sugarman\\" is structured as a feel-good story -- obscurity to fame to obscurity to (maybe) fame. The film clearly wants us to be blown away by his music. But the film's yearning  is hampered by its own hero. He, cool to the point of frostbite, could truly not care less if his music was loved and his talent appreciated. Is that too cool? Or just pathetic?
B009KS4XRO|5.0|LOV THIS APP IS FUN AND FAST PACE BINGO WITH EASY READING, AND EASY TO SEE BINGOS, UPDATES ARE QUICK AND EASY
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I haven't been so emotionally invested a novel since reading \\"The Name of the Wind\\" by Patrick Rothfuss. And I think Anthony Ryan does it better (that's very high praise indeed since it used to be my favorite novel). For those of you who are looking for something similar to what you just read, check Rothfuss out. Or if you have a recommendation for me, then leave a comment!<br /><br />I won't spend much time writing a comprehensive review since it's already been done and everything I would say has already been said. But I do want to add yet another five star rating because this book deserves them all. I cannot wait for the next installment.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|This is his imitation of his Alien trilogy work, it is trying to tell a story of the Sci-Fi interpretation of human origin, but it got too much of the old cliche built in, you almost can feel that Tony Scott run out of story to tell before movie's end.<br /><br />I can only say he is old, run out of fresh idea, it is a pity as I do enjoy his first and second Alien movie.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|So many songs, such a cheap price it's like paying for one album and getting three! Fast and well worth it
B00009P1O0|5.0|I think this album is Neil Young's social commentary of the 60s (or 70s?), His personal emotional recollection of the time, and very free of commercial influence of his work, Neil Young at his best barring his soul.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The app is fun to play and is what it says it is. The only thing that bugs me is the advertisements that pop up here and now. Other than that it's a perfectly fine app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Worth every minute!!!! I have been addicted to this game for months now!!!! I recommend this game for all ages...
B005U9RE1Y|5.0|I have loved this movie since I was a kid. And now my daugther loves it too. Such a great movie. The goblins kind of freaked her out at first but she kept watching now she loves it!!!!
B004BEMC6G|1.0|Right, let's see what type of people go for this gun-toting, sword-wielding, kick-boxing babe genre - Spotty adolescent boys who make plastic models of their super-heroines, lesbian feminists aka Amazonian fantasists, and male submissives. Hardly an edifying fan-base, is it? Jolie is a superb actress when portraying realistic and believable characters, but her tedious Laura Croft persona is trash.<br /><br />And just what is a female superhero? Nothing but a feminist's fantasy. This \\"I'm as tough as any man\\" mentality of the juvenile female mind is the real fiction-fantasy of female empowerment.<br /><br />Ok, Angelina, you showed us your balls in Tomb Raider. Do I really want to see Evelyn Salt's scrotum? Nope.
B005V5WBFG|5.0|I am so glad that McAfee had software for mobile devices<br /><br />I have McAfee on my laptop but did not know how to put it on my mobile device until I found  McAfee for mobile now I feel more safe when using my mobile device
B003SNKBXW|3.0|It was very interesting but a bit too literary intellectual for me with all the reference to other books. Good characters!
B0064NTZJO|5.0|This film in my opinion is becoming a cult classic.  I didn't know much about it going in, but I was pleasantly surprised by the character development and energy.  The transformation in this story is relatable to nearly anyone, only different context.  This movie gives you  just enough of everything to watch it over and over again, very enjoyable and one of my favorites.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|I love this game it is very much like slender but there is a glitch. in certain places u like fall out of the world into this white place and cant seem to get out. it happened to me 4 times and my cousin 2 times so please fix that.<br /><br />but other than that great game. I would defintaly give it 5 stars if u fix the glich. so please make a review if u experience the same things. thanks!
B002WN35DC|5.0|It was a great read, as noted by other reviewers the book didn't include the illustrations. I however, still enjoyed the book.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|As other reviewers have mentioned, this game is not free.  When I purchased the game, either I did not see that you would have to purchase it in the description or it has been recently added.  What they do not tell you is the game is five bucks.  Kind of steep for game on here, when you can purchase similar Big Fish games for half the price, like Enigmatis or Theater of the Absurd.<br />I did like the graphics and the story line, but I think the developer should be more upfront about the cost.  I see some of the Big Fish Games have free trials or a purchase for say, 3 dollars.  This way you know upfront how much the game will cost if you decide to purchase.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|I like it alot theres just one big problem about it. It runs my battery dead quicker because its like its always on in the backround. Apps kill the battery life quicker and i know that. But i read books all the time instead of playing games. I do like that it has the amout you have for each thing
B00846F1YW|3.0|Graphics were decent, but this is pretty much one hidden object scene after another with long, awkward dialogue by the characters in between.  And the story line was just weird.  Not weird good, but just weird.<br />This is personal preference, but I don't like the time limit on the hidden object scenes or how the game sometimes asks you to look for objects by their outline.
B00766CLPI|5.0|Streisand=The Greatest Voice. Some people might think this was a risky decision by Barbra until they hear these amazing classical songs by Barbra. She's truly a creative genius.
B005HP2JAM|5.0|Very interesting movie about the prehistoric painting in caves in the south of france. unique documentary of caves that are not open to the public with the oldest human drawing - pretty impressive
B00818J504|3.0|Despite its promise of being a behind the scenes account of the last few years of Ke$ha's life as told by the singer herself, it basically becomes a half hour read that sounds like a long winded press release for the new album.  There is very little bio information in the beginning, some accounts of life on tour, and it quickly turns into a &#34;making of warrior&#34; story.<br /><br />It's not a bad read overall, just not nearly as in depth as I would have hoped. I'm a fan of the singer and would like to know more about her life and where she came from.<br /><br />Kindle users beware: I purchased the kindle version to read on my iPad, only to find that with a book like this, the text is very small and you cannot zoom in.
B004LWZW6U|5.0|very bloody but very cool story and great effects ; the story is totally realistic, actors are not bad and some parts are funny - not recommended for young unless you want them to have bad dreams for weeks
B0026OR1UK|5.0|wow, what a great book. it explains not only how to get to be the best but also names some of the greatest coaches out there. i got my younger daughter set up with linda septien because of this book.
B007ZD17XO|4.0|This game is GRREAT!!!!!  I love the fast pace of it....Lee's you interested<br />and keeps you wondering what's gonna happen next...I'm glad I found it<br />.....TRY IT<br />.......you'll  love IT!!!!!!!!
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Morose glimpse into the maternal evolution of evil.  Not exactly an uplifting story - rushed ending - would have liked to see that developed more.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great Book. For a person like me that always guesses the ending of books and movies, this book had so many twists and turns. You love the characters and then you hate them. You are so involved in the story and then you get mad. I haven't read a great book like this in a long time. Different than other mysteries, written very well and very easy to follow. If you want a mystery that is page turner, a book that is going to make you say &#34;I Can't believe that just happened?!&#34; this is it.<br /><br />It is also about #crazylove of Nick and Amy, takes place in todays time #2012 which is nice.

B000VMFDW2|5.0|This is an outstanding and brutally honest accounting of one Marines' experience during the war in the Pacific. I could not put the book down. Among the best, if not the best, first hand account of any of the WWII books I have read.<br /><br />Loved it.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Got this as FAOTD. Usually I'm disappointed but this was one of the rare times Amazon gives us a good app for free instead of something that I can't believe they normally charge for.<br /><br />I was at first wary when I saw what type of game it was, requiring moving around to 'eat' smaller things while avoiding larger things, like the fish game. I was afraid touchscreen controls wouldn't be suited to it. this is different though and not so fast paced. the movements are subtle and the controls are excellent. I recommend this game.

B005KAH7QU|3.0|Cate Blanchett is the worst part of this movie. She's a very good actress, but her attempt at a Southern American accent was not even funny, it was nauseating. Even her double in the holding cell (Downton Abbey's Mary) can't do the accent at all & the result is laughable. The whole movie (minus the beginning) is entertaining, but there are many plot holes that leave you asking questions that should have been answered in the film. Its strongest aspect is the young protagonist, whose accent didn't bother me. As the movie appeared to have been filmed in multiple countries, the scenery was another of the film's assets.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|This is one of the better movies I have seen for the year. It was well put together and kept my intrest all the way though the movie. I'm not that into watching MMA or any other kind of fighting, but this movie made it cool.

The only thing is, i would of liked if the movie played in full screen instead of just widescreen but thats alright, i still am happy with my purchase and would recommend this site and seller to a friend. Thank you for my movie :o)

B007J4T2G8|1.0|What a silly book. Totally unbelievable and unrealistic.  Slow, boring and I feel like I was reading at a six grade level. Maybe I'm in just a too normal, fun and dedicated relationship to fully appreciate this book.  When I explained to my hubby that I really wanted to like the book, but found nothing to like, he said, maybe you're too mature.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|While this is no academy award winner, it answers a desperately needed call of something that provides both some quality social commentary and good natured good humor. Reminds me of a few other campy films but clearly stands alone in themes and storyline. While some big names may have done this as a tax write off, it's well worth the time - perhaps more than once.

0307744434|4.0|...and by record time I mean less than a month during the holiday season whilest having a toddler.<br /><br />I love magical realism of any kind, so this book was right up my alley. The period setting for this book and some of its tones made me think a touch of Mercedes Lackey work, just a touch.<br /><br />That said, I was intrigued by the young leads, though I can't say I felt much suspense or even romantic tension. It's definitely a tale that doesn't offer that much of a surprise ending, but still leaves the reader curious as how the story path progresses.<br /><br />All told, I'd have to say the story and the setting compelled me more than any of the individual characters (with the exception of Hector and the young tarot reader besieged by unrequited love...she at least offered a bit of a story twist in the end), but i did like how the author cast the book.<br /><br />Will be interested to see this visually in movie form :)
B001BKTEZA|5.0|I remember reading this book in highschool but I think I read the cliff notes. I never knew what I was missing. The book is excellent and very entertaining I felt I was living back in the thirties. GOOD! GOOD! GOOD!
0062014536|2.0|My Review:  (which could be a bit spoiler-y ~ you have been warned)<br /><br />I have so many problems with this book.  Okay, so I just finished it like twenty minutes ago and I'm reeling so please bear with me.  This may get harsh or ranty or I may just break down and cry...I don't even know.<br /><br />That right there is the crux of the problem. I do not know.<br /><br />Oliver has proven with the first two books in the series that she loves a big cliffhanger of an ending and I'm not opposed to those. Honestly, in a series of books a cliffhanger is what keeps you interested.  But this is the END. I want it all wrapped up in a pretty pretty package. Preferably with a big shiny bow.  And a name tag screaming TEAM ADAM WINS!<br /><br />Did I get that? Uh, no. What I received as a gift from Ms. Oliver was a whole lot of WTF? Oliver left so much open ended that I wanted to pull hair out. That is saying a lot...I don't have much hair to begin with and I'm quite fond of what I do have.<br /><br />I'm fairly sure I can see where she was trying to go with it and in some ways it is a quite beautiful statement. Mayhaps, I don't like beautiful profound statements to end my book obsessions.  Give me a little to fuel my imagination, sure ~ but give me enough closure as well.<br /><br />All right Ali ~ enough about the ending.<br /><br />The story. Requiem is told in dual POV, Lena and Hana both narrate.  I found Hana's first several chapters boring.  I almost wanted to skim them. Not good. Though I understand the need for them and about half way through the book I wasn't so annoyed with them.<br /><br />However, by that point I was getting more annoyed with Lena's chapters. There wasn't enough action or love.  Let's face it, these books are about love and freedom and the struggle to be able to chose both. Right? So where is all this love we are fighting for? It wasn't in Requiem.  Sure, there is some but it wasn't a fulfilling amount for me.  It was more depressing than anything.  Lena still loves Alex, Alex doesn't love Lena, Lena loves Julian, Julian loves Lena, Coral loves Alex, Alex loves Lena, Lena might love Alex; it was like a damn tennis match with too many players. But no one ever shows they love anyone else, it's all just random thought and speculation.  Okay, Julian does show it, props to Julian.<br /><br />And the lack of action I mentioned? Yeah, think Lord of The Rings...walk, talk a little, walk some more, eat, walking again. Bored now.<br /><br />I won't even get started on Dear Old Bee. Ircked me the heck out. I mean...what?  I don't want to give anything away for the folks who haven't read the series, so I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />I watched a video, just now, of Oliver defending her open ended ending.  She explains that she liked to leave it up to the imagination of the reader. Or some such thing.  I understand what she's saying, I do. I am all for tickling the imagination, but I am not a writer. Pretty sure I 'hired' her for that job when I bought the book.  It just feels like a cop out, to me.<br /><br />On the positive side, the writing is still beautiful, the idea is still beautiful.  Many fans of the series are going to love it just as much as the first two. I'm just not one of them...I'm one of those cranky old people that just didn't \\"get it\\".ng.  Lena still loves Alex, Alex doesn't love Lena, Lena loves Julian, Julian loves Lena, Coral loves Alex, Alex loves Lena, Lena might love Alex; it was like a damn tennis match with too many players.

1608955702|5.0|After following Neil van Niekerk's blog for years, I was excited to get his latest book.  It truly is the most comprehensive and well written treatise on light that I have read.  The chapters are arranged so that they build easily upon the next and the techniques are illustrated beautifully with van Niekerk's images.  His pull back images throughout the book serve both to illustrate and to inspire.  This is an invaluable tool for learning!

B001NZB5GO|5.0|I fell in love with every character.  Each had their own dynamic personality.  I tried to guess the ending several times, but was wrong each time.  A great movie stays in your mind for days afterward.  I woke the next morning seeing Greta Garbo flouncing around the room, waving her arms and dancing in the joy of falling in love.  Wonderful.  John Barrymore as the aristocrat thief who possessed a very compassionate heart toward his fellow man, Lionel Barrymore as the precious, terminally ill clerk who had is say with his care-less employer and made you cheer him for, Wallace Beery, who played his role well as the ruthless tycoon, and Joan Crawford with her many emotions trying to carve a place in the world for herself .  I have never seen Joan Crawford in her younger years - she has huge eyes and a very beautiful, soft face.  The background music was comprised of well, known European composers and  brought your fully into the time and place of this motion picture. This one is a keeper.

B006LSZECO|1.0|The book starts out slowly, with characters who are not very likeable, then picks up steam, then goes on and on and on before finally resolving, sort of.

B0035YDM4Y|4.0|I must admit first off to not really liking ghost-written memoirs, as I rarely feel the true personality of the person concerned comes through. In this respect, I feel Lone Survivor is guilty of not really allowing much more than a mish-mashed hybrid of Luttrell and Robinson to emerge for the reader to engage with.<br /><br />Having said that, though, I found the book a good and entertaining read. I can't say that I agree with Luttrell's politics and found some of his views a little at odds with mine, but then I'm writing from the perspective of a non-American and so this doesn't affect me. I have also read some of the criticisms of the depiction of the operation covered in the book, but found those to be relatively minor distractions. Luttrell was there and I wasn't and, whatever my own misgivings about some of his philosophies, he has more than earned the right to have them.<br /><br />The are better memoirs from Spec Ops operators out there, but the sheer drama of the contact Luttrell and his team found themselves in makes this a riveting read.

B003TSEL7S|5.0|Having massively enjoyed author Rick Riordan's previous two teen adventure series (Percy Jackson, Kane) I was naturally eager to start his third, the Heroes of Olympus). I am happy to report that, one book in, this series looks like it will live up to the standards of the previous two. As one could surmise from the title of the series this is a sequel to the Percy Jackson books.<br /><br />A lot of sequels are not so much sequels as rewrites of sorts and superficially many of the plot points of the Percy Jackson series are repeated here. There is a mysterious movement afoot to topple the Olympian gods from their positions of power, this time originating not with the Titans but one generation earlier, the earth goddess Gaea. Demigods are introduced and assembled to go on quests to thwart these plans. Mysterious prophecies foreshadow many plot points. Etc, etc, etc.<br /><br />But Riordan introduces enough new fresh concepts and characters to keep things interesting and engaging. A fair portion of the book is related in several flashbacks so the reader has an immediate sense that the plot is deep and is really going places and the action is not gratuitous but is setting and/or resolving plot points. The book really sucks you in.<br /><br />The new characters are interesting and for me at least really ingratiate themselves via their personalities, problems, back stories, and the like. Riordan uses a storytelling technique he perfected in the Kane books by shifting viewpoints among the three lead characters ensuring that each gets their needed development.<br /><br />Older characters are not neglected: Annabeth, Chiron, and Rachel Elizabeth Dare play key but decidedly supporting roles. The various gods and goddesses make cameos but the real treat is the modern takes on Medea, Midas, and Boreas, Khione, Aeolus, and various giants and cyclops.<br /><br />I read this book on the Kindle and everything is formatted perfectly. The only issue is that for some reason they decided not to enable tracking by print page number.<br /><br />Highly recommended. If you liked the Percy Jackson books, you'll like this one as well. And if you haven't read the Jackson books, read those first and come back to this one.ed not to enable tracking by print page number.<br /><br />Highly recommended. If you liked the Percy Jackson books, you'll like this one as well. And if you haven't read the Jackson books, read those first and come back to this one.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|I had heard the buzz about Sheryl Sandberg's Lead In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead that many of you may have heard as well. Written by an elitist with a double Harvard degree who was mentored by Larry Summers (gasp!) and is worth hundreds of millions in stock from Google and Facebook (oh no!), she couldn't possibly have anything to say to women in less fortunate positions. It was a vanity book designed to elevate Facebook (really?). I have to admit that it has been a long time since I remember a book being so roundly condemned by so many who hadn't even read it. The fact that a book authored by a woman about women was raising such a stink intrigued me. If I hadn't planned to read it before, I certainly looked forward to reading it now.<br /><br />I should be used to pundits being wrong.<br /><br />Honestly, there were some points in this book that almost had me wishing I were thirty years younger and still working. It takes a lot to do that. I am happy with my life (except for the grief part) and I don't generally envy the lot of today's working women.<br /><br />Lean In is not so much a feminist manifesto, as it is a hands-on guide to how a woman can think about and alter her chances for success. From the cultural inhibitions that women internalize to the social judgments levied on our performance, Sandberg presents possibilities for change. She addresses many of the same issues I tried to deal with in my career. And although I did okay, I know that some of the advice she offers would have made it possible for me to do a lot more. (Of course in those days she could not have attended Harvard. Or Yale. And COO of Facebook? Not likely.)<br /><br />Times have changed since Betty Friedan. Women can now attend Harvard. Women can become the COO of Facebook. But not enough of them do. And that is what Sandberg is trying to change with Lean In.<br /><br />Well researched and documented, Sandberg uses statistics, personal anecdotes, and stories from other successful women to present her case. She then uses some common sense, more research, and creative thinking to propose solutions.<br /><br />From the book:<br />\\"I am fully aware that most women are not focused on changing social norms for the next generation but simply trying to get through each day. Forty percent of employed mothers lack sick days and vacation leave, and about 50 percent of employed mothers are unable to take time off to care for a sick child. 21 Only about half of women receive any pay during maternity leave. 22 These policies can have severe consequences; families with no access to paid family leave often go into debt and can fall into poverty. 23 Part-time jobs with fluctuating schedules offer little chance to plan and often stop short of the forty-hour week that provides basic benefits. 24<br /><br />Too many work standards remain inflexible and unfair, often penalizing women with children. Too many talented women try their hardest to reach the top and bump up against systemic barriers. So many others pull back because they do not think they have a choice. All of this brings me back to Leymah Gbowee's insistence that we need more women in power. When leadership insists that these policies change, they will. Google put in pregnancy parking when I asked for it and it remains there long after I left. We must raise both the ceiling and the floor.\\"<br /><br />Yes, Sheryl Sandberg has had a storied career, leaving her worth close to a billion dollars, named as one of Forbes top five most powerful women in the world, but then, who would want to read a book by a failure? Who wants advice from someone who hasn't succeeded in making a difference?<br /><br />Maybe this is all just an evil plot to grow Facebook's audience and the value of her stock.  Or maybe it just is what she says it is. A way forward for women and their life partners. (She devotes an entire chapter to how important a life partner is to anyone's success in life.)<br /><br />Lean In doesn't have to have all of the answers in order to be pointing in the right direction. It is clear that the women's movement has stalled: on Friday North Dakota passed the most repressive anti-women laws the nation has ever seen, virtually denying women the rights guaranteed by Roe vs Wade, and we learned that NYPD officers have been ordered to run criminal record checks on the victims of domestic abuse. Clearly we need to do something. Until we have a greater share of power, our rights will continue to be dictated to us by others. It is time women started reaching for the levers of power in corporations, institutions and governments.<br /><br />Lean In doesn't stop with the last page. In addition to her TED talk, she has set up, of course, a Facebook page, and a website looking to continue the conversation. She envisions women meeting in small (8 to 12) Lean In Circles to learn from each other and support each other's growth. Small circles that have been disparagingly referred to as a throwback to the consciousness raising of times gone by. What her critics forget is that those consciousness raising parties did a lot of good back in the day.<br /><br />Jodi Kantor, of the New York Times, in an attempt to show how evil this plot is, published a copy of the document that is being circulated to potential corporate partners in the Lean In movement. (BTW, said corporate partners are only asked the use of their logos and endorsement, not funding, and their support for their employees who chose to join the circles.) I read the document, which I found here: [...]  And wish that when my girlfriends and I got together during the 70s in an informal support group at a nearby watering hole that we could have had access to the material and format of the new Lean In Circles. We got the job done, and helped other women move along their career paths, but not nearly enough and not quickly enough.<br /><br />All profits from her book go to LeanIn.org which is a non-profit public benefit corporation that runs the website of the same name.<br /><br />Lean In is not for all women. Nor is it meant to be. Not all women want a high powered career and a family. But for those who do, and for their partners, it is a book well worth reading.

B008FPOIT6|5.0|Loved this book, so different and  so positive. At first reminded me of Umberto Eco. A quick read worth doing! I would have to agree with the review that said that there was no major threat of bad things happening. I kind of kept waiting for something really bad to happen (ie in the chapter titled \\"The Tower\\") but everyone kept (fairly) cheerfully helping the main character. This is not really a downside for me because I read books for fun escapism and if they make you think all the better. This one was great. I would describe the book mainly as \\"Cheerful\\".

0307744434|4.0|I bought this book over a year ago. It has been sitting on my nightstand, unread, for the majority of that time. Oh, I tried to read it when I first got it. However, I must not have been in the right frame of mind, because I really didn't like it at first. I got through perhaps 50 pages, and put it away for what would be a year! Within that year, I almost gave it away. It was my last resort book, meaning that I would read it if I didn't have anything else to read. That day came, and I picked it up again recently...<br /><br />...And the second time around, it was one of the best books I've ever read. I couldn't remember why exactly I couldn't get into it the first time around. It is a very sci-fi type of book, with magic and other things that don't make sense. It does jump around from different time periods, which requires much focus on the part of the reader. I kept flipping back to chapters before, so I could get the years straight. Maybe there was too much going on in my life for things like that the first time around. But I loved every moment of it this time. The way to delve into this book is to not ask questions, and just accept the things that are happening, without needing further explanation. Perhaps that is a metaphor for our lives, as well. It's slow-moving, with no dynamic plot. I found there to be much character development and I enjoyed reading more about the different circus characters. It reaches out to the audience by bringing in a character who is a touch of \\"normal\\", in this enchanting world. It's not for everybody, but for those who it speaks to, it REALLY stays with you.
B001BKTEZA|4.0|I never read this in school.  What I was missing.  Each chapter is an elegant delight.  Not just the story but the story telling and wriitng work to perfection.
B00B99KJR0|2.0|This is a nice game...however, there is nothing to tell you how to clear those blocks in &quot;one &quot; box only and it makes it frustrating when you have a match in those areas and it doesn 't work!  I want a game I can play and relax...no timer, no frustration.
1594744475|5.0|This book is FULL of colorful pictures and instructions. We haven't even followed any of the creatures from the book yet but have used it as inspiration to make our own. This is the PERFECT book for someone just beginning in the art of Bento Boxes.<br />We have had nothing but fun since opening this book.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I have been a fan since 1978 when I first bought 2112 on vinyl.  I sort of lost interest after Moving Pictures with all the synths, but decided to buy tickets to their upcoming show in Baltimore.  I bought Clockwork Angels just to know the new stuff, not expecting much.  Well, I have to say, this is now my favorite Rush album.  Extremely heavy, this sounds like it could have been released between Permanent Waves and Moving Pictures, or even earlier!  Great arrangements, interesting lyrics, all around a powerhouse album.  If you are a Rush fan and are contemplating buying this, do it.  You will not be disappointed.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|The descriprion should save Kindle users the time it takes to download the app and set up their printer--and speicify that it does not work on their device!!!
B000W93CHC|3.0|I did not think that this book measured up to others that I have read from Ken Follett. It seemed to drag on & on repeating the same plot over & over. There were several times when I just wanted to leave it. . I kept reading because I already had invested so much time in it. flat at the end.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|If you're a fan of the bond series, this one should fulfill all of your wishes for a bond flick.  I love that it both completes the circle and starts off a new chapter for Bond.  I'm looking forward to the next movie, although sad that Mendes won't be on to direct again.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book! I cant wait to see the movie! I got this book on a recommendation from a friend.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This Series that Suzanne Collins wrote really was exciting to read. I also saw the movies. I was really glad that I had seen the movies, then I read the books as I got more out of it then.<br />Each book was a fast page turner. The author is a good story teller.

B00B99KJR0|5.0|Another great game from Playrix!  Love them all.  Great free app of the day!  Suberb match 3 game..,.  Thanks, great graphics.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I bought this so my grandkids would have something to play on my Kindle during a holiday road trip. Unfortunately I ended up playing it more than they did. Don't buy this game if you don't want to get sucked into the Angry Birds vortex...
1885167776|5.0|When I first started to read this I was excited but only had about 30 minutes. I thought I would start...and finish it later- then I found myself cancelling the rest of my day.... as I read this straight thru- I couldn't put it down!! That doesn't happen often for me!<br /><br />This is a book from a very smart real estate guy- AND it is about life- not real estate. I want my boys to hear this message. I want my family and friends to have the opportunity to understand this and I also want it to have a huge impact on the lives of those I truly care about. This is SO powerful!!
B00A72989U|4.0|There are a few songs that I care for but overall it is good. She is a great artist and I look forward to more albums.
B0002VFXFE|4.0|I bought this to use w/ a Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO cooling a i7-3770K.<br /><br />It was easy to get a pea sized amount out, and it seems to enable proper cooling of the CPU so far. I haven't done any sort of testing against the thermal grease that comes stock w/ the Cooler Master.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|When this movie came out at the theaters I was turned off by the &#34;strange&#34; appearance of the beloved Easter Bunny and Santa Claus.  My mistake missing this one on the big screen.  We recently rented it and we all fell in love with Jack Frost, the bad*ss Easter Bunny and especially with Baby Tooth.  Seriously, there's a reason this movie has so many 5-star reviews. Where was the buzz?  Not sure why this wasn't bigger at the theaters.  Maybe other people were turned off initially like I was.  Watch it.  You'll love it.  And remember, it's a PG movie, not G, so expect some excitement that might frighten a small child.  Mine are 10, 8 and two 7s.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Fantastic series.  Had to catch up with this series as I had not watched it on TV, but the feedbacks are great
B009E9QOEO|5.0|You know what? I do not come from the Led Zeppelin era, but it does not matter. I get my hands on whatever I can; CD, vinyl, DVDs...just to make darn well sure it seems like I grew up with their music from the beginning. This is an EXCELLENT album that rekindles the flame, both with the band and with the fans. You can tell there is a little age on fretboard, but what a way to feel like you were part of the reunion. I am not at all a fan of live albums, just not my thing, but this is a must have for Zep fans.
0470449748|4.0|Great practice problems. The problems are very similar to the actual problems in the GMAT and helped improve my score by 80 points.
B00B935SUY|5.0|A riveting look back at one of the most important recording studios of all time. This documentary plays more like a love letter to Sound City as a history of it. A great look back at the ups and downs and people behind this rock hit factory. My only problem is I feel like this could have been an amazing mini-series with and hour long episode for each decade. With so many incredible musicians and all of their stories it is impossible to not feel rushed in a single 1:45 film. A must watch for any rock music fan.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|super easy to use - just install and go.  Works great with my legacy network printer, no configuration necessary. Nice app.
0765322889|5.0|While I think this book is great and I would recommend it to a reader, I would not recommend the entire 10 book series. There are some real terrible books after the 4th in the series.<br /><br />But this is a great series, very much in the D&D meets Glenn Cook's the Black Company feel.<br /><br />Again this is a long series with some horrid follow-ups, but you will love the first four books, but then you will be stuck reading a terrible book horrid book 5 an ok book 6 a bad book 7 an ok book 8 and 9 and a decent book 10.<br /><br />Start at your own risk.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|FANTASTIC!!!!<br />I was on. The edge of my seat the entire time I read mockingjay!!! Fantastic final book to end an amazing series!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved this book, and the series! I can't even describe the emotion that these books can infuse... a must read series!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Some of the best match 3games to play. Fun and challenges for all. I love getting the power ups .<br />As you progress it is very challenging. Enjoy your game!!
B007REV4YI|5.0|I like all the Bond movies...that said my favorites are (#1) Sean Connery...and...(#2) Daniel Craig.......Craig movies seem more &#34;serious&#34; than the others...especially the Roger Moore ones which were more &#34;tongue in cheek&#34;..........I like Craig's version of Bond....tough, no nonsense, and take no prisoners....good story line as well.........so don't miss this one if you like James Bond because this one is pretty darned good........
B009IQG5LK|4.0|Dick Tracy might not have done as well as Batman did in the movie theatres, but it's a wonderful little movie with an all star cast that deserves a space in your collection. Based on the iconic comic strip character, the real stars of the film are the rogues gallery. The often grotesque and over the top villains never fail to capture the viewers attention. The bright comic like colors that absolutely pop in high definition 1080p, along with the Academy Award Winning make-up effects, is what most people remember about this film, but it is also a charming period piece that perfectly captures the 1930's era. The music provided by Stephen Sondheim and performed by Madonna adds to this neglected gem, it is a treat for the whole family and you'll be left wanting more.<br /><br />Technical aspects? The film is a beautiful transfer as is usual for a Disney film. However, the one glaring bad mark this release receives is the complete lack of special features. No commentary track, no trailers, no deleted scenes, no \\"making of\\" specials, no concept art, no character profiles, nothing. Disappointing for blu ray disc!<br /><br />Still, lack of special features aside, the movie itself and the beauty of the transfer is more than enough to recommend it to anyone who enjoys good movies.
B005V20JKI|5.0|This game is nothing but awesome. You think it will get boring but it never does. Also it is good to pass time. You should buy it, it won't be a let down.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie with Daniel Craig more than the other ones he starred. Maybe I finally accept him as James Bond. Always thought Craig was  good actor but had trouble seeing him as the Bond character til now. I still think of Connery as the best Bond.But this movie was pretty good
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|My spouse and I found the movie interesting and enjoyed it.  We did have some difficulty understanding the dialect though.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|My family and I loved it, particularly because my better half and I deeply appreciate the old school gaming references. Great movie all together, even if you aren't a gamer.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|No written review, just wanted to give a star rating.  No written review, just wanted to give a star rating
B003UESJF6|5.0|I bought it for my son for his birthday. He and his sister loved it. I watched it with them, and it was great.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|This video was such a pleasure to watch. Great music is the best answer to every day relaxation and just melts all your stress away.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The suspence its riveting!!! You just don't want to put the book down. Can't wait to start the next book.
1451695195|5.0|The way the story is told, keeps you wanting to read more. I am not an avid reader but I couldn't put this book down. Excellant choice.
B008476HBM|5.0|It is a novel about the interaction between different classes of people, of their pride and prejudice.  It's location is in England, but the same factions occur here in America.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is great to have in video library-to refresh story-line memory,to show friends who are new to series,and to watch when choices are lacking for viewing
B008N1V11U|3.0|Game is over all great but the game is slow and gets me aggrevated. i would give it 5 stars if only you fixed the spees so the game would clear up. Please fix b/c it is not worth 5 and im lucky to have gotten it with the deal for 3. I have a kindle hd 8'6 btw maybe thats why im so upset, the game woulda been great i love the game play and story line.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|This album/these guys are amazing. Most of the tracks are great at getting you pumped up, esp. Can't Hold Us and Make the Money (and Thrift Shop, obviously). Some of the tracks, like Same Love, Wing$, and Starting Over, are more about the issues in the lyrics than about giving you something to dance to; but these songs still have great beats & hooks, although generally they're slower in tempo.<br /><br />Macklemore has a gift for bringing you into his emotional journey. Every one of these tracks FEELS like the subject matter. E.g. Wing$ mixes nostalgia for your favorite childhood possessions, the pride you get from accomplishing something new when you're a kid, a strong desire to fit in/be the coolest, and coming into a consciousness of mortality; and Wing$ is (ostensibly) just a song about a pair of shoes. The lyrics are a huge part of this; but skilled producer Ryan Lewis also deserves major props for broadcasting these emotions straight into your ears and hearts.
B0095XPZBC|1.0|Here's the deal, I bought some tires and got a $70 rebate credit card. STNG had just come out in the re-released version. I lacked seasons 2 and 7. I already had seasons 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, in the first low quality dvd release. So, I sprung for either a new or a used bluray copy of STNG because the price was comparable to the NEWEST dvd re-release of the show.<br /><br />Disappointments:<br /><br />1)Yeah, BLURAYS are special but WHY put an EXPENSIVE and SPECIAL restoration project in a \\"DIMESTORE\\" bluray case? What does that packaging cost A DOLLAR? When I got the bluray season two the binder part had come UNCLIPPED from the back of the binder. I was afraid it was broken and that my discs were scratched. I got lucky and all I had to do was to clip the binder back into the case, but a clip from the front part of the case came busted off. The clip is what would hold any insert that might have come with the bluray set.<br /><br />2) There was SNOW in at least the FIRST EPISODE. What should have been a SOLID background, instead showed some sort of pixelation or DUSTY appearance, for a period of time. I was pretty UPSET because this was a STATE OF THE ART BLURAY RESTORATION. That being said the SNOW portion hasn't really show up again and I've watched about three episodes. But the SNOW effect is a BLURAY DEFECT. Somebody didn't do their job, not quality control and not some TECHNICAL person. I still can't F'ing believe it. The show effect sort of looked like the transporter effect when a person is broken down into atoms for transport.<br />******************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />The original release of STNG put the dvds in very durable boxes. Whoever was in charge of this bluray project was very disrespectful to the fans. You know, I'm not quite a GEEK who sits around watching Star Trek. I don't go to conventions. I'm not a DIE HARD FAN but the SUITS in charge of this re-release have been DISRESPECTFUL to the FANS of this show. I guess I should be happy the manufacturer didn't wrap the discs in plastic wrap and thrown them in a bubble envelope. You Mother *&^%%()+'s, why do you think people BUY BOOTLEG products? Why do you think people STEAL? Why should we RESPECT your INDUSTRY when you don't respect us?<br /><br />I spent about $45 on this product and I got a \\"FRAGILE\\" and \\"slightly damaged and flimsy case\\" which barely protects the blue ray discs. And the manufacturer didn't even get the first episode reproduced properly.<br /><br />In short, maybe you should buy a bootleg of this bluray project, or maybe the \\"newest\\" dvd release wasn't as half arsed as this.<br /><br />The POWERS THAT BE need to GET OVER the TINY is BETTER idea. Those TINY BLURAY cases are not made to hold FIVE or more discs. And you can't stack ANY weight on them because they are DELICATE. You MUST store the BLUERAYS STANDING UP.<br /><br />I REALLY HOPE this review gets somebody, somewhere into some trouble. Somebody needs to lose their job.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|My 2 year old found this very entertaining :) And he's hard to please. I wish it gave you a bit more time in between check points
B000H1RFKA|5.0|If the names Robert Downey, Jr., Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan don't immediately compel you to purchase this movie then I am not sure you deserve to have it.  If you need a flow chart, a diagram and a running commentary to clue you in to what is happening in a film then I KNOW this movie is not for you.  If you like intelligent humor, fast talking charismatic men and smart, sassy women then this film will be right up your alley.  They don't get any better than Robert Downey Jr and Val Kilmer and watching the two of them play off of each other is a joy to behold. I, for one, would watch Michelle Monaghan in any roll she chose to play.  The three of them together?  Heaven.
B00000D9TQ|1.0|The wrong CD was sent and was told that there was no replacement cd in stock. Love Phil Collins and was dissapointed.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Once I got this app I loved it since my friend has it on his computer. I decided to get it here,on my kindle fire.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Very addictive game, I just can't stop playing now, I highly recommend it. Nice and challenging against time, no regrets on this download, well done.
B001706I5I|1.0|The connection was horrible, the movie is great.. Very disappointed that I couldn't watch the entire movie without it messing up.
1926667131|5.0|All I can say is put down these modern day repeats. Haanel is one of the pioneers of metaphysical teaching. Not only are his lessons comprehensive but he offers practical application of his material at the end of each lesson. True growth comes with the application and Haanel takes out all the guesswork. The Master Key is a must read and should be apart of any library.
B000FC13UE|5.0|Resides both as a welcome and unwelcome guest. The man who gazes to long as you drink your coffee, yet you can't help wondering if he was staring at something unique within. A selfless book.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|so almost through this season and it keeps getting better. i highly recommend start season 1 today!!!! You won't be sorry
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is really cool I love horses! I have my own! you get to compete, feed, treat, and buy all different kinds of horses! thanks for making an amazing game:)
B003SI9WYG|5.0|One of my favorite movies! Love Tim Burton and love the type animation used in this movie. Definitely a must see
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|More of the same great show! Though I like season 2 a bit better, this one has lots of drama to keep you entertained and shocked! My only issue is that I didn't realize season 4 won't be shown in the states until January :(
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I got this book because of all the hype surrounding it. However, I was not able to get into the story line at all.
0547564651|5.0|When it comes down to it, as the author of Ecclesiastes stated, there is nothing new under the sun. Early parenting skills forms characters that guide and steer children through their life to success. Character has more impact on successful life than IQ. The disparity between the rich and the poor can be eradicated by well organized interventions of government policies, non profit organizations, and religious organizations. Academic achievement improves when children believe intelligence is malleable quality. Positive character changes are possible when you  present it as building good habits. Common sense that was exercised by our grandparents that faced adversity of radical intellectuals of 60's and 70's were neatly written down after evidence after evidence by the author in this interesting and helpful book. But after all, I realize that life and knowledge is rather simple. Hypothalamic-Pitutiary-Ardrenaline Axis performance, secure attachment, executive functions of prefrontal  areas of frontal lobe of our brain, character development, all these important things could be developed and enhanced if Americans valued their Protestant ethics. In my personal opinion, collapse of our society is rooted in collapse of ethics which started when American military and economic power were on top of this world and people thought that they could do very well without God. We made a bet against the Bible and God thinking our politicians and government workers will sufficiently secure our future with government polices and copious laws. Now we see overall collapse of economy, education, and innovation in our nation. Education is not the solution but I think the interventions that were suggested in this book would be very beneficial. Will apply  the specific examples in real life.
B009369Z8A|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! I suggest it to all my friends and family. The fact that it is based on a true story makes it even better. Western meets gangster!
B001FVD65O|3.0|Bruce Willis films are ok.  Action is great but after the last 2 or 3 films it seems the same plots over and over again.  But, again, the action is great.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Really Good as, would recommend if you enjoy building city games. Keeps you busy and is really good for fire kindle hd and is easy.
B0079R8KO0|4.0|Yes I like it - can't say I love it yet - new to Kindle just starting to get used to it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wouldn't have missed this season for the world!  Would gladly watch the series twice!  Can't wait for the next season!
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|We weren't sure what to expect before we watched it, but this movie rocks. Very colorful and fun for the kids, but it also has some depth and humor that adults will be sure to enjoy.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|If you are just browsing through her, Google this epic anime.  No words necessary for the entire film.  A true delight for any Daft Punk Fan.
B003QTWR08|5.0|One of my favorites from Pixar and the kids love it as well. It really looks great in HD !
1608955702|5.0|I am so impressed with this book! It's an easy read, clearly written and referenced and I feel refreshed and know I've learned something really valuable! A gem.<br /><br />Having been in many challenging lighting situations, the information in Neil's book gives you the insight to stop, look, and think about the direction and quality of light - which is key - and ask yourself \\"what\\" you can do with the tools you have to create a better portrait and furthermore ask yourself \\"why\\" are you doing what you are doing?. What a gift to be equipped with confidence and understanding in a situation that used to freak you out.<br /><br />I enjoyed every aspect covered in this book, the variety of scenarios, the photographs shown as examples, the explanation of techniques, the reasoning behind the scenes and then the application and final results. Neil's down to earth clarity, charm and wit carries with it a flow to enhance the flavor of this wonderful book.<br /><br />I believe that \\"The Direction & Quality of Light\\" can and will shape photographers to reach a higher level of professionalism and expertise by understanding and utilizing the variety of lighting techniques including natural, single and multiple off-camera lighting set-ups, and also by having a clearer understanding of exposure, camera functionality, and by simply experimenting with your own scenarios and referencing what the book says.<br /><br />It's a \\"must have\\" for any photographer who wants to learn to see and play with light. I believe this book can show you how to love light and make better portraits.<br /><br />I congratulate Neil on his desire to educate and enhance the world of photography with his vision to better understand how beautiful the art of photography is.<br /><br />Best,<br />Jas McDaniel
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I've loved the Bloos TD series since it started, and this keeps the tradition going. Lots of options, lots of strategy - but still fun enough for kids to enjoy and have a blast with.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love this app-I borrow library books and unless they were on Overdrive I could not read them on my phone-now I can!
B00992CF6W|5.0|BUT I REALLY HOPE FOR UPDATES MORE OFTEN,OTHERWISE IT IS THE BEST GAME<br />I EVER SET MY EYES ON.I ALSO WOULD ENJOY MORE BLOCK AND TO PLAY THE PC VERSION.THE PC EDITION CAN BE LOOKED UP ON YOUTUBE AND SOME OTHER WEB.I LOVE THIS GAME....
B00003CX95|3.0|Queen Isabella was not a sweet little woman!<br />She was known as the she wolf. She did sleep around with the guys.<br />King Edward was gay, Queen Isabella was a slut!  And this was in the early 1300's.
1574214276|5.0|I started Zentangling about a year ago. It has opened up my creativity, made me more focused, and I am a better listener.  This is a great book.  Zentangle is a great tool if you are ADD.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|We just got a smart tv and decided to watch one episode. After that one we had to see all of them in two days and now we are watching it every Sunday! It is absolutely addicting!
0486409511|5.0|This book is a must have for the new calligrapher. It shows the various letters, but also gives variations on some of the letters. It is an invaluable resource.  One final tip.  I took my book to a local Fed Ex/Kinko's and had a spiral binding placed on it.  That way I can open it up flat when I am working on my calligraphy and need to reference a letter. In fact I do that to all my craft/instructional books that I use a lot.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I will be buying this book in triplicate... One for each of the peeps I most desire to see succeed. So much more than a cookbook, this book teaches you how to do literally ANYTHING  better. I am a better person for having read it. And re-read it...
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Saw this in the theater and knew then that I wanted to own.  Off beat, funny, great music and Johnny Depp, what more can I say.  A treat for your senses.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|My husband who is the fussiest of movie viewers asked to see this again when we had rented it. We have since bought it off Amazon and i think we have watched it over 5 times. Great cast and higly entertaining! If you like vampire movies or Tim Burton this is a must see!
B0074VTHKM|5.0|This series is definitely one of the best series I have ever read!!! I love how things turn on the good guy!!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|if you dont get HBO (like me) then either instant view or buy the series. Amazing well done! If you like period pieces then this is a must see. Highly recommend. Although not for children as there is alot of adult content.
B004I744AS|5.0|Love this app . It's amazing and a must for vocabulary study ! The definitions are fully accurate and defines even the most complex of words ! 5 stars ! :) &nbsp;
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|The control part is a little difficult to maneuver! Therefore I can&quot;t really go higher than a 3 . It has potential just needs a tweak !
0452295548|5.0|I bought this book for my husband, who had suffered a similar stroke in 1996.  That, coincidentally, was the same year Dr. Taylor had her stroke.  After a long recovery and come-back, he found it very interesting that Dr. Taylor could put into words what a patient goes through.  As a trained brain scientist, she was able to breakdown, and bring clarity, to the events leading up to the stroke, and the subsequent effects and recovery process.  My husband got a lot out of this book, and would highly recommend it to anyone who has experienced a stroke, or anyone who has had to deal with someone who has had a stroke.  Excellent reading!
B00377E5SG|4.0|This is a movie we enjoy. It arrived quickly after being ordered and was in good shape. We were pleased with the purchase.
B005DNBDXM|3.0|This movie is a classic disaster movie with convenient plot twists that help the tragic heroes save the day, but it works.
B00942X8PY|5.0|Pleasant diversion.  Fun challenge,  Do Zen mode,  much better music for concentration.  Good visuals and flows smoothly.  Wish all graphics were this good.
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|Love this. This should be required viewing for every human being. Rodriguez is truly a living gift. Had to watch it two times in a row!
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I just got my new ForeRunner 405CX and I am in love with it. It has everything I need and is highly configurable.

B008HK3XU4|5.0|Love the case for my Kindle Fire. I love to sit in bed at night and play songpop and it props it right up. so nice
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Couldn't put it down. I saw the movie after reading the book. The book is so much better than the movie. Totally enjoyed it.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I loved the actress that played Emma (never seen her before) and I, as always, loved the actor who plays Mr. Knightly
1933952806|5.0|The book takes the manual and breaks down all the components in a way that is honestly needed for anyone who hasn't had a versitile dslr before. The book contains references to downloadable material that goes beyond operating and mastering the camera, but helps a fledgling in taking steps towards mastering the art itself. Very well rounded book and easy to follow.
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|I read the book... and if i hadn't, I'm not sure I'd have any idea what was going on in the movie.  I had to keep pausing it and explaining it to my husband because he was so lost.  Also, I wasn't crazy about how the movie was shot as though it was a play.  I thought that rather odd.  I would have preferred to have this movie shot in a way that reflected the serious nature of the content.  It just seemed too lighthearted and rushed at times.  All in all though... it was ok for what it was...
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|Its by far 1 of the better shows thats on television now<br />Some of the so called sci fi movies that ore on tv is worth the time it takes to watch them
B00005JKNF|5.0|My wife and I enjoyed this a lot. We are big fans of Downton Abbey, so I guess that gives us away as the kind of people who love to identify with the filthy rich, or at least fiercely snobbish.
B00BF2RTO2|4.0|This was from a time when at least you could see the guys of Maiden playing live. Because, since the last two decades, every Maiden live release is headache-inducing editing mess, where there is a cut each second (sometimes in even less time).<br /><br />The band is at peak form, songs are good, perfomance strong.<br /><br />Very good.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I would recommend this to everyone. I don't know how anyone couldn't love watching this nature documentary. Many hours of entertainment. Simply amazing.
B00846WWVM|5.0|I found this game mesmerizing, couldn't put it down!  Found it a fun diversion from watching TV.  A real challenge!
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|Starts promising, goes strong, ends poorly, as in fell of a cliff. Just on the cusp of worth reading. The Sportswriter is a lot better.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|What a surprisingly well-done film!  I was impressed by the overall feel of the film.  Yes, it's a vampire film, a horror film--but the acting was not entirely over the top melodramatic, and the atmosphere was perfect.  I thought Walker made a convincing Lincoln, and the supporting cast played their parts well.  I seem to have trouble convincing others that this is actually an enjoyable, pretty good movie.  So don't take my word for it--watch it yourself.  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
B00B2166BS|4.0|An OTG cable with a 32GB thumb drive means you can watch TV and movies while charging now.  Since OTG uses the only USB connection, can't do both and you know how long it takes to recharge a Nexus so this is great.  Build quality seems good, magnets click pretty well, could be a little stronger but this is the only one on the market at the time I wrote this.  No data, but charges quickly.  Another nice thing about POGO is that you don't have to worry about breaking or bending the USB connector any longer.  This should have come with the Nexus 10.  Well worth the $20 to me.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|While it took me awhile to get into the rhythm of the book,  once I did I couldn't put the book down.  I wanted to see how Cathy handled each new encounter she had.
B0030V0PEW|5.0|Atul Gawande delivers another great, informative read with The Checklist Manifesto. The stories are very well told and it is extremely informative. A must read
B009MF5BXK|3.0|Growing up with my brother in the 80's, we watched any action film we could get our hands on be it hand to hand combat or martial arts - we watched all the `bigger than life' characters who could never be defeated, names like Charles Bronson, Sho Kosugi, Bruce Lee, Sylvester Stallone, Kurt Russell, Steven Seagal, Rutger Hauer, Brandon Lee, Van Damme, and so on. Eventually, when we switched the television off and the glow on its face faded away, we asked the questions only boys would think of -  in a fight between Chuck Norris and Van Damme, who would win? Etc. etc. It was fun to think about the factors involved, the risks, strengths and weaknesses, etc. There were various films made to answer this question, say a fight between Snipes and Stallone in Demolition Man or Lundgren versus Van Damme in Universal Soldier. It was our version of watching two giant Japanese monsters duke it out on the streets of Japan, and it was awesome.<br /><br />It's been many years since I was a boy and when I first heard about the idea of The Expendables (a huge, colossal, mega-starred spectacle) my heart did somersaults! I couldn't fathom the concept yet hoped people (agents, studios, directors, film choreographers) could all put their egos aside and actually produce an epic balls out event fit for the giant screen! Was it a success? Yes and no.<br /><br />While the Expendable films will never match what a boy's imagination conjures up, it did well to become reality. That, in itself is worth gold, and while shootings, stabbings, beheadings, etc. aren't everyone's cup of tea, this movie represents a genre that most males connect with and will find some comfort in - there are certain rules you don't break like banging your best friend's girl or cheating a bud out of shared riches. The buddy theme is alive and well in this film and explores the concept of being part of something special; the fact that someone has your back no matter how difficult the odds are and will stand by you is something risking your life for. To quote Kenny Rogers - sometimes you gotta fight when you're a man. But to make this point clear, these guys aren't 'good guys' in the classic vein - When you deal with revenge, it's about standing up to the injustices of the world/bullies yet these mercenaries do have a conscience - it's hard to imagine them taking on a job they know would hurt their country, for instance.<br /><br />The filmmakers did a great job of crafting fight scenes that highlighted each person's skills such as Jet Li's scene - too bad he doesn't stick around for too much of the film. Some of the editing is a bit rough as we're not fully given the opportunity to absorb some of the heartwarming (to call them that) moments before we're thrust into another action sequence. Still, the overall product did not make it feel like different movies were spliced together willy nilly. If I have one caveat, it's the one-liners. I'm not opposed to them - think of action sequences as the long part of an exclamation point, and a one-liner as the dot! The one line that has been sorely over-used is Schwarzenegger's line from `The Terminator' - \\"I'll be back.\\" Some of the best lines (and moments) occur when the characters affirm they're not spring chickens anymore. I applaud them for poking fun at themselves, almost forgive the few crappy 1 liners.<br /><br />Bottom line: You should know the strength of a film like this is not going to be its story/screenplay, so if you can look past this fact and enjoy a plethora of action stunts/fights and macho attitude, you can't go wrong. I do recommend tightening the storyline for the next installment or these guys will expire before they've reached their new prime. Perhaps, they could give us a back story on how different characters met. Too bad David Carradine is 6 feet under. Damn!
B000FA5STS|5.0|Baldacci is superb! It is always a given that when you start reading one of his novels that you can't put it down until it's done.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|It's very nice to get old movies in the new formats and our grandkids absolutely love it.  Would recommend to anyone
B007C4ZJ0S|1.0|I dont recommend you  waste your time on this film. Itried to watch it to the end, but i couldnt. It had poor acting, easy to figure out what is going to happen, Just aweful...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Quite a fun and addictive game. Lots and lots of running, such good exercise! You kind of just want to keep playing it.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|relaxing and it's pretty cool. I got this when it was the free app of the day but after playing it I would pay for it.
B002ZG974M|5.0|I bought this for a friend who loves babies.  It is charming and will have you oooing and ahhing over the babies throughout.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Technology applied to the Bible makes searching for scriptures, keeping notes, and comparing the various versions of the Bible so simple and efficient.
1476733953|5.0|Wow, what a brilliant book. This has got to be one of the best PA/ Dystopian novels I've ever read and believe me I have read loads.... It's one of my favourite genres along with zombies.  5 Novellas seamlessly linked so easy to read. The world building is so richly detailed you can almost smell the stink of the oil and feel the vibrations of the machinery from the deeps. Really didn't want this to end, still not long to wait for the next book, really can't wait. If you love books in the PA/Dystopian genre, get this, you will never regret it. Can highly recommend it.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|A lot of action, suspense, and Denzel. Wanted to see more of the supporting characters' background regarding their relationships with the Captain/Pilot..
B009WO7NQO|4.0|okay its a good game but it cost a lot.<br />its like 6 dollars but if your a fan of angry birds this is the game for you
B0025YKDJC|5.0|I like the concept of the movie (it reminded me of Shallow Hal). - being bound by a commitment to change.  Yes Man featured comedy and romance which Jim Carrey is always successful in doing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger games will keep you in suspense  from book one And When you are finished with the series it will  leave you feeling empty inside. Making You want more,but the author does not provide it,leaving you thankful that the author has made more than one!!(: Best.Book.Series.Ever!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The story about surviving a totalitarian regime is woven with love and hope raising above destruction. A great story well told.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much!  I play it all the time!  once you get started you can't stop so it depends on your personality!
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Had me bawling by the end. True love at its finest. Shows what love is really about and what it means to love someone with everything you have :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I downloaded or for me on my kindle but my kids have taken it over. Its really that fun to play. I love it
B00005N6KG|3.0|I bought these head phones to use at the gym. I wanted something light but that won't fall out of my ears when I run. They are lightweight and the sound is good, but unfortunately, the cord is too short to reach the TV that's just in front of the treadmill. I then brought them to work to use in the office so that when I'm listening to something on my laptop, people around me don't have to hear it. Unfortunately, the cord is a bit short for that too. These would work if you're listening to your iPhone or iPod that's strapped to your arm or waist, but for my purposes they didn't work.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great game. It is also very addictive. I like it better than the first temple run game
B000RUAR5G|5.0|Yes. Yes you can. In this documentary you see the life and times of a true baller. The touching interaction between Elmer fudd and the green monstar was a beautiful moment in cinema. I don't care what anybody says space jam was robbed at the Grammy's that year. Now let me explain the glory of the quad city DJs. They are the best musical group since creed.
B000HSKUBE|4.0|This is a good series. I might have liked it more if I didn't see the new US version first. I think that this is a much lighter rendition and of course I had to take a crash course in British politics during the 90s.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was action filled and unpredictable and with every word u hung onto as if the very last words you will ever hear or read breath taking
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Fabulous book. Carter and Sadie were great characters in the book and the plot was always interesting. I would recommend this book.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|I can easily check my connections or job postings from the app. I can also access my messages and edit my profile right from my phone
B0086700CM|5.0|really great app, fun to spend time on it. it is very responsive and challenging, with great graphics and levels that increments difficulty
B0063GORYU|5.0|I just love playing spider. it beats the regular solitaire by a long shot. I play it several times a day. just lots of fun.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Super easy download. I don't have cable or satellite television so I was going to have to wait until this fall to see Season 3 on Netflix. Amazon is so much better than waiting. I also bought an episode from ITunes first but those aren't streamed. It took 2 hours and now takes up space on my hard drive. I love that Amazon streams the episodes! Great picture. I love it!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|i love this game but some ppl lag so u might get killed but if u do download this game look up me my name is anthworn
B001UTW7QU|5.0|The start of a great many years of remarkable shows. Cannot wait to see all the seasons shows. I started season 2 already.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This is an excellent story combining fantasy and fiction around reading and secrets. It is well written, the characters are well developed and believable,and the story line is very interesting. I can see readers wanting to create magic bookstores and secret books with secret codes. Someone should create a board game based on this book - it would be a hit! Great material for middle grades readers - with boys as the protagonists.
1589944607|5.0|This game has been nothing short of an addiction since its arrival. This game was clearly authored by a fan of the series, as every element of it--the abilities/traits of characters, viper combat, leadership choices, cylon espionage, and dealing with crises--refelects elements of the show. There are bluffing/deception elements reminiscent of poker. Every player's turn feels engaging to the other players since decisions often involve the entire group. Despite the complexity of the game, it is fairly simple to learn and become familiar with the turn structure. The two expansions make it even better.<br /><br />It is rare to find a game that so well draws from its source material, but Battlestar Galactica the Board Game captures a specatcular series in a fun, strategic board game. As I noted in the subject line, this game feels like a love letter to the show.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This is the second of these that I have bought. I had a pink one, and changed it out for black when my husband took over my Kindle. This is extremely easy to put on the device, has an excellent bank to hold the cover closed. and folds in the back to make a stand for viewing on a stable surface. It is an excellent product.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|FANTASTIC animation and a wonderful, meaningful story line! My kids LOVE to see ALL the mystical people come to life!
1451695195|5.0|Like Dr. Alexander says in his book, he was chosen because he was the perfect person to write or tell this story. Finally, science and belief/religion agree or come together in this well-written and easy to read story. I spends a good amount of time explaining why science says &#34;going to heaven and returning&#34; is not possible, then proves that it is possible and that he has done it. I also love that he has gone on to establish a foundation and web site for further investigation and support for others. Even if you don't believe, you should read this to see what everyone is talking about, then decide for yourself.
1402766785|5.0|After a thorough anatomical knowledge is gained, one can benefit from Bridgman's lessons in anatomy to simplify, rectify, and artistically express the figure in many difficult view points and poses. This will aid in solving many problems in figure drawing whether form imagination or life: along with \\"Fifty Figure Drawings\\" as a great visual aid. I recommend to get an earlier copy of the complete guide and get as close as possible to the year 1952 as the printing then was much better.<br /><br />Beginner's would do well to go through his smaller books first including \\"Life Drawing\\" and \\"Constructive Anatomy\\". I suggest you start with \\"Life Drawing\\" for an understanding of the figure as a whole, then \\"Constructive Anatomy\\" for the smaller details. Those two books would be easier to follow and be a kind of a shorthand workaround from the complete guide. You also should find vintage copies of those books and avoid the Dover publications for them specifically. I will still recommend the \\"Complete Guide\\" at one point or another as it has all of the smaller books within it and is more geared in preparing you for properly portraying the figure more \\"completely\\".
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The most obvious comment about this app is that it has the most beautiful graphics! My granddaughter loves horses and at 6 is already trail riding and caring for her own pony. Everything she has and loves is about horses, so I was glad to find this game app. She loves it! She gets to train, feed, and groom her horse onscreen. She gets to earn coins to buy accessories for her horse and stable, and she gets to take her horse to different kinds of competitions. She can choose what kind of horse to have, what kind of clothes her rider wears, and more. The only caution I have for the adults is that there are buttons on the screens where the player can purchase goods and extras for the game, so if a credit card is directly tied to the game, then children can automatically charge your card without you realizing. So turn off the automatic purchase before play begins.
B008JFUUIA|4.0|Great movie - ages 12 and up, great for a movie night with friends or on a road trip or if you are in a mood for a funny movie.
B003U0AHBO|3.0|Although it didn't recieve the best reviews, I thought this movie was very well done.  I find the time period it takes place in to be very intriguing as well as the dynamic between the English monarchy and the landed aristocracy.  I'm also a big Russel Crowe so If you like his acting (think Gladiator) then you will like movie as well.  However, I fully agree that the ending is ridiculous (not to ruin anything) and the movie seems to slow down at times.  The attempts to incorprate the more well-known stories about Robin Hood seem a bit ham-fisted and probably should have been reconsidered.  Overall I would reccomend this film but don't expect to be blown away.
B00A14SQBU|3.0|This feels like an album put together quickly with little thought. I'll probably continue to buy Christina's albums as long as she keeps putting them out, but it seems like she just pooped out after the amazing Back to Basics album. You could tell she was really focused then, and poured her heart into that album just like Stripped. This album has some good songs, but it's just not that great.
B005DOKM9M|3.0|This product has worked very well for me: I commute via subway to work every week and this allows me to carry around my Kindle Fire without worrying too much about damaging it.  However, don't expect it to protect a Kindle against more serious falls and wear and tear.  Also, it really is as described: a sleeve without any extra pockets for a charger or anything like that.  If that's what you're looking for then this item should be exactly what you need.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this game because it really challenges your brain to find the matches which frequently are hidden on another side of the cube....lots of fun for me and my brain at age 76!!
B008220DGE|5.0|A lot of people are saying \\"nothing happens\\" in The Master. For those who like film, please keep in mind these critics are the types that think Matt Damon is a good actor, and the Bourne films are what cinema should be. In short, The Master is not for them.<br /><br />Who is it for? People who like something that is a little more contemplative, requiring some thought and patience. Despite what low-end critics say, this film has a crystal clear narrative with a deliberate conclusion. That it doesn't satisfy the Bourne crowd doesn't mean those elements aren't there. They are.<br /><br />This story is about the relationship between two postwar men who find an affinity for each other, both fighting their animal nature while striving for a more spiritual existence. A Scientology-like organization called \\"The Cause\\" is the backdrop for this relationship, but this is not a film about Scientology nor L. Ron Hubbard. Anyone looking for such an expose is going to be disappointed. Scientology (or \\"The Cause\\") is merely the backdrop for the main story, not dissimilar to the Vietnam War being the backdrop for the main story in Apocalypse Now.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing throughout, a truly brave performance. Hoffman backs him up nicely, and Amy Adams is solid throughout despite having a more minor role.<br /><br />The music is great and the photography is gorgeous. There's no fancy shots, no slick editing, no huge set piece. Just a great story, well-acted and patiently directed. I would have given 4 1/2 stars as it falls just short of being a masterpiece, but I rounded it up to 5 stars since many people and critics have unfairly maligned this great film.
B004RC8NUQ|5.0|Portman is smoking, and a bit like the gal next door.  I really liked the story and the actors throughout.
1439148953|5.0|This book is quite simply one the most beautifully written books I have ever had the pleasure to read.  I am drawn to page turners and often need to remind myself to slow down to avoid racing from plot point to plot point.  I wasn't even past the second chapter before I didn't need to be reminded to slow down.  I wanted to savor every word of Toibin's exquisite prose.  I read many books, and all too many of them are quickly forgotten.  Brooklyn is not one of those books.  It is beautiful and devastating in the same breath.  I cried when I read the last page, both because of the story and that I had come to the end of one of the best books I had read in many many years.  Novels like this do not come around often, and they need to be savored.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Really enjoyed this book, I didnt read it as fast as some others but I was able to pick right back up with ease. Read the last 30% in one sitting becuase I could not put it down!! I dont usually read a lot of Nicholas Sparks but this one had a little mystery too which I enjoyed a lot.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|Not bad for a first novel, but it needs refinement to make it better, a good editor would smooth out the bumps.  Inconsistencies with the storyline, believability, misuse of words, etc all need to be fixed.  I would not want to eat foul...fowl?  Really?  And going off on a joyride with his knight and not telling him about the possible assassination attempt on the king? And the whole book making us believe, as does the king and everyone else at court, that the king's son is a sneaky weasel, yet when the hero knocks the cup of poison from the king's hand, the son is believed when he accuses the hero? Especially when the hero had already made one attempt to warn the king?  Oh, come on. If he poisoned the king's wine why would he knock it out of his hands?  Shower the guy with honors like the falcon one day then throw him in the dungeon the next?  More time could have been spent on fleshing out the characters and relationships. Re read your own work and you will catch a lot of this stuff.  That said, I read this book through to the end, because I felt it had promise and the storyline held my interest.  If the author takes the time to polish up the next installment and try not to strain the boundaries of believability too much (ok, Princess, how could you believe your wanna-be fiancé over a Hero? And all that screaming? Where's that bred and picked to be Queen demeanor?  And having the poor baby (rare, white) panther killing the (rare, white) snake, and, by the way, why are you never feeding that poor kitty, or letting it sleep?  And if the snake is so rare and an omen, why not tell anyone about seeing and killing it?  Sorry if I spoiled anything for future readers, but this is elementary stuff that drives me crazy!  This was an ok start on what could be a fun journey, though, so find an editor to help you!  I totally disagree with whoever placed this book in the same league as Game of Thrones...not even close.  It has promise, but needs polish, in my humble opinion.
B005LTDPJI|5.0|I've thought about ELO over the years thinking the music hasn't stood the test of time, well i was wrong i just recently received this box set and on the first day i listened to the first five albums what a great band and what a great songwriter Jeff Lynne is. The cd's have been remastered and have bonus tracks.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Admittedly a bit soap-opera-y at times, but the acting, writing, and filming are top notch.  An engrossing glimpse into a bygone era which does not romanticize its traditional values, but also does not judge them.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I enjoyed this game challenging in its own way. Fun with the story behind the searching. Good for adults and teens. Makes you think and think.
B0095P29EG|1.0|Gawd, what a pathetic piece of CGI drudgery. Great I suppose if you all you care about is computer-generated bells and whistles, but if anything else - plot, acting, character development, all that last-century stuff - matters, you won't find any of that here.
B004LZEV4Q|5.0|this is a very great deal what an awesome product would definitely buy again so great to be able to have it shipped to me
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Big buttons and screen are great for old eyes. Very useful history panel that operates like a tape. Has everything i need.
159514188X|4.0|Purchased this book for my son at the request of our school district. The tenth graders were required to read this book as a summer project. My son loved the book.  Thought it was a easy reader as well as informative to all readers. This is a book all teenagers should read.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I love the G5 hidden object games. The graphics are outstanding and the storyline is great. I am not fond of monster type games but enjoy the searching aspect. Very worth the time! The last G5 hidden object game I downloaded, I ended up purchasing! It was well worth it!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|It was interesting how the entire story was in interview form, and it really keeps you interested. Plenty of scenarios, plenty of types of people. Great book
B0095P3ULC|3.0|Looks and feels pretty much the same as the first two. Plot device using the moon landing is clever. Once again, pairs LeBarf with a girl he could never get.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Good read, especially for us older  folks that still remember where we were when it happened.  All you can expect.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is an amazing saga!  I get so into this that I don't know what's going on around me!!!  It is so well acted and the scenery is truly beautiful.  The characters are so fun to watch because they all have their own agenda and act it out so well.  I can't wait for Season 4!!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|As usual Stephen King books do not disappoint.  I got the book as the Midwest was headed for a snowstorm and knew I would be housebound for a few days.  It was great entertainment when we lost our cable/internet during the storm  I always love how he gets you so involved in the characters.  I was hoping for a different ending but that onl happens in fairytales :(
B0000028M8|5.0|Came in average time. Good quality. Easy to deal with and the description was spot on for the tape. Good overall.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Come follow me!  I love all things to do with home decorating.  It has provided me with lot's of great ideas for my home.
B000003TAC|5.0|The case was broken but the tape was mint. Came in average time. Good quality. Easy to deal with and the description was spot on for the tape. I can overlook the case issue.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|I was able to generate plenty of ideas related to my own business as I read through the book. Entertaining, easy to read, and helpful.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Great show but wish there were more screen size selections. I have a great computer that runs the best qualities but more screen sizes would make instant video that much better.
B009VB97EY|3.0|After waiting months to view this movie I thought it was just okay.  There was so much hype when it came out due to it being marketed to a female audience.  So, by the time I rented it, it was just an okay movie.  In fact, I thought it would of been more about the male dancing, but the story line about the character-Magic Mike was more the fact.  So, although I might of expected it to be more titillating it was an okay movie.
B00BNPZAEM|5.0|It's great to have David back, and I missed his beautiful and meaningful music ten years is to long to be without new music from David. The album is a collection of great works, and almost seems what is say ( The Next Day) he picked up right where Hero's left off, Love it Love it Love it!!!!!!!!!
B001NLKT60|5.0|I was attracted to this series after the first movie..This one won't disappoint!!! I'm buying the third one right now.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because ever month or so the theme changes and it works great on the kindle fire.
6305692572|5.0|I really really loved this movie! It was a heartwarming depiction of how much a husband loves his wife and wants to help her, but she is deep in her addiction, and she is the only one who can help herself. This also shows how it affects the whole family. One of my all-time favorites!
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|There is a lagging glitches in the game on the kindle fire. If you leave the app open, and sleep the device, when you come back to play, it either slows down for a while, then goes extreamly fast. The screen also is very full of glitches. It does this sometimes even when you first open the app.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|Awesome, Can't wait for the next part to tie it all into together. I am an great Fan. My kids liked it too.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|why do we have to have such awful language?  I really think it is unnecessary.  and five more words required
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We love the series. It does not have the sex that all the shows today have.  The story is well written and acted.  Good wholesome entertainment. Love it!!!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I enjoy this game, but it is hard to put down,  and after a while my thumb will begin to hurt but get it. Its worth it.
B001BKVWYG|4.0|Fun tunes with deep insight.<br />Kinda haunting. (Sugar Man)<br />Buy it, I hope Rodriguez is getting a fair cut from these!  He waited too long!
B005ES0XVO|5.0|I purchased them for my husband.  He said they are his new favorite shoe.  Believe me that is saying a lot coming from him.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Whoever put the game up did a good job!I love this game!Now can you do a free farm village?Once again good job with the game.
B008476HBM|5.0|I've loved this book, and other Austen books, for years. This is definitely worth having on your kindle! 5 stars!
B009EANE3M|5.0|I was iffy about buying it just because I wasn't sure if I wanted to spend the money but then amazon made it only a couple dollars so I purchased it and I'm glad I did. I love The Script.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was a good book and I was surprised with a twist at the end. I would recommend it for romance readers like myself.
B0071FBARY|5.0|I was iffy about buying it just because I wasn't sure if I wanted to spend the money but then amazon made it only a couple dollars so I purchased it and I'm glad I did. I love The Fray.
B001EBV0OY|4.0|One of my favorites and this one was a gift so a family member can enjoy the great story also
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Buena informacion acerca de las precauciones que se deben tomar para crear y plublucar unlibro en kindle, sobre todo para aquellos con amplia experiencia creando documentos en microsoft word, pues advieete de los errores mas comunesque se cometen.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Would recommend to anyone.  Parts of it were even funny considering the real subject of the movie.  Even better if you do not remember the details of the time.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great game to pick up and play anytime. Share with grandkids. Taking turns is the hard part.  We play a couple times a day.
0740745271|5.0|I BOUGHT AND I HAVE YET TO READ OR STUDY YET.  I AM DISABLED AND I'M TRYING TO MANY THINGS AT ONCE!!!! BUT I WILL READ AND HOPEFULLY I WILL FOLLOW DIRECTIONS AND LEARN SOMETHING!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have just started to read the Bible and what I love is that it is reading to me. You can play the voice and read along or just listen.<br />I need to figure out how to navigate to the different books, but it has me reading throughout the day. I choose to read the Bible instead of watching the TV.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The Bible is unique specially when hearing the audio version , it is very clear and read with out mentioning the verse numbers that the Amazon Kindle fire's audio does.(mentions the vers numbers, which is not needed.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|See, you don't need zombies tearing people's heads off, or tons of sex and all that other garbage to have a great horror film. This is still one of my favorites and you don't even see the shark for the first time till what, 50 mins in? &#34;You're gonna need a bigger boat&#34;..classic line.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|My kids (5 and 4) love this movie and even better, my husband and I love this movie. It's not a hardship to watch like so many other kids movies. As an added bonus, the hopping eggs are very cute - they may not last long but they are cute!
B00BESLHEA|2.0|I was excited to see this, but it was not everything I had expected.  There are some cool action scenes, but that is all.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Excellent way to read pdf files and documents. I would definitely recommend. I really love it because I'm able to read my book Think and Grow Rich! Future multi millionaire!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This is a great Disney movie like most Disney movies!  Kids and adults will enjoy the story and humor in this movie.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Interesting game. Be warned, it takes patience to win, though. Very nice graphics, music is okay. Would recommend this game.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|This was a solid movie like most other Bond movies.  You do not have to be a Bond fan to enjoy this.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|I was drawn into this show right from the start but it really isn't for me in the long run.  The actors are quite good together really.
B007HU7NBK|4.0|Definately worth the buy if you're into rock biographies. It really keeps your attention and flows very smoothly. Interesting learning about that era (early to mid 80's).
B004AUNSX2|4.0|I hadn't heard of the real story tied to this movie before watching - it is a good story and it really surprised me.  Love the actors, good story line (slow a bit at times) but in the end I found I loved watching it.  Recommend
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|I enjoy this CD we got from Amazon.  I can honestly say however, that I am not so wild about all the songs but I don't feel that is unusual with any CD.  I am glad I purchased it.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|got this for my kids for an Easter gift. They love the perplexus, so I'm sure this will be a hit too. What a challenging toy. Uses problem solving as well as planning skills, good educational, coordination toy. My 11 year old boys love it.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|We watched this on PBS and I loved the songs.  This CD from Amazon gave me all the songs without all the commercials.  I love listening to Andrea Bocelli.
1594203334|1.0|I would give this book 0 stars if I could.<br /><br />While at work this afternoon, a copy of 'Bringing Up Bebe: One American Mother Discovers the Wisdom of French Parenting.' I took a look inside and immediately put it down. If wisdom is undermining breastfeeding, then I would prefer to remain ignorant. French \\"wisdom\\" completely undermines breastfeeding.<br /><br />If you want a book that teaches you how to fail at breastfeeding, then, by all means, read this book. Otherwise, don't even pick this book up.<br /><br />Despite the French \\"wisdom,\\" young babies should not sleep through the night. Breastfed babies, in particular, do not sleep through the night until much older. French mothers also usually quit breastfeeding by 3 months. The World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding until 6 months followed by continued breastfeeding until 1 and then breastfeeding for 2 years or beyond as mutually desired by mother and baby.<br /><br />I give this book 0 stars and 2 thumbs down.
B002TVQ4GW|5.0|Brilliance sneaks up on you during what seems like another dumb horror film (from the box cover at least).  You will like this if you like a good horror flick.
B008J05EL8|3.0|Needed this app to go with the Office Suite Pro package. Had a hard time installing the package and am still not sure that I can use it.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Game moves well. The instructions were good. Sounds were average.games relieve stress. They are a distraction and they are a challenge for the mind.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|I downloaded this package so I didn't have to deal with the default app on my Kindle. Hardly use it, but it is there if I need it.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|This is the best Castle yet. The interaction of the characters is superbly written. The actors were well cast and do a superb job relating the depth of their characters.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Pop the pocorn and get ready for a great movie with the family! this is one of our favorites! You will almost cry, and you will laugh a lot!
B00004R99J|5.0|My 4 year old granddaughter really wanted this dvd. She watches it over and over . this was in really good condition when we got it.
B004EK926K|5.0|Amazing how these characters are all played by Jim Carey. This is a phenomonal movie that will be on our watch list for every Christmas.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|OMG This app ROCKS I am loving it boost are super fun and so is the egg hunt !!!!!! I hope you enjoy just like I do!!!!;-)
B005MVJM3I|5.0|Every track on this disc is amazing. The title track is one of their best ever, incorporating a clean arpeggiated  intro that sets the mood into a crushing track. Be still and Know is another amazing track, as is darkness within. And we cant forget the opening track I am Hell which sets the mood for the entire disc.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I really enjoy this book and I hope you can read it lots of time it's<br /> a great book for the kindle fire 7 so enjoy
B004I744AS|5.0|The reason I like this app better than the pther ones is because even if you type in like a Yiddish word or Hebrews word or something like that, it still gives you the definition.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I like the author and it was a good book but not 5 star quality.  Yes, I would recommend the book for light, entertaining reading.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I had this movie and recently just purchased it again. My grandson fell in love with this movie. He watches this movie just about every day. I always get my packages packed and shipped really nice. this movie in a box from Amazon wont move it will stay right where they put it until I receive it.
B002APU580|5.0|I love this movie! Donald Sutherland portrays Mr. Bennet beautifully. I could watch it over and over again.  I confess as the mother of three girls I can relate to Mrs. Bennet, but I wouldn't send my daughter out in the rain in hopes of snagging a man.
B0060FXBNM|3.0|I enjoy this series, but when it came, the case was broken. It was chipped on the bottom, but luckily none of the blu-ray movies were damaged.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is very good but has some interesting transitions witch confused me a little bot but I under stood them at the end otherwise I think everybody should read the book.
B008WOULPK|5.0|sometimes I got characters confused and had to back track and I wondered abut her current relationship with her boyfriend because there wasn't much said, but otherwise I quite enjoyed the book.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This book is great for anyone who loves fiction stories! I thought the first book took me into another world but this series is just getting started and I'm on the third book now!
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|I love this book. I tried to read it once before but didn't finish. I'm glad that I picked it up again. This book is engaging and filled with so many twist. The protagonist Emma really makes the book. There were so many incidents where I disliked her, loved her- got angry and irritated. This character was real and so relatable. She was flawed and oh so human. It is great to read about  her growth and maturation. Jane Austen does it again. I'm sad to be finished with \\"Emma\\"
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Good game takes up free time when there's nothing else to do.... plays awesome on my kindle fire hd and is very challenging at times.
0321146530|5.0|The writer have really strong knowledge about what he write and from what I have read. It made me realized that this book write from normal human being to normal human being like us.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book, I could tell, was going to be sad. Its two leads, Hazel and Augustus, meet in a cancer support group where the unnecessary suffering and mortality of sick children is always the main topic. But this is a love story. Because love is always fleeting, only as infinite and forever as lives are, as the world is, as the universe is. Green's book is about that, about grasping what we can while we can - even in a place where everything ends - because love is beautiful, powerful and because it occasionally asserts itself even when it would be better not to have heartbreak and disappointment. Gus and Hazel - wonderful characters - learn that. I was grateful to read this and be reminded. Highly recommended.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Of course it is fantastic. Season 2 is still my favorite. There is one episode I didnt buy because I watched it on TV and thankful because I think I am scarred for life and do not want to watch THAT again, EVER.<br />I love Dame Maggie and will continue to buy the series until she decides not to wear a lavender hat and make crazy eyes at everyone.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This is one of the revelations of the new era of publishing, a genuinely talented writer delivering a great story for minimal cost to the reader. Howey's imagination and high quality prose drew me in from the very start and kept me intrigued at least until about halfway. I had no trouble at all finishing the book and rate it highly overall but did find the second half less compelling. In particular, I was not convinced by the romantic interest for the heroine Juliette. She is depicted as a very appealing combination of say Sigourney Weaver's Ripley in the Alien movies and someone more glamorous, perhaps Angelina Jolie. I couldn't see her falling for the timorous IT deputy. There were also sequences in the latter stages which would be quite cinematic but were rather long and hard to visualize as a reader. But overall this is a gripping tale, deservedly popular.
0525953728|5.0|I did not purchase this book from Amazon, it was a loaner from my mom.<br /><br />The first several pages took me a while to get through, there was a lot for me to process.  While I may have at some level known that there were differing levels of skill in the Seals, I did not connect the dots with regards to who got on Seal Team 6.  That process was very interesting to me.  Knowing I only had a 1-2 hour interview for my job, and these guys had (if I recall correctly) a 9 month \\"interview\\" is quite an impressive feat.<br /><br />Once I managed to wrap my mind around what composes this team and started to align what I had heard / read in the news with the book it became much easier for me to read.  Once I got started, I read the entire book in less than a weekend.<br /><br />I've seen this book in Wal-Mart and on book shelves everywhere I go.  But to be honest, just glancing over the cover and what was printed on the back didn't really do anything to interest me in reading this book.  However, I am very grateful that I was mistaken and gave the book a chance.  Definitely a worth while read.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I truly enjoyed this set of films. The picture was much clearer than with the DVD. You could actually see the dark scenes. Thank you.
B00AZM7IQC|3.0|This is a replica of the MGM Grand show Ka. The beginning is a little different, but if you saw Ka then you will recognize the acts, stage and characters in this. For this reason, its 3 stars at best.... I would recommend Journey of Man if you want to see a 3D Cirque film- that one is a 5 Star film!!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Truly enjoyed watching this film. The colors are so clear--it's like being there. The creators of this film are amazing people.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Meryl Streep is so good... Tommy Lee Jones is okay. We never really understand what his issue is, but watching Meryl Streep is worth it alone.
B008I3RARW|1.0|Could not get the game to work  No way to control the racecar, it was stuck in reverse.  The paddles that control direcrion and braking were not displayed.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|My headline summed it up. I love Denzel Washington, but I didn't care for this film. Would rather watch an oldie than this one again.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Argo is a well crafted example of old-fashioned story telling.  Even though the ultimate outcome is well known there is enough intrigue and suspense to keep you engrossed in the plot and characters -- you feel a part of the intricacies of planning and executing the operation.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Very fun game for the entire family.  My husband has beat all the games, but do not be fooled.  Some are very challenging but they can be beat.  And for the price, you won 't be disappointed.  The kids need some helping some, bit we all love ot.  :)
B00005JLKN|5.0|Anthony Hopkins is just wonderful in any movie that I have seen of his.  This was no exception and will watch it again.
B009MO5ES8|5.0|I'm a fan of JG-L so I'm not very good at rating this.  Blah, Blah, Blah Blah, Blah<br />why do you need so many words?
1451627297|5.0|King said that he started this book in 1972 but put it away because at the time he was still teaching full time, and the Kennedy assassination was still too raw. I'm glad he did. For one thing, the gap in time is just enough to add some beautifully nostalgic moments and if he'd written it in 72 he wouldn't have known about the internet and cell phones.<br /><br />The other thing that probably added to the descriptive power was the beating the protagonist takes, which I am sure has a lot to do with the vehicle accident that almost took King's life some years ago.<br /><br />All in all, this is a really good book, whether you believe the one man story or favour the conspiracy, the story rolls along with the power of a freight train.<br /><br />I don't know how he does it, but the final stage of the book leading up to the assassination is tremendous and I found myself virtually speed reading just so I could find out what was going to happen.<br /><br />Way to go Steve!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007XCHQRI Pictures of Angels]]
B000YMM3CC|5.0|A true classic. Great actors and performances. A love story turned into a beautiful drama, avoiding typical &#34;repetitions&#34;.I highly recommend it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|One of the best series I have seen in a long time. Acting, plot, everything is first rate. Don't miss it!
1423124960|3.0|the one i received was in rough condition, with food all over it, worn-out, and also the part of the cover was coming off. the seller should have been honest about the condition.

B001THZAAI|3.0|Decent story, decent acting...But the subbing kind of degrade the humor. Really need to understand French to understand fully the humor in the dialogue
B009HEMW4W|5.0|I loved every minute of this film and give it 5 stars. I highly recommend this movie to everyone! I have the complete collection and have never been disappointed!<br /><br />Visit The Mega Shop USA online.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Good family film. Funny. Might make you softies cry. Definitely a great film to sit down and watch with your family.
B000N7KTBU|5.0|Great price and it does exactly what I need. I got this to encase an old hard drive couldn't be happier.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|Ridiculous. I always bump on that wall on the rail. I could never go up over the fence or wall by the rail. Not even fun to play when you never have a chance to win the game...
B004GCQ2WS|4.0|Not a bad used album skips a few times on the most popular song. Not bad for workout music at home or a gym.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I loved it!!! I want to buy it for my grandbaby. It had a great story some people may have a glitch but you can do and be anything  you wont in life.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Nothing to complain about this product, from packaging to delivery was great. Looks very new when I got from the mail/box. Very good quality when watched. Would recommend for Star Wars fans. Enjoy watching!
B0036BK6MW|4.0|ITS AN ALL AROUND GOOD MOVIE.WE NEED MORE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD LIKE SANDRA BULLICKS PART IN THE MOVIE .THERES SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE THAT DONT HAVE FAMILY AND THEY DESERVE A GOOD CHANCE IN LIFE
0984183523|2.0|After looking at rave reviews both online and offline, I ordered the book.<br /><br />However, even after reading through the book I do not feel that I've learned anything more than what Case in Point offered me.<br /><br />The book is riddled with typos, generalizations, self-appraisals and strange frameworks such as the hypothesis testing. Speaking as a scientist, you cannot hope to have a hypothesis before you know where in the broad subject of science you are, but Victor Cheng's hypothesis modeling seems to do exactly that. It seems useless, and the CiP's approach of &#34;restating the objective&#34; and &#34;asking for any hidden ones&#34; is better served.<br /><br />If you're reading this, save yourself some trouble and get CiP, or read it once again. A &#34;Bible of the Case Interview&#34; is a bible for a reason, and also the reason why nobody's ever heard of this egotistical book.
B004RL9T50|5.0|I loved it.It has good music in it.ACDC is one of favorite bands when I was a teenager.My grandbaby loved it
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Powerful series. I think the cast, and crew are doing a great job bringing this project to life. I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of it.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|I love it .I bought it for my grandson.its an all around great movie.I would recommend it to any one who loves animations
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is great it asks you to pay 2.99 half way through but I think its worth it. I cant put it down! I will tell friends and tam about this game its a great way to pass the time but be carefully you wont be able to put it down trust me.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I love Sons of Anarchy, was very happy that I could instantly watch episodes that I missed during the regular showing.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Ever since I got it, I've never had any doubts about keeping it. By far the best keyboard app for android. Love the new integrated Flow functions.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|Awesome movie, Alex was hot as usually .its a good movie to watch with the family and surround sound .
B005AKFXZW|4.0|I really enjoyed this even though it jumps back and forth it flows nicely. I wish I could visit this circus
B009YP9L7U|2.0|I tried reading this book two different times and for some reason I just could not get interested in it.  For me just to much nothing at the first so I quit reading it.
B001AT4Y84|4.0|This sequel was extremely funny. I was a little disappointed to find out the &#34;end&#34; was not really &#34;the end&#34; like they made you think in T2 but overall it was good. Out of the first three movies, this one has no sexual content except a lot of bad words which made it easy to watch with a 14 yr old. We laughed from beginning to end. I still recommend it just because its a &#34;Governator&#34; movie. He rocks...still! :0)
1603420398|5.0|I crochet for cancer patients and am always looking for a new pattern. These Mofits give me an endless supply of new patterns.  Also the book is beautiful and easy to follow.
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|No problems encountered with order. Was able to catch up on episodes that I had missed during the regular season.
B009VB9VKY|5.0|Wow the men in here are some good looking men and it Isaak need to watch for all women 18 and up!
B008220D7S|4.0|It had everything you can hope for in an Apatow film, yet lacked in every area. If you're a fan of his work or style of rom-com filmmaking, this one is for you. If you're not, go ahead and skip it. I can't imagine you'll enjoy this one very much.
B009KHBDUU|5.0|I am a huge Johnny Depp fan and like always he did great. It is a kinda funny movie, but if you like Johnny's acting it is a must see.
B005NFWCSK|4.0|I loved this movie.  I always enjoy stories that take place in the past.  I know they didn't keep the story completely true to the comics, but in this case it's a new direction that I appreciated by watching over and over again.  This is definitely a marvel classic.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|The Martian is the best new sci-fi book I have read in quite some time. One of the key features of a good sci-fi is letting the sci(ence)drive the fi(ction). Mr. Weir does this masterfully. He  references real near-future science in a way that is very believable and effective. While I could see how someone with no background in science and mathematics may find The Martian tedious, I think someone with an interest in, and basic knowledge of space travel and its related sciences will find it quite compelling. The solutions that the main character, Mark Watney, comes up with to help him survive are elegant, resourceful, and best of all, well described and scientifically plausible.<br /><br />The other part of the balance is keeping it interesting. Weir doesn't fall into the trap of writing a boring, \\"how to survive on Mars\\" list of problems and solutions. He created a believable and extremely likeable character in Watney who's self deprecating humor and understated genius really makes you feel for him. Weir even does a passable job at developing other characters with minimum page space.<br /><br />I left off the fifth star because I felt this book could have also explored the psychology of a man being stranded on a different planet by himself. NASA Astronauts really are the best of the best but I feel like even the most well trained and confident person would have a breakdown or two facing the most profound loneliness imaginable.<br /><br />That being said, The Martian was a great read and a real page turner. Highly recommended for any sci-fi fan.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I just wanted to be the 100th person to review it also love it<br /><br />and I like pizza and tacos
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|Usually the FAOTD is just okay at best. Osmos is wonderful. One of the best FAOTDs to come along. It remains to be seen as to how long I keep playing it. So far it's great!
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Be aware that this is like the fourth Star Wars movie - a necessary bridge that you have to walk over. I almost quit reading then got order and had itching else so I picked it back up and am I happy I did. Can't wait to read the next one.
B004P7CMUU|1.0|I give this movie one star, only because zero isn't an option.  And I can tolerate pretty bad movies.  Some bad movies my wife and I watch just to laugh at how stupid they are.  Not this one.  We couldn't make it past about 30 minutes.  The \\"acting\\" positively sucked.  This is one of the very few movies we have ever just abandoned partway through.  Thankfully we still had some unwatched Dick Van Dyke episodes to save the evening.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|The title caught my eyes.  Fishing in -- YEMEN?  Huh?  It's a romantic tale (albeit with some twists) involving two couples.  It's also about challenges of introducing a new idea to a place that is steeped in tradition.  People don't like changes.  They see it as a threat.  It's a hard nut to crack, and this one (introducing salmon fishing in this desert country) is no exception.  It's a wonderful story with beautiful scenery (in UK and somewhere in the Middle East).  The idea behind the movie leaves you something to think about.
B00AVIKMN6|4.0|Great special l effects!  What you would expect from the prior movies.  If you read the books you will like the movies.
B00A14SQBU|5.0|This album just puts u in a good mood. It makes you feel invincible and ready to take on the world, its haters, and doubters. Great Job Christina!
B00307OTDE|4.0|Jimi Hendrix's music is both classic and timeless. He really was a man that died way to early. Albums is a great listen though.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I saw the movie first..... the book is MUCH better. More detail...I could relate to the story,, I had a niece pass away from cancer
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|I couldn't get into the movie and stopped after 53 min. I guess I was hoping for a Dr. Zhivago-type movie, gripping and believable.<br />But this movie struck me as too stylized, and confectionary. It felt like the actors were puppets, or marionettes. (And I can see this as a commentary on the artificiality and pompousness of the nobility back then). The costumes, the dances, the actors themselves are of course beautiful, but all this did not make up for the lack of a truthfully told and deeply felt story. Which is what I want from movies like that. Perhaps the script could work as a play. I can see that. But I was very disappointed with this movie and sorry I paid $5 for it. So just an okay for me, though barely.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Kudos to the writers!  Loved this animated film.  One of those &#34;kids&#34; movies that the parents like too.  Highly recommended.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|A clever spin on traditional crime dramas... Elementary is brilliant!  I was able to catch up on some episodes I missed thanks to the Amazon feature.  If you've never seen an episode of this show, you're missing out!!
B002C4YYEU|4.0|It was a good movie over all and I liked the story but I was a bit dissapointed with the ending.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I found the book interesting, but too much lovey-dovey. It got sickening after awhile. However, it was easy reading and I wanted to go on with the story.
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|I had heard good things about the movie, but wasn't sure what to expect. My two year old daughter was locked in for the entire adventure, and I loved the old school game references.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|Long, but good. Interesting use of creative license on Abraham Lincoln's legacy regarding slavery and the Civil War but it was still good to watch.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Excellent story line, great cast of characters, extremely well written. I would recommend this movie to anyone. Very suspenseful and kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end.
B0031TZASY|5.0|Despite the serious situation Pi was in I found humour and witt throughout the book.  I found this to be an easy read and would recommend that you add it to your reading library.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|Ever since the pilot of Bones, I have tried to fowolled every episode of it. Except the last few. I will get those on DVD also.
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|The game was to short, and not as involved as ones I've been playing lately. It was sketchy with the loading in some spots also.
B00BP4Z8XY|2.0|Sitting through this film was like gorging yourself on Halloween candy to the point of making yourself so sick that you vomit tropical flavored starburst and sour patch kids...and let me tell you, that burns coming back up.
B0093X805W|5.0|It was so good. It was fantastic. It was the best book in the world. (Submitted by my 2nd grade students.)
B004QX07G4|4.0|This book had many laugh out loud moments and was a very light read. If you are looking for a more in depth book about Ellen's life and career, look elsewhere. This book didn't take long at all to read and was good for a few laughs.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love everything about this cool game. its fun you should get it if you don't already have it now.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I bought this book on a whim because the title sounded interesting, and I was blown away with how funny it was! I laughed out loud and often read passages aloud to my wife. Very very very funny.
B003TTKB5I|5.0|I love this show.  Missed the last couple of seasons, figured I would just start back at the beginning and catch up.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Almost as good as Jim Cantore in my neighborhood!  The app is clean and moves easily between features.  Always accurate!
B0069JBKHI|1.0|I am really frustrated! I bought it and shipped it to Qatar.  The camera didn't work, I emailed the withings company many times it takes them long time to respond.  Then, they decided since I bought it through amazon I have to contact amazon!! I am very upset that I lost 270$ !
B008NW67E0|5.0|Saw Mumford and Son on an awards show a couple of years ago, had no idea who they were, but love them now.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I have had my Case for over a year now and it looks like the day I got it in the mail. It holds my Kindle up right every time I put in the groove in the back and the strap has not even stretched out on it like I thought it would. I wanted to wait a while before I wrote a review just for the reason of being able to let people know how it holds up.
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|Purchased the disc because my husband like Ho Hey, found out we like a lot more than just that one song.
B0022CY8WK|5.0|This is a great soundtrack.  I could without a few of the extra pop songs, but the main soundtrack songs are awesome.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|So glad, that Phillip won American Idol, he is a true talent. Couldn't wait for the disc to become available.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love this series and book!  Sooo looking forward to the next book!  This is a great series to follow up 50 Shades of Grey!

B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Simple and straightforward. Powerful tool for growth. Easy to read.  I read this years ago and just decided to get Kindle version so that I can have it &#34;at hand&#34;.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Forces you to puzzle solve while also using memory retentive abilities. An excellent tool for young and old alike while having fun. Mahjong is the rage with most people I know, including my 8 and 9 year old grandsons. Its very obvious when watching their faces that they're immensely enjoying themselves and concentrating very much. The product I purchased has 247 versions with different levels that encourages you to want to improve your skills.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, top to bottom. Great actors, beautiful locations and a really sweet story. Perfect for Fans of Baseball

B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is the greatest TV drama to come along in many years, and I am finding it totally enjoyable.  I wish we could get more of this caliber TV.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love what they've done with this game. Evolution is by far the best Hungry Shark game I've played. I can't wait to see what's next.
0307592731|3.0|I can't say I have ever been in the brain of a &#34;HIPPY&#34; and I feel I have.  She was a free spirit type but a burdened soul that used the trek to free her spirit.  I hope it truly did.
B0027MJU00|5.0|It Freaked me out a little in some areas but worth reading! Looking forward to Gone Girl as my next novel.
0762777931|5.0|Great upbeat writing keeps you interested. Funny and interesting. I wasn't planning to when I started to read this book, but by the time I was done I was researching buying my first juicer!
B004LP3AYI|5.0|This is a page turner.  I am hooked on this Sword of Truth series.  I recommend this book.  Can't wait to read the others.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|Not sure if I blame AT&T, Amazon, or Roku for poor streaming experience.  It doesn't happen often, but this particular time it was bad.  Definitely not worth the $5 I paid.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Friends who belong to the same book club recommended it. I had no particular expectations and was pleasantly surprised.. Easy to read and hard to put down.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|A wonderful thought provoking story. It was not at all what I expected. I would recommend this movie to anyone and I enjoyed it so much I can't wait to read the book

B005OT2YVA|1.0|This movie was written for 13 year old boys.  The action was poor, so their was no salvation. It felt as if it was the longest movie ever.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A definate must !! Nicholas Sparks does it again! Could not put this book down, now can't wait to see the movie!
1401937519|5.0|This book helped me heal from past hurts. I gave up old limiting beliefs and have been happier since. I have listened to the audio book and read the written version. I have also bought copies for friends. You don't need to be experiencing cancer to enjoy and learn from this book. Just reading Anita Moorjani's life story was worth the price of the book.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|I took my kids to see this when it was in theaters and they loved it! (so did me and my husband!) The little hopping eggs was a nice touch, my girls will get this as an Easter present and I know they are going to be thrilled!
0141029196|5.0|I initially completely judged this book by it's cover. Brilliant choice for an amazingly well-written read!! Informative. Inspiring. Invigorating. Buy it.
B00866JL96|4.0|At first I was like, MEH...But I watched the movie and it is actually quite good you wont be sorry.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|I loved this book so much! It really got my brain going! I will definitely read this again and again!
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|My kids wanted to see this movie so I obliged. Intriguing from the start, the movie drew me in. A little thin on some of the plot lines, but that's ok. It kind of caused you to create explanations for those holes on your own, which is why this movie worked. Little too much strong language for my tastes, but that's how movies are nowadays. This is one of those movies that you will mull over for a few days after watching. I always enjoy these types of movies because I feel like I got my moneys worth. Give it a spin thing if you like sci-fi, action, and thinking about big topics.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My Horse is just like a real horse, so when I can't go visit my own it makes me happy!
B0067YF02Q|5.0|Great edition to one of the best films of recent years.<br /><br />Absolutely a must for fans of the genre. Eastwood pure.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Even though you know the end, this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.  The acting is superb and the sets bring you right back into the late 70's.  This is both a great movie and great history retold.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|jonney depp is getting to be a versitlle actor. i loved thew phase about alice cooper {he's the uglist women i've ever seen) that a funny saying.

0553801473|5.0|Been reading for many many decades and this series of books stands out as the best I have ever read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|-- A Romantic Book Affairs Review    Okay, I've obviously lost cool points for not reading Hopeless sooner. I saw the hype on every blog imaginable. My Goodreads feed was bogged down with hundreds of emotional status updates. And nine out of ten reviews were five stars. But I still put off reading it until my co-blogger read it and loved it and told me I MUST read it. So I did. And I loved it. Now, the problem I'm having is writing a review that will do this book justice. I'm feeling defeated by this task. How do you write a review for a book that leaves you feeling dizzy with awe, breathless, speechless, gasping for air? So instead of writing a full review, I give you my...    Top Five reasons why I fell hopelessly in love with Hopeless:    1. Two words: Dean Holder.    \\"Dean Holder? Messy brown hair? Smoldering blue eyes? A temper straight out of Fight Club?\\"    Holder, with his Hopeless tattoo on his arm, is the kind of bad boy that you will fall hopelessly in love with. I fell hard for him. He's passionate, complicated, confident, fiercely protective, and witty. He has lickable dimples and a coma-inducing hot body. And every time he walked on to the pages, he gave me butterflies. And last, but certainly not least, he cuddles. Yep, Holder is book boyfriend worthy.    \\"When I touch you, I'm touching you because I want to make you happy. When I kiss you, I'm kissing you because you have the most incredible mouth I've ever seen and you know I can't not kiss it. And when I make love to you--I'm doing exactly that. I'm making love to you because I'm in love with you.\\" - Holder    2. Sky Davis, our heroine, is a wonderful, smart, saucy, technologically challenged, snarky, broken but strong, brave, book lover, kind of weird in a cool way, beautiful inside and out, and I would love to have been friends with her in high school. Sky has never felt much, or anything, with a boy the way that Holder makes her feel. Up until they meet, any other boy has made her feel numb. AndHolder made her feel everything...especially lust. Lust is a whole new feeling to Sky and she didn't know what to do with it at first. It was awkward for her. And her confusion over her new feelings was endearing and funny at the same time.    \\"I've never been swept off my feet. I don't get butterflies. In fact the whole idea of being swooned by anyone is foreign to me... Somehow, in the course of sixty seconds, this guy has managed to swoon me, then terrify the hell out of me.\\" - Sky    3. The passion and fire between these two is so incredibly real and intense. The way they felt towards one another is beautiful. Almost magical. And holy sexual tension... these two have the best non-kiss ever. I think I held my breath the entire time they non-kissed. Holder is one sexy mofo with his teasing kisses on Sky's neck, cheek, eyebrow, shoulder...everywhere but the lips. That scene melted my butter.    \\"Sky, I'm not kissing you tonight but believe me when I tell you, I've never wanted to kiss a girl more. So stop thinking I'm not attracted to you because you have no idea just how much I am. You can hold my hand, you can run your fingers through my hair, you can straddle me while I feed you spaghetti, but you are not getting kissed tonight. And probably not tomorrow, either. I need this. I need to know for sure that you're feeling every single thing that I'm feeling the moment my lips touch yours. Because I want your first kiss to be the best first kiss in the history of first kisses.\\" - Holder    4. The secondary characters. Six is Sky's first best friend in the whole wide world and she is absolutely the coolest chick. She walks to the beat of her drum. I love her blasé attitude. I love her uplifting texts to Sky. I love how she loves Sky. I love how Sky and Six are so different but also so much alike. And they simply accept each other for who they are. This is a true girl-mance at its best.    \\"Sky, you are beautiful. You are possibly the most exquisite creature in theuniverse and if anyone tells you otherwise, I'll cut a bitch.\\" (Text message from Six to Sky)    \\"Only one day at public school and the bitches already made your locker rain?\\" she laughs. \\"Impressive.\\" - Six    And then there is the sassy, bold, and funny Breckin. On Sky's first day of school, he befriends her right away and becomes her second best friend in the whole wide world. He's gay, Mormon, and proud. Breckin rocks.    \\"Breckin shrugs. \\"I'm new here. And if you haven't deducted from my impeccable fashion sense, I think it's safe to say that I'm...\\" he leans forward and cups his hand to his mouth in secrecy. \\"Mormon,\\" he whispers.\\" - Breckin    5. The writing is amazing. Miz Hoover knows how to write an emotionally-charged story that made me feel every single word deep inside my soul. My mind went through a smattering of emotions that range from smiling and laughing (a lot!), lust, falling in love with the characters, sadness, shock, worry, nervousness, disgust, grief, acceptance, and contentment. The writing is flawless. It flows from word to word smoothly, keeping me enthralled from the beginning to the very last page. Miz Hoover writes my kind of snarky and snappy humor. I laughed out loud on several occasions. The humor adds charm and lightness to a story that could've potentially been overly dark. And the characters are so vividly real, I felt like I was living their life. Oh, and the twist. When we learn about the twist about halfway through the book, my jaw fell on the ground. It was completely unpredictable.    In case you haven't noticed by now, I loved this brilliantly told story. If you are one of the few people left, who love new adult romances, and hasn't read Hopeless, read the freaking book now! I can guarantee you are missing out.    With that said, I will leave you with one of my most favorite scenes. Sky is my kind of gal. I love the way she thinks...    \\"My locker seems to have become the hub for sticky notes and nasty letters, none of whichI ever see actually being placed on or in my locker. I really don't get what people gain out of doing things like this if they don't even own up to it.    Like the note that was stuck to my locker this morning. All it said was, \\"Whore.\\"    Really? Where's the creativity in that? They couldn't back it up with an interesting story? Maybe a few details of my indiscretion? If I have to read this s*** every day, the least they could do is make it interesting. If I was going to stoop so low as to leave an unfounded note on someone's locker, I'd at least have the courtesy of entertaining whoever reads it in the process. I'd write something interesting like, \\"I saw you in bed with my boyfriend last night. I really don't appreciate you getting massage oil on my cucumbers. Whore.\\"    I laugh and it feels odd, laughing out loud at my own thoughts. I look around and no one is left in the hallway but me.    Rather than rip the sticky notes off of my locker like I probably should, I take out my pen and make them a little more creative. You're welcome, passersby.\\" - Sky    Rating: A  Heat: Warm
1407130293|4.0|Good quality and good price. Enjoyed the read. Appears to be for teens but seemed to be more violent then i would like to have a teen read.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|So far, &#34;Clean Master&#34; has worked brilliantly to make my Kindle load a little faster.  You can't beat &#34;free,&#34; so I have no complaints!
0553801503|5.0|Been reading for many many decades and this series of books stands out as the best I have ever read.
B008GXO16C|5.0|If you want to listen to a real vocalist fused with real music, Kimbra has that and more.  She is on the forefront of bringing back real talent to a music industry which is sorely in need of more artists like her.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love all three books not just the sexual scenes but the characters and story line as well. I read all three books in under a week. This is the second time I have read them and enjoyed them just as much the second time around!!!
B009A87ZQU|5.0|The whole family loved the movie. My son has watched it many times. We will enjoy it for years to come.
1401924352|5.0|The product arrived on time and in mint condition. I purchased it for my own use I have read it twice all the way through and reference back to it all the time!! Fantastic choice for all ages really! I love Miranda Kerr as a personal and I really enjoy that while you read the book she pushes you to reflect YOUR SELF on YOUR OWN LIFE. That's EXACTLY what I was looking for!! Thank you Miranda!!! You are an inspiration! Can't WAIT for your next book! I have gifted this book twice to close girl friends.
B0099Y2YL6|3.0|I would have given this version of Season 3 5 stars but:  My rating is not a reflection on the movie content but with the packaging which includes commercials.  I also have seasons 1 and 2 that I purchased directly from the UK which are region free and those disks do not have annoying and time-wasting commercials on them and instead go promptly to the main menu.  This season 3 put out with the PBS logo on it was release here in the US has at least two commercials for PBS - it's like watching the series on television with the commercials.  However, you can fast-forward to the main menu to select the episodes.  However, I will not purchase season 4 when it becomes available from the US/PBS version for the same reason that it will most likely have commercial messages in it.  Seek out the UK version instead if that matters to you. I think it's a bit arrogant on the part of PBS (and other movie studios as well), to insert commercials into a Blu-ray or DVD.  After all, one purchases movies on Blu-ray and DVD not just for the quality and convenience but for the absence of time-wasting and annoying commercials.<br /><br />As for the actual season 3 (and 1 and 2) of Downton Abbey, well, it's \\"simply fabulous\\" as Thurston Howell III (from the 70's TV series \\"Gilligan's Island\\", played by Jim Baccus) would say in his Dink accent, and if you've seen seasons 1 and 2 you'll not want to miss season 3.  I can't wait for season 4.  The end of season 3 was simply riveting.<br /><br />One gets a true sense of what it must have been like to be part of a family of Lords around the turn of the 19th century in England and to have been brought up with the attendant privileges of such a station in life there.<br /><br />If I were rating just the production of Downton Abbey it would get a 10 on a scale of 1 to 5 - it's that good; actors, acting, scenery, costumes, dialog, filming, character development, and especially the filming.  After the 2nd or 3rd episode you'll be hooked.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I was an ardent fan of the Reacher books until the last three novels. Then the excitement seemed to drain out of them and they became boring procedurals, as if the author had run out of things to say. Reacher spends this entire book silently driving back and forth in the dark across the dull flatness of the Midwest in search of nameless and faceless villains who are never identified. There's none of the visceral thrill that marked his earlier adventures. The result is a waste of time for Reacher - and for the reader. Too bad.
B00A3SGWYC|5.0|Great album! Pitbull knows what he's doing! Its an album that keeps you pumped track after track. Definitely an album to let play during a small get together or a big party.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Don't like seth macfarlane's humor, my friends wanted to see it so i rented and hated it. But if you like stuff like that i guess it's ok.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|Hard to put away - far better than the movie!<br />Psycological thriller when it is best<br />Gives some after thoughts
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great, great show - can't wait to watch season 3 (when will it be available to watch on amazon prine?)
1400069289|5.0|A readable presentation of how habits are formed, and what one can do to replace unwanted ones with something else.<br />Very practical.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Who would of thought Gerard butler a surfer?  This movie is based on a true story and even know this is not action packed I couldn't break away from the tv until it was over ........great movie
030758836X|4.0|Very good and full of suspense! I was surprised in the end and thought the plot was very clever.  Great writing!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Having played a previous game by G5 I thought I would indulge in another. I wasn't disappointed & didn't mind paying for the full game. It really does suck you in & is very entertaining. I know some people have said it's too short, but you can go back & play in an advanced or expert mode. So much fun! Love the storyline & the graphics. 5 out of 5 in my book.
B003B02O3C|5.0|Love the way the book included a number of facets, from the daily life of a struggling law student to a court room battle and depair the of a poor family.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves an exciting, sometimes humor fast read.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|The book is flawed but free. The movie had a better flow then this book, but being the original it was good. I don't think I would've actually paid money for this, but it was good read for free
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|The book was okay but it appeared to be written for an audience of young females readers in mind, on general readers.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I am anxiously waiting for the third one to come out in June. I highly recommend it especially if you are &#34;50&#34; Shades lover!!!!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Predictable plot but still fun.  Great roles for comediennes.  Feel good.  Good music.  Just plain entertaining. Good one to watch with your teen age kids.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was very good, it kept me wanting to read the next chapter. Can't wait to see movie, hope it won't disappont.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|A great game. I really enjoyed this game from start to finish. Fun gameplay...challenging tasks...comical moments and it is completely free. 100% worth the download. I give HSE a solid A- grade...ready for more please.
0385474547|5.0|It's quite a good book to learn about the history and culture of Africa! The size is very comfortable to read.
0439023521|5.0|This book is a really quick read. You can probably finish in 2 sittings. It reads like a movie. Character development is great and you don't want to put down.
1452113432|2.0|I wanted to like this cookbook having. Already made 2 recipes posted on line.  However, so many of the recipes have ingredients that are either unavailable or hard to find.  I wouldn't make 75% of them for this reason and why I will return it.<br /><br />Beautiful pictures and chef as well though.
B0082Z447U|5.0|I loved this book--plenty of mystery and suspense!  Found it to beautifully written and well conceived.  His format of reviewing each characters testimony of events is unusual, but delightful to experience.  I have since read three other books from Willie Collins and really enjoyed each of them.  &#34;Woman in White&#34; is my perpetual favorite.  Highly recommend!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Season 2 just as good as Season 1 if not better.  I love this series and look forward to season 3.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is my favorite production of Jane Eyer it is the closet to the book that I really enjoy this production.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|Engaging series about a government unit that deals with effects of our interaction with an alternate/parallel universe. Very original story line.s
B00821OX98|4.0|I started watching this with hopes of seeing cool aliens... I saw those cool aliens. Good enough, right! :D haha
B0072OFM28|5.0|I have kept up with this series since the beginning. I was finally able to watch the second season in the past few weeks. I was worried that the actor changes for some of the characters would make the series different in negative ways. Andy Whitfield can never be replaced. However, with that being said, Liam Mclntyre has done a wonderful job. He keeps the character of Spartacus alive. Naevia's actor was also replaced. I didn't feel as though Cynthia Addai-Robinson did a bad job, but it wasn't quite the same.<br /><br />  All things being said, I still love the series. It keeps you on your toes, continues to have unpredictable twists, and continues to to be one epic ride!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|From the moment I started watching this show I was caught up in the story & the characters. I would highly recommend this show, can't wait for the next serason
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|What's not to like?  It's handy, easy to use, does nasty long division and percentages in a snap!  Best of all, it's free!
B009ANP4F4|5.0|My daughter was happy to get this and has watched it many times. It is one of the few she really likes.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Awesome game, challenging enough to not get bored, it's not nag ware, which I despise and it's not over in five minutes. Plenty of levels and just a bit of time limit frustration. I give it a solid 4.5. And for me,  that's high praise.
B007B5EDEG|2.0|I am so exhausted after the reading the complete set of waiting for them to actually get anywhere.<br />It is worse than watching some never ending TV saga - they all keep running around and around and NOTHING changes!<br />If just one of the Starks had met one of the others I would have been happy but no - they get frustratingly close but ...<br />How ever many books are we going to need to read until we actually get an ending!<br />Oh for an &#34;and they all lived happily ever after&#34;. I actually couldn't care if they all got killed for that matter by this stage - I just want something to happen.<br /><br />As for the ebook set I also didn't like the way there was no differentiation between books - may as well have been different chapters.
B008J2GAKU|4.0|Very good read. Amazing artwork. Very insightful into batmans world. I haven't read many comics since Spawn and this has gotten me right back into them.
B00BSBU4EC|3.0|Too scary for my children - 5 and 8. I didnt care for it. Didnt like the way some of the characters were portrayed. Didnt like the scary dream theme.
B001CDWFPC|4.0|I appreciate it a lot.<br />It is now my main Kindle Bible for my personal study.<br />Advise to new Kindle users:  To avoid loosing my place, I have a different Kindle Bible I open when I am church.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|As always very good entertaining and action packed! Worth the money! I would buy again and recommend to a friend.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|fun game.  not sure how to get more b's to play.  It shut two games off saying I had a bad call.  touched the correct number
0811875040|5.0|It's fantastic! The pictures are very beautiful and they're making me want to do them right now and it's very good to read something about the author!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|It kept my interest and events flowed from one subject to another without losing interest. Please sell more of these books.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|This was a really great novel. The concept was unique and the book kept you guessing the entire time. I highly recommend.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I had a hard time putting this book down. It was captivating from the first line. Well written. Great story! Nicholas Sparks rocks. I have not read anything written by him that is not good.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I downloaded this app because of a pop-up that kept showing up at the beginning of the My Little Ponies game we have for our Kindle Fire.  This game is fun and easy, and I don't have to worry about my daughter not being able to do something on it.  The only thing I think could be done better is that above the first few pets, it asks you to purchase &#34;Bling&#34; which is very expensive and I wish would have the capability of being disabled since my daughter doesn't understand what it is.  Since I have one touch payment she could easily purchase something without me realizing it.  Otherwise, great game!
B003VR5PPY|3.0|Vague spoilers ahead, but you should assume that going into reviews.<br /><br />To put it bluntly, I thought there would be much more to this title in length, if only to make up for what it lacked inherently. For the record, I've reached two endings and explored most rooms, and plan to save my DS the smashing of the D-Pad's right arrow in favor for a Let's Play or Two to see if there's much more to it. I truthfully didn't think much of the puzzles, and the fourth wall shattering text popups prevented me from gaining any sense of accomplishment or investment. What I thought was the mere beginning, where I decided only to keep playing to get my money's worth, turned out to be more than halfway through, and another playthrough didn't shake me of thinking this was a misguided purchase. Didn't mind the walls of text in the traditional RPG style nor the anime designs, but the struggle between developing the characters and allowing the plot to unfold became mechanic in nature from the beginning and made the cliches all the more noticeable.<br /><br />I will note that I was more satisfied with this purchase than Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective, another title I was suckered into by the acclaims.<br /><br />Edit: Watched all turnouts, opinion still stands.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|I bought this particular version of E.T. because I wanted the original theatrical release to show my daughter.  I'm strongly agains the practice of editing movies for later releases.  I don't even know what all they changed when E.T. was rereleased but I know that I didn't want anything to do with it.<br /><br />Best part?  Sitting down and watching it as a family and having my daughter start crying when she thought E.T. was dead.  It was so sweet and I remember feeling exactly the same way when I saw it as a child.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Not going to say much, in an effort not to spoil this book for others. Morton weaves details beautifully. Never saw it coming.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I LOVE THE WIZARD OF OZ!! This book has great literature and awesome charachters. Good for kids 8 through 12.
B00BFBSV72|5.0|It maybe just my Kindle, so it still gets Five Stars. Enjoyable. Addictive. Recomemded if you like Sonic or Doodle Jump (I am both :3)
B001ANSSDC|3.0|After seeing the movie, i read the book. The movie is very true to the book, but where they differ, it was my opinion that the movie did it better. So unusual!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I love my Harry Potter Box set! It is so convenient to have all the movies in one place and they are great!
B00BGZ8OLA|3.0|This is an exciting film during the second half, but the first half took too long to develope the storyline.  I still loved the special effects and the last few lines in the movie.  Can't tell you,  watch it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i thought that this game was sooo fun and its free so i would definetly reccomend it to you and even if you dont like it...it was free!!! get it!!
B00BETX5PS|2.0|This did not stand up to the better Bond films in terms of a story line.  Good effects, but boring overall.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|My daughter wanted to watch this for her 8th birthday. It was engaging, even for the adults. But it was clean enough and not scary enough for my 4 year old. What a fun family night!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Both myself and my wife have had lasting impressions from this movie.  First, what an incredible actor Denzel is.  Second, what a great portrail of a life of an alcholic and a redemption through not wanting to live a life of lying.  Be prepared to watch this movie on the edge of you seat.  WOW!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This is not the type of book I would choose, but since it was highly recommended I decided to read it.  It was much too long and at times I felt like it was a chore to get through.  That being said, I would still recommend it, especially if you grew up in the 60s.
B008J34466|4.0|I'm a big fan of Pink. I actually gave this CD as a gift and the receiver loves the album.
0345529057|5.0|Damn these books, I have lost so much sleep over these books. Great reads but you lose too much sleep over them. should come with a warning!
B002361MLA|5.0|I chose this rating because within this book there is truth and tools for true freedom.<br /><br />Because I enjoyed it<br /><br />Because it is worth reading

B0098XY5VK|3.0|This was an okay game but it's not for me.  I played it and kept it on my device for about 2 months but came to the conclusion that it was not for me.  But thank you anyway.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|After reading the first book, I was hooked.<br />The writing well done.  The story a page turner.<br /><br />I'm a fan of thus series.
B0091REZMW|3.0|This was an okay game but it's not for me.  I played it and kept it on my device for about 2 months but came to the conclusion that it was not for me.  But thank you anyway.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Do you really want to read a review of a FB app? Worse yet, am I really writing a review of a FB app?
B005HSL626|3.0|This was an okay game but it's not for me.  I played it and kept it on my device for about 2 months but came to the conclusion that it was not for me.  But thank you anyway.
B008K8VDPU|1.0|That's all I can say bout this one since I don't use it. They do and they don't like it...
B00A757EFW|3.0|This was an okay game but it's not for me.  I played it and kept it on my device for about 2 months but came to the conclusion that it was not for me.  But thank you anyway.

B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I loved this game.  Play it all the time on my Kindle Fire as well as on my home PC.  Challenging and addictive game.  Thank you
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|Don't fret on the price and get the P R O. It is worth it and an app you will use for years to come...
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great storyline, great acting and a fantastic job making it feel realistically in the time that it takes place. A must watch!
B0058S0OMS|4.0|It's a classic B horror film that spawned decades of copy cats. This is the original, it is great, it is a classic and it is worth having in your Blu-Ray collection...
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|It was a good book but I have no words for it. I am shocked at how much it costed.
B004S699K4|3.0|This was too little to late in coming. I think it has more to do with cash strapped actors than anything else, and that's what we got on film. Great script, poor acting and awful directing!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I just started playing this but is awesome so far!! Highly recommend this game to anyone who is into Sherlock Holmes, search-type games
B004VMUS9G|1.0|Waste of time, download and headache. I got Alarm clock and love it. The only xtreme here is the time you will waste!
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|This game is fun but it gets boring real fast when I first got it it was fun an hour later it was mad boring I recommend temple run 2 than this don't waste your 99 cents
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Whether you love or hate Adobe, this is a must have when downloading email with pdf attachments to read or see.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It's a really good game. I don't know how it's free I love it. In the epic breeding island breed fire williow for seasonal if it does not work do it the other way.Stilldragonvale has all cute drAgons.
B003XVYLDU|3.0|STORY WELL TOLD BUT A BIT BRITTLE AT TIMES<br />MAIN CHARACTER WELL DRAWN BUT OTHERS<br />VAGUE.<br />STILL WORTH THE READ
B008JGSM6G|3.0|exactly what was needed. this item was given as a gift and works great I would recommend it to others.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|love the walking dead and being able to watch the eopsodes when ever that i want to watch it .
B00AKKS278|5.0|I love the principles behind having a morning routine. Some have suggested you don't need the mornings to do all this. No you don't, but I believe it's the best way. The reason is when you go through your daily life, you can't control what happens to you. However you can control how you start your day. So no matter what craziness happens during the day, you've made time to focus on yourself and personal growth. Also it gets you ready for the day. If you feel grateful, do your affirmations, get the blood flowing, and focus on the goals you want to achieve for yourself in the morning, the rest of the day you're going to see the world through that filter.<br /><br />If you wake up and watch the news, check what your friends are complaining about on Facebook, watch some TV, grab a quick sugar filled breakfast and then head out the door to start your day, then you've set yourself up for a lazy and unproductive. Do that for 365 days and see what happens.<br /><br />I know because my morning routine did nothing for me. I worked at a restaurant so I didn't work till nights. I'd sleep in, watch tv, check my email, check social media, eat breakfast while doing this, and then do this until lunch time. After lunch, I'd do more of the same until it was time for work.<br /><br />Hal's book speaks to me like an old friend teaching me the best way to maximize my mornings. I like that he doesn't come off like a guru. He sounds like a regular guy who's overcome a lot in his life and discovered the one thing that makes him able to achieve so much in life.<br /><br />There's no guessing what you need to do. He lays out a plan for you that has not only worked for him, but his coaching clients.<br /><br />If you saw my Kindle book, it's covered in highlights and notes. So much great inspiration and lessons in it to review.<br /><br />I believe the people who think a morning routine is stupid aren't willing to try it. Don't dismiss it unless you've actually tried it. The worst possible scenario is you life is the same as it is. It definitely won't get any worse from following the routine that Hal outlines in the book.<br /><br />The best possible scenario is that it can change your life.<br /><br />Isn't that worth the risk?<br /><br />Just remember if you want to achieve something you've never achieved before, then you have to do what you have never done before.
B0058H8V6K|5.0|Definitely a good buy. I enjoy her take on music, it's fresh. The sound is young, clean and overall amazing.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|I had to switch from Google Reader, since that is going away soon.  I added it to my KIndle and really prefer seeing it on the Kindle, I find.  It is easy to move quickly from entry to entry-- I subscribe to a LOT of blogs.  The only disadvantage is not being able to return quickly to one I looked at earlier.  There may be a way I have not found yet.  This is less daunting and time consuming than moving back and forth on Reader.
B0095P3ULC|5.0|Its Transformers........If the transformers just played checkers...It would still be TRANSFORMERS....Stupid policy that I have to randomly keep typing words...
B000T9OP7G|5.0|Bought this second season after I fell in love with season 1.  Wish there had been more seasons of this great show.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Sometimes I need a &#34;fluff&#34; read.  No brainer, just a read for the fun of it.  A very fast read, enjoyable.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|I love Michael Connelly.  He keeps me guessing in all his novels.  I've read all of the Harry Bosch series and now am on to the Mickey Haller ones.  If you love to be kept in suspense, read anything by Michael Connelly!
B0081BU42O|5.0|This was a thoroughly enjoyable story. All of the typical Culture story elements were present, but this story was unusual in the very prominent role played by the ship's minds, more so than is even found in Excession.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I have never read the book nor seen the stage production, so I had no preconceived ideas about the movie/story before seeing it. Not only was I enthralled with the movie, I was moved to tears several times. I highly recommend it. The only jarring note for me in the movie was the young boy in Paris with the strong cockney accent - what was up with that? All in all, an amazing movie.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book had me from the start. I felt all the emotion of love and hate that was Travis and Abby. Abby's thought that she wasn't to be loved and Travis's weird way to express his love. Just a typical guys way of course. Jamie wrote this book so that you felt Abby's emotion's. well, at least I could. I really loved this book.
B006YGC7KK|5.0|This item arrived as promised and in good condition.  The series was much better the second time around and will be again!  Can't wait for the third season!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We really enjoy this show. The scenery, costumes and acting are superb.  Makes me want to go visit England to see the buildings and beautiful landscapes.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|I've bought every season of this series.  Hate to see it end soon.  Would recommend this show to others.  Enjoyed a lot.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a wholesome family drama! Plus it informs you about history and how people lived in those days. Like it alot!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I found the book to be quite entertaining. The pace of the story is OK, characters are decently well built, but there's something in the narrative that kept me telling I was reading a text written by a fifth grader about his summer vacations.<br /><br />I understand that the sort of infantile mentality with which Pat is portrayed is intended as a display of his messed up mental condition, but the way this technique is used is not only inconsistent throughout the text but it also adds an imbalanced naivety to the narrative.<br /><br />Even then, I thought the book entertaining and I'm curious to see how this was adapted into the movie, which I intend to watch soon.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|I'm not real big on analyzing music, but I know what I like.  Picked this up on the cheap from Amazon; thank you Amazon!  The first few times you listen, this group will sound a little weird/strange, but the album quickly grows on you!  I have played it over and over as the tunes are just catchy, striking, and just brilliant.  Especially love: Tessellate, Breezeblocks, Fitzpleasure,  and Taro.  If you are a lover of Good Music, no matter what Genre, treat yourself to something different, and something Wonderful!
B008OOYALE|1.0|I hate it. I should have looked at the reviews before I downloaded the app. I mean, when you try to expand, ( when you finally expand ) you have to spend all of your coins on it because you have to clean out all of the trees and stuff. First you spend your money on expanding, then you have to spend more money ( coins ) on clearing out the trees and mushrooms!  WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!!!!!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|The movie was great. It had lots of action and great subtle comedy from the expected actors. I would definitely watch it again.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I watched this movie all by myself because I wanted to hear and understand everything about it.  I had heard comments on it from others. I don't think everyone would like Life of Pi.....my husband for one, but I loved it.  I love the ending!!  The young actor did a superb job!
